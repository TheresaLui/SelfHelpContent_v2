# Best practices for authoring solutions

These high-level best practices help you create solutions that provide the optimal customer experience and that meet Microsoft standards for style, scannability, formatting, branding, and accessibility. For detailed instructions on these best practices, see the  **Authoring guidelines**.

| **Best practice**    | **Description**    |
| --- | --- |
| Focus on the purpose, the audience, and the structure   | An Apollo self-help solution provides an issue-based experience for customers and support engineers through rich media, diagnostics, troubleshooting, and resource links within a clear hierarchy and an easily scannable structure. An effective self-help solution deflects support tickets from engineers.    |
| Stay user-centric   | From the article title to the final call to action, focus on your audience. The user needs a quick but thorough response, including prompt confirmation that they've arrived at the correct issue and the appropriate level of query, followed by clear guidance throughout.       |
| Use the template   | The customizable template ensures that all required elements will be present, correctly formatted, and easily scannable.   |
| Align your writing style with Microsoft standards   | Optimize the customer experience and convey a helpful attitude by using concise, clear language and a friendly tone. Review the [Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700) and see the [Microsoft Cloud Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696) and the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700) for more detailed instructions.   |
| Ensure scannability  | Use short sentences. Avoid complex sentence structure. Avoid parentheses. Use bullet lists in place of long paragraphs. You can use bold font to highlight major issues or key points, but don't overuse bold. Follow the template structure, which helps the customer scan the solution to find what they need quickly.  |
| Use correct formatting   | Use [bold font for UI elements](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696&amp;topicid=42298), including button and blade names, menus, dialogs, and windows. Use code font in text for inline code and code blocks, parameters, values, language keywords, method and function names, and file and directory names.  Don't use bold for emphasis. Try to avoid formatting for emphasis, but if emphasis is necessary, use italic font, not bold.  |
| Check product, feature, and service names   | Use correct spelling and capitalization for product names, available in the [Cloud Style Guide A-Z list](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2696&amp;topicid=25353) (check under A for &quot;Azure,&quot; in the left panel). [Capitalize only product and service names, not instances](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696&amp;topicid=44732).    |
| Ensure accessibility for all users   | To ensure that your article is accessible to all users and meets [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/accessibility/SitePages/Microsoft-Accessibility-Standards-(MAS).aspx), provide alt text for all non-text elements—images, charts, tables, and video. At minimum, include a brief introduction and include descriptive phrasing in any link text. For videos, if possible, also include closed captioning and a video transcript.  |
| Make link text informative, don't use internal links   | Link text includes meaningful language that describes the purpose of the link (also ensures accessibility). Don't use internal links.   |
| Offer extended support    | Invite the customer to open a support ticket if the issue persists after they've tried the solution. This text is built into the template.  |

### Overview of Solution 2.0

Apollo is an insightful, powerful, self-help experience for our customers and support engineers. By introducing a single, customizable canvas, 
Apollo lets you create a solution that specifically targets the customer&#39;s issue and expedites the troubleshooting experience.

Following are the available Apollo solutions. For more information, including examples of media-rich components that you can incorporate into each solution, 
see the following links:

- **Issue-based solution**  – Focuses on single or multiple issues and provides targeted solutions.
- **How-to or conceptual solution**  – Provides procedural instruction and/or conceptual information.


### Capabilities

With this new approach to solutions, Apollo goes far beyond previous approaches—such as the Common Solutions article type, which is limited
to a simple text-based solution type and insight per article.

Apollo is a single solution that encompasses all solution types under one canvas, so that you don't need to author diagnostics in a separate config tool.

Apollo lets you combine text, images, diagnostics, charts, videos, and relevant data to build experiences that truly help customers to solve the issue themselves.

### Authoring self-help solutions

- Apollo solutions are aligned with Microsoft standards, including [[best practices](URL) for writing strategies and style, formatting, branding, scannability, and accessibility. This helps to ensure an optimal experience for all users.

- Apollo solutions are usually written by the Service Team PMs or SPMs. 

- Authors can easily author and manage Apollo experiences in Elixir.

### Experiences

Apollo solutions are displayed by two specific user actions in the Azure portal:

- When the user selects **Troubleshoot** 
- When the user selects a support topic in step 2 of the case submission workflow

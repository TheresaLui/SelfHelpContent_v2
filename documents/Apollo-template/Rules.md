## Validation rules

*[[Editor's note: Some of the following rules are being implemented in Elixir as warnings. This file will be updated when that work is finalized.]]*

These rules ensure that your self-help articles meet both the validation rules in Elixir and the Microsoft style guidelines. For details and examples, review the ![**Authoring guidelines**](https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/elixir/articles/AuthoringGuidelines.html).

- At minimum, the body must contain substantive content that clearly addresses the topic or issue. 

    - For an **issue-based** solution, the body contains a solution that specifically addresses the stated issue. 
    - For a **how-to** solution, the body contains conceptual or procedural information, or both.

- Use active, imperative verbs and present tense (not passive verbs; not past or future tense)

- Use contractions ("don't"; instead of "do not"; "you'll instead of "you will")

- Use sentence capitalization for all headings (capitalize only the first word)

- Check product, feature, and service names for accuracy, including capitalization

- Spell out product, feature, and service names on first mention, followed by acronym in parentheses ("Azure Active Directory (AAD)"), and after that, use the acronym ("AAD")

- Use "select" not "click"

- Don't use "please"

- Bold all UI elements. Don't overuse bold in text.

- Use code formatting for code (inline and block), values, parameters, properties, operations, methods, functions, language keywords, and directory and file names

- Enclose error messages in text in quotation marks

- Insert a blank line after every heading

- Insert a blank line <br> before each level 3 heading **fix**

- Tables must be created in Markdown

- All non-text content (images, charts, videos) must include alt text to meet Microsoft Accessibility Standards. At minimum, include an introductory sentence that briefly describes the content. â€“ **blocking**

- Link text must clearly indicate the purpose of link ("here" or "this document" is not sufficient)

- Don't use aka.ms links or links to internal documentation ("review.microsoft.docs")

## **Recommended steps**

1. This is a step with a link to an [external article](https://).<br>
2. This is a step with no link, blade, or instructions. Note that because the next line is a new bullet in the numbered list, no <br> is needed.
3. This is a step with a [link to a blade](data-blade:extensionName.bladeName.nameOfInputParam.valueOfInputParam).<br>
4. This is a step with code :<br>
```
	SELECT name, is_disabled FROM sys.sql_logins
```

This is an example of a bulleted list. Note that only 2 levels of bullets are supported (e.i. a sub-bullet of a sub-bullet is not supported)

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3
	* Sub-ItemA
	* Sub-ItemB

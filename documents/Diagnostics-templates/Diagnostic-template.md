# <-- This is the title of the solution. It is not displayed in the portal, however, an **H1** header is a required part of every file. -->

<!--issueDescription-->
## ** <-- Diagnostic Title --> **
This is text with a replacement token **<!--$tokenname-->[tokenname]<!--/$tokenname-->**. There can be more text and another replacement token **<!--$tokenname2-->[tokenname2]<!--/$tokenname2-->**. Note that the double asterisk used to demark bold text should be added before and after the tags demarking the replacement token.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This is a step with a link to an [external article](https://)
2. This is a step with no link, blade, or instructions. Note that because the next line is a continuation of the list, no <br> (br) break is needed.
3. As in the example above, this step contains multiple sentences. When a step has multiple complete sentences, the use of a period to end each sentence is acceptable.
4. This step does not have multiple sentences, so no period is required at the end
5. This is a step with a [link to a blade](data-blade:extensionName.bladeName.nameOfInputParam.valueOfInputParam)
6. This is a step with code:

```
	SELECT name, is_disabled FROM sys.sql_logins
```

This is an example of a bulleted list. Note that only 2 levels of bullets are supported:

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3
	* Sub-ItemA
	* Sub-ItemB

# We ran diagnostics and found that this runbook failed with the following error "Unable to find an entry point named 'GetPerAdapterInfo' in DLL 'iphlpapi.dll'"

## ** Runbook failed with the following error "Unable to find an entry point named 'GetPerAdapterInfo' in DLL 'iphlpapi.dll'" **
<!--issueDescription-->
This runbook <!--$tokenname-->[AutomationRunbookName]<!--/$tokenname--> failed with the following error "Unable to find an entry point named 'GetPerAdapterInfo' in DLL 'iphlpapi.dll'"

This error is reported when the runbook tries to make a call into that dll on an Azure Runbook Worker, but as that dll doesn't exist in a sandbox environment it fails. This is typically seen following a remote authentication failure and it is typically the authentication issue that you need to troubleshoot.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
---

## Scenario 1 - Failure to authenticate with credential + password
If this error is seen following a call to a cmdlet that is authenticating using credentials (i.e. not using a service principal with a certificate), e.g.
- Add-AzAccount
- Connect-AzureRmAccount
- Add-AzureAnalysisServicesAccount 
- Connect-PnPOnline

1. Confirm that the password/username in the credential are correct and that the password hasn't expired.

2. Check if someone has [enabled Conditional Access to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) as this too can break authentication and result in this error.

3. If the username/password is confirmed as being good but this has never worked then have change the code to use a service principal with a certificate for authentication instead of a credential with a password.
e.g.

```
$Conn = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection
Connect-AzAccount `
-ServicePrincipal `
-Tenant $Conn.TenantID `
-ApplicationID $Conn.ApplicationID `
-CertificateThumbprint $Conn.CertificateThumbprint
```

or

```
$connectionName = "AzureRunAsConnection"
$servicePrincipalConnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name $connectionName
Add-AzureAnalysisServicesAccount -RolloutEnvironment 'westus2.asazure.windows.net' -ServicePrincipal -CertificateThumbprint $servicePrincipalConnection.CertificateThumbprint -TenantId $servicePrincipalConnection.TenantId -ApplicationId $servicePrincipalConnection.ApplicationId 
Write-Output "Added account"
Sync-AzureAnalysisServicesInstance -Instance 'asazure://westus2.asazure.windows.net/analysis:rw' -Database adventureworks
ZA
```

## Scenario 2 - The account requires Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
If the account is using MFA then this will **never** **work** in an Automation scenario as a background job has no way to provide a new form of authentication when prompted.

## Scenario 3 - This error is seen and it doesn't occur following an authentication failure
Test out the code on a Hybrid Runbook Worker as this dll is available in that environment.

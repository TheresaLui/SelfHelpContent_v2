# I need to transfer billing ownership

## **Recommended steps**
* The Account Admin can transfer billing ownership to another user through the Azure Account Center.<br>
[Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions)
* Learn more about  Azure Administrator roles.<br>
[Azure Administrator roles - types, permissions and limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/)
* To know the 'Account Administrator' of your subscription - click on 'Subscriptions' on the left pane in Azure portal, select your subscription, click 'Settings', select 'Properties' and scroll down on the properties blade to view the Account Admin's email address.
* If your current Account Admin has left and you need to take over ownership, please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) so we can validate the transfer.

# I received a past due balance notification

## **Recommended steps**
You may receive a past due balance email if payment has not been made or was declined by your bank. To resolve the issue, follow these steps.

* If the subscription payment method is invoice (direct debit), please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.
* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The Account Admin can review & update the credit card in the Azure Account Center which will immediately settle any outstanding balances associated to the credit card.<br>
[Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions)

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine scale set **<!--$vmssname-->Virtual machine scale set<!--/$vmssname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** encountered an issue due to the custom VM image not being provisioned correctly. One common cause is that the custom VM image was configured as specialized but the VM scale set was deployed as generalized. Creating a VM scale set from a specialized VHD is not supported.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Please configure the image and deploy the VM scale set as generalized [(Reference)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/tutorial-use-custom-image-powershell#create-a-scale-set-from-the-custom-vm-image). Additionally, please review the below documentation on specialized and generalized images.<br>

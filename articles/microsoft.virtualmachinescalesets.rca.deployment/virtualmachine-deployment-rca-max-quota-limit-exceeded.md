# We found a Quota limitation on your subscription

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine scale set **<!--$vmssname-->Virtual machine scale set<!--/$vmssname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed due to the virtual CPU quota being exceeded for the requested resource.
<!--/issueDescription-->

We apologize for the inconvenience.  Due to various technical constraints, vCPU quotas for virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets are enforced at two tiers for each subscription, in each region. The first tier is the **Total Regional vCPUs** limit (across all VM Series), and the second tier is the **per VM Series vCPUs** limit (such as the D-series vCPUs).

## **Recommended Steps**

To identify the quota limit you are encountering for subscription **<!--$SubscriptionID-->SubscriptionID<!--/$SubscriptionID-->**, you can use the Azure CLI command [az vm list-usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quotas#check-usage).

**Submit Quota Increase Request**

* If you are encountering **Total Regional vCPUs** limit, you can deploy your desired size by following the steps in [Regional vCPU Quota Increase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/regional-quota-requests#request-total-regional-vcpus-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-the-help--support-blade) to submit a streamlined request for increasing the **Total Regional vCPUs** limit
* If you are encountering **per VM Series vCPUs** limit, you can deploy your desired size by following the steps in [VM Series vCPU Limit Increase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/per-vm-quota-requests#request-per-vm-series-vcpu-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-the-help--support-blade) to submit a streamlined request for increasing the **per VM Series vCPUs** limit. To increase spot VM vCPU limits, see [Spot quota: Increase limits for all VM series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/low-priority-quota).

**Consider Alternate Sizes or Locations**

Quota increase requests may take one or more business days to be approved due to business and technical constraints.  Please consider alternate sizes that are available to deploy for your subscription, you can use the Azure CLI command [az vmss list-skus](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vmss-list-skus) to check for SKUs available for your VM scale set, including the minimum and maximum VM instances allowed for each SKU.

# When I configure a custom VPN for iOS, the per-app VPN feature isn't made available.

## **Recommended steps**

Per-App VPN for iOS devices in Intune is currently only available to a specific [list of providers and partners](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/vpn-setting-configure-per-app). You also must meet the certificate prerequisites before configuring a Per-App VPN. 

See the [Intune documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/vpn-settings-configure) for information about all VPN connection types in Intune.

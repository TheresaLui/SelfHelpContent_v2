  Enrollment restrictions have been configured preventing devices from enrolling. As an Intune administrator, you can create and manage enrollment restrictions that define the number and types of devices that can enroll into management with Intune. You can create multiple restrictions and apply them to different user groups, and set the priority order for your different restrictions.<br/>
  <br/>To review your current enrollment restrictions, please review the following document <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enrollment-restrictions-set" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>

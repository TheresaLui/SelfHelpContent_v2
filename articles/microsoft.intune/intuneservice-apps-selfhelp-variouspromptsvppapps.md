# Users receive various prompts when they attempt to install VPP apps.

## **Recommended steps**

Users receive varied VPP prompts based on:

* Device enrollment type.
* How the app is deployed.
* If the device or user group is targeted.

For a list of why your users are receiving VPP prompts, refer to the [End-User Prompts for VPP](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/vpp-apps-ios#end-user-prompts-for-vpp) table in the Intune documentation.

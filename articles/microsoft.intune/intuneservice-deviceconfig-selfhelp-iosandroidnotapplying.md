# I'm deploying an iOS or Android policy and it's not applying to the device.

## **Recommended steps**

Follow one or more of these suggestions to help pinpoint why your iOS or Android policy isn't applying:

* Check that the policy is compatible with the OS version and device type. For example, policies for iOS Supervised devices will not work on non-Supervised devices. Likewise, policies intended for Android 8.0+ will not work for older devices.  
* Make sure the policy is correctly targeted to the user or device.
* Use the Troubleshoot blade to look for errors and other problems. More information on using the Troubleshooting blade for policy issues can be found [here](https://aka.ms/policy_troubleshooting).

# The PC client license software installation failed and said that "The software cannot be installed, 0x80cf4017".

## **Recommended steps**

The account certificate used to enroll Window PC clients has expired. Redownload the client software in the Intune classic portal > **Administration** > **Client Software Download**. The package includes an updated certificate that lasts for one year. For more information about how to install the PC client see the [Intune classic console documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune)

# The Android Enterprise devices in my organization are compliant with all of our policies, but they are still showing as not compliant.

## **Recommended steps**

If your devices use Microsoft Intune Exchange On-premises or Exchange Online Dedicated, you must:

  1.	Deploy an email profile for the Gmail or Nine Work for Android Enterprise app.
  2.	Deploy those apps as a required installation.

For more information about configuring policies for devices that use these environments, see the [Intune documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/device-profile-create).

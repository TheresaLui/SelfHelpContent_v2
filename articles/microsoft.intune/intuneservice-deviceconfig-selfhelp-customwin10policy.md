# I'm creating and applying custom Windows 10 policies, but they're not working.

## **Recommended steps**

Windows 10 OMA-URI settings need to be entered exactly as the Windows CSP expects, meaning that:

* URI strings are case sensitive
* Data type is entered
* Setting value is entered as expected by the OS

Intune does not support every OMA-URI available. For more information about Custom OMA-URI settings, see the [Intune documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/custom-settings-windows-10).

# We ran diagnostics on your Microsoft Intune subscription and found an issue

## **Recommended Steps**

<!--issueDescription-->
Your tenant has no mobile device management (MDM) enrolled devices with Intune. If you want to enroll and manage your devices through Intune MDM, choose the desired platform for further instructions.

If you are using a third party MDM or only App Protection features, no action may be needed.

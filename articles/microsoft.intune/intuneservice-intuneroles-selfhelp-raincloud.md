# I see the "rain cloud" error trying to open certain blades or "Access Denied"

## **Recommended steps**

Ensure the Intune role you are assigned has the "Organization | Read" permission.  For more information please review this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/role-based-access-control).  If after assigning permissions you still cannot access the blade please open a support case.

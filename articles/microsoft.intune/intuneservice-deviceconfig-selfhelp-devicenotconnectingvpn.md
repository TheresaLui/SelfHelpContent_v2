# I deployed a VPN profile to a device. Intune is showing that it was successful, but the device is not connecting to the VPN.

## **Recommended steps**

A successful status means that Intune has successfully deployed the profile as configured. However, these configurations may not match your network and/or authentication requirements. Review logs in the infrastructure and authentication service for more details about the attempted connection. You may need to work with your network infrastructure team, or the third-party VPN vendor, to gather and review logs.

# Why do some devices appear under Azure AD devices but not under All devices?

## **Recommended steps**

The All devices blade lists all devices that are enrolled in Intune mobile device management.

The Azure AD devices blade lists all registered devices and Azure AD joined devices. In addition to your Intune-enrolled devices, this blade may list additional types of devices, such as servers registered in Azure AD and hybrid Azure AD joined devices.

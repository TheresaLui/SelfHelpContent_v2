# Configure Devices - Configure certificates

## **Recommended Steps**

Let's review a couple common certificate configuration issues.

**When I try to install the Intune certificate connector on the NDES connector server, I get the message, "The password in the certificate request cannot be verified. It may have been used already. Obtain a new password to submit with this request."

This message means that you need to run the certificate connector installation as an Administrator.

**User devices are no longer receiving SCEP certificates from NDES.

It is possible that the Client Authentication certificate issued to the NDES server and specified during the NDES connector installation has expired or is missing. To resolve this:

1. Uninstall the NDES connector. 
2. Use the following details to request a new client authentication or server authentication certificate:  
   * Subject name: CN=external fqdn 
   * Subject alternative name (both are required): 
      o	DNS=external fqdn
      o	DNS=internal fqdn 
3. Reinstall the NDES connector with the new certificate. 
4. Sign in to the NDES connector. 
5. Restart the NDES server. Wait 15 to 20 minutes and then sync a device.

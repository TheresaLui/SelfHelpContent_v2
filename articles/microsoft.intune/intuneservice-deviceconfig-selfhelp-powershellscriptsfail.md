# PowerShell script extensions are installed, but scripts are not running or they have errors.

## **Recommended steps**

Follow one or both of these suggested steps to help pinpoint the cause of error.

* Check your logs for events relating to the script. Look for errors in the log files located in **ProgramData/Microsoft/IntuneManagementExtension/Logs**. 
* If you suspect an issue with the script you can create a test script to check that a script can run successfully. You must have access to the output path to view the test results. Create the c:\scripts directory on the client. Then use the following PowerShell script to deploy the test script:

   Start-Transcript -Path c:\scripts\ScriptProgress.log
   write-output "Script worked" | out-file c:\scripts\ScriptLog.log
   Stop-Transcript

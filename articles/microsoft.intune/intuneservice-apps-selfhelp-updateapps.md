# I've made updates to apps but I'm not seeing them in the Company portal app or on the device.

## **Recommended steps**

Sometimes apps fail to install because of device-side conditions. This can occur even when the deployment and installation commands work correctly. To ensure the device is in a state to install an app, verify that the device is:

* Turned on.
* Charged.
* Connected to the internet.
* Set up with an Apple ID, Google Play account, or Microsoft Account, if applicable.

Also make sure that the app version you are installing is newer than the version that is currently on your devices. 

See the [Intune documentation for more information about adding line-of-business apps.](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps-add#next-steps) In the article, go to Next steps and click the LOB apps page specific to your device platform.

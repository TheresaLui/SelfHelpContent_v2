# My devices installed their scheduled updates, even though I issued a pause command.

## **Recommended steps**

When a pause command is issued, devices do not process the command until the next time they check in to Intune. Because of this, your devices may have:

* Installed the scheduled updates prior to check-in.
* Been powered off when you issued the pause command. In this case, when the devices were powered on, they may have downloaded and installed the scheduled updates prior to check-in.

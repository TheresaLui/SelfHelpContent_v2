# Why are phone numbers not collected from all devices?

## **Recommended steps**

Phones that are categorized as corporate devices in Intune are not identified with their full phone number when, for example, you run a mobile device inventory report. Bring-you-own-device phone numbers are always partially masked with asterisks (****), and only show the last 4 digits.

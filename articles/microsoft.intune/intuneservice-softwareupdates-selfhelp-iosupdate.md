# My iOS devices are not updating to the latest OS versions.

## **Recommended steps**

OS version updates are only available on supervised devices and on iOS devices running iOS 10.3 and later. 

If your devices meet the version requirements, verify that:

* Device users are not postponing updates. 
* Current iOS update policy settings, such as restricted time periods, are not preventing updates from being installed.
    1.  Sign in to the Azure portal.
    2.  Choose **All services > Intune**. 
    3.  On the **Intune** pane, choose **Software updates > iOS Update Policies**.

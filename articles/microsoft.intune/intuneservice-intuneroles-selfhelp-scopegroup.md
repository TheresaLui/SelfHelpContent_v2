# I added a scope group to a role, but users in that role still see other users or devices.

## **Recommended steps**

Scope groups do not filter out users or devices.  Rather scope groups:

* Limit who users can assign policies or applications to
* Allow only specific users to run remote tasks on devices

If a security group is not within your scope group, you will not be able to assign polices or applications to the group. For more information about scope groups see the [Intune documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/role-based-access-control)

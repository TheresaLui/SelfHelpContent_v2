# Manage Apps - Android app configuration profiles

## **Recommended Steps**

Please follow the resolution steps listed below for this message:

**"Warning: You need to open the Company Portal to guarantee future app access. Press OK to exit the app, and then open the Company Portal."**  This prompt appears on an end-user device managed by Microsoft Intune when using Outlook or OneDrive apps to renew a certificate used for secure communication between the device and the service.  Please ask end-users to click OK on the prompt and open the Company Portal app to allow the app to renew the certificate.  Doing so will ensure the device continues to be managed by Microsoft Intune and have access to company resources.  Please refer to [this](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2018/03/13/support-tip-company-portal-prompt/) blog for more information.

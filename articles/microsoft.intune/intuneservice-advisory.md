# Advisory or How-To Questions

## **Recommended Steps**

On a Windows computer, conditional access only applies to:

   * The native mail app 
   * Microsoft Office 2016
   * Microsoft Office 2013 when modern authentication is enabled

To block Microsoft Office 2013 when modern authentication is disabled, an earlier version of Office, or to block all mail apps, you must:

   * Register the device in Azure Active Directory.
   * Configure Azure Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). To learn how to configure ADFS, see Set up SharePoint Online and Exchange Online for Azure Active Directory conditional access.

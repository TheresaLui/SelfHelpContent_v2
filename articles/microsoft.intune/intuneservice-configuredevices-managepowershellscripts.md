# Configure Devices - Manage PowerShell scripts

## **Recommended Steps**

Depending on your scenario, follow the appropriate troubleshooting steps outlined below. 

**The Intune Management Extension is not installing or downloading.**

Check and make sure that you've assigned a user group and not a device group. Devices within the group must be auto-enrolled or bulk auto-enrolled. Other enrollment types are not supported.

**PowerShell script extensions are installed, but scripts are not running or they have errors.**

* Check your logs for events relating to the script. Look for errors in the log files located in **ProgramData/Microsoft/IntuneManagementExtension/Logs**. 
* If you suspect an issue with the script you can create a test script to check that a script can run successfully. You must have access to the output path to view the test results. Create the c:\scripts directory on the client. Then use the following PowerShell script to deploy the test script:

   Start-Transcript -Path c:\scripts\ScriptProgress.log
   write-output "Script worked" | out-file c:\scripts\ScriptLog.log
   Stop-Transcript

# I deployed a Wi-Fi profile to a device. Intune is showing that it was successful, but the device is not connecting to Wi-Fi.

## **Recommended steps**

A successful status means that Intune has successfully deployed the profile as configured. However, these settings may not match your network and/or authentication requirements. Review the logs in the infrastructure and authentication service for more details about the attempted deployment. You may need to work with your network infrastructure team, or the third-party equipment vendor, to gather and review logs.

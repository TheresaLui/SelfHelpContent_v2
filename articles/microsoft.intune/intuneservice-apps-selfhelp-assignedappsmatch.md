# The applications I assigned don't match to what I see in the Company Portal.

## **Recommended steps**

* Make sure the device is enrolled and the targeted user is signed in to the Company Portal. 
* Make sure the user or device belongs to a group to which the application is assigned.
* Verify that you've assigned an Intune or EMS license to the targeted user.
* Confirm that the deployment type is listed as "available" or "required".

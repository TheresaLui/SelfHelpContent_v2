# I added a user to an Intune role but they still have full access to the Intune Admin Console

## **Recommended steps**

Verify the user is not a Service Administrator in the Intune Silverlight console.  Service Administrators in the Classic Portal have full permissions in the Intune Azure Portal.  You can check if a user is a Classic Portal Service Administrator by logging into the [Intune Classic Portal](https://admin.manage.microsoft.com) and navigating to Admin, Service Administrators.

# I added a user to an Intune role but they still have full access to the Intune admin console.

## **Recommended steps**

Verify that the user is not assigned to any of the following roles in the Azure portal:​
​
* Global administrator​
* Intune service administrator​
* SharePoint administrator​<br>

Verify that the user is not assigned to the following role in the Intune classic portal:​
​
* Service administrator​

Users in these roles have full access to Intune in the Azure portal. To check the role of a user in the Azure portal go to **Intune** > **Users**. To check the role of a user in the classic portal go to **Admin** > **Service Administrators**.​

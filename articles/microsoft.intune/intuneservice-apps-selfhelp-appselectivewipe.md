# I issued an app selective wipe, but I'm not sure it worked.

## **Recommended steps**

In Intune in the Azure portal, go to either of the following pages to see the status of the wipe:

* Mobile apps > App selective wipe
* Mobile Apps > Audit log 

Remember, app selective wipes remove data associated to the corporate account. They do not uninstall Office apps.

# My device failed to enroll.  How do I find out why?

## **Recommended steps**

The [Intune Troubleshooting Portal](https://aka.ms/intunetroubleshooting1) allows you to easily look up detailed information on a user's enrollment issue.  It will also provide resolutions for many common enrollment failures along with issues for policy, apps and other features.  Review the Troubleshooting Portal documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/help-desk-operators).

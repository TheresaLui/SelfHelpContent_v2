# My e-book is not showing up in the Intune portal.

## **Recommended steps**

Intune syncs with the Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) services twice a day.  You can initiate a manual Apple VPP sync anytime.  To learn how to manage iOS apps purchased through Apple VPP, see the [Intune documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/vpp-apps-ios#to-get-and-upload-an-apple-vpp-token).

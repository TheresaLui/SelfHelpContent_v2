# I added an ebook and it is not showing in the Intune console

## **Recommended steps**

Intune syncs with the Apple VPP services twice a day.  You can initiate a manual Apple VPP sync anytime.  Review this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/vpp-apps-ios#to-get-and-upload-an-apple-vpp-token) to sync your Apple VPP account.

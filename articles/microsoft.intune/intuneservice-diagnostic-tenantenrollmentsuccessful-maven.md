MDM Authority Co-Existence
  <ol>    
    <li>You can have both MDM authorities active concurrently if you already have Office 365 MDM enabled but you want to try Intune MDM.</li>
    <li>Admins who already have O365 MDM active can simply mark Intune MDM as active from the Azure portal.</li>
    <li>If you have Intune MDM but want to make use of Office 365 MDM: please open a ticket below and a support agent will help enable this for you.</li>
  </ol>

# What does "device cap reached" mean?

## **Recommended steps**

This notification is received when a user tries to enroll more devices than they are allowed. Go to **Device enrollment** > **Enrollment restrictions** to modify the number of devices a user can enroll. If a user has reached the device cap, retire a device to make room for a new one. For more information see how to remove devices in the [Intune documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/devices-wipe)

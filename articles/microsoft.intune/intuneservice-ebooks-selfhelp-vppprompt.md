# Users are prompted to join the Apple VPP when they try to install e-books. How can I prevent these prompts?

## **Recommended steps**

To prevent sign-up prompts, assign e-book licenses to security groups that have managed Apple IDs. The Apple ID assigned to the security group must match the Apple ID used on the device.

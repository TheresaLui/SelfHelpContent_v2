# My users are getting prompted to join the Apple Volume Purchase Program before they can install a book.  How do I prevent that?

## **Recommended steps**

If you assign licenses to security groups with the managed Apple IDs of your users they will not be prompted for their Apple ID.  The Apple ID in the security group must match the Apple ID used on the device.

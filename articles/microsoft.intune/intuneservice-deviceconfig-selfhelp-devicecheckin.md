# Can I change how often my devices check into Intune?

## **Recommended steps**

No, device check-ins are on a fixed schedule. As an admin, you can force a device check-in, also referred to as a sync, from Intune in the Azure portal. Device users can force a check-in from the Company Portal. For more information about Intune's device check-in schedule, see the [Intune documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-mobile-devices-to-get-a-policy-or-apps-after-they-have-been-assigned).

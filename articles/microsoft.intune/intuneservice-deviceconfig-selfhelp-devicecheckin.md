# Can I change how often my devices check into Intune?

## **Recommended steps**

You can only apply work policies to devices that are enrolled as Android Enterprise devices. Android enterprise is a set of Android device features and services that separate personal apps and data from a work profile containing work apps and data. To support Android work profiles in Intune, you must connect your Android Enterprise account with your organization's Intune account. 

No, device check-ins are on a fixed schedule. As an admin, you can force a device check-in, also referred to as a sync, from Intune in the Azure portal. Device users can force a check-in from the Company Portal. For more information about Intune's device check-in schedule, see the (Intune documentation)[https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-mobile-devices-to-get-a-policy-or-apps-after-they-have-been-assigned].

# Enroll Devices - Android enrollment

## **Recommended steps**

Let's take a look at a few common Android enrollment issues and how to resolve them:

**"Device is not Encrypted"** - Newer versions of Android, particularly starting with v7.0, require a startup passcode to make sure that your device is fully encrypted. Different device manufacturers have varying descriptions and locations for the startup passcode. Most of the time, this setting is referred to as "Secure Startup."  Common solutions are to enable a startup pin or fully encrypt the device.  For more information review [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/your-device-appears-encrypted-but-cp-says-otherwise-android).

**"Devices fail to check in with the Intune service or display as "Unhealthy" in the Intune admin console"** - Some Samsung 4.4 and 5.5 devices may not check into the service.  There are 3 possible solutions to this issue:  **1.** Manually open the Intune Company Portal app and perform a device sync. **2.** Update the device to Android 6.0 or higher **3.** Disable Samsung Smart Manager from managing the Intune Company Portal.  Review [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-device-enrollment-in-intune#devices-fail-to-check-in-with-the-intune-service-and-display-as-unhealthy-in-the-intune-admin-console) for further details on these issues and resolutions.

**"User License Type Invalid or User Name Not Recognized"** - The user is not assigned an Intune or EMS license.  You can assign licenses to each of your users in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UserManagementMenuBlade/All users) or the [Office 365 Admin Center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal).  For more information on how to license users please review [Azure user licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/license-users-groups) or [Office 365 user licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/licenses-assign).

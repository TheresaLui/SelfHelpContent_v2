# I enabled an app protection policy that does not require device enrollment. However, users are still being prompted to set a device PIN.

## **Recommended steps**

When you enable Encrypt app data, your users may be required to set up and use a PIN to access their device. For more information about this setting's behavior, see the [Data relocation settings, Encrypt app data setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-protection-policy-settings-ios#data-relocation-settings) in the Intune documentation.

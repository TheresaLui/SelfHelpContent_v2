# What is the difference between an Android and Android Enterprise?

## **Recommended steps**

You can only apply work policies to devices that are enrolled as Android Enterprise devices. Android enterprise is a set of Android device features and services that separate personal apps and data from a work profile containing work apps and data. To support Android work profiles in Intune, you must connect your Android Enterprise account with your organization's Intune account. 

If you have Android and Samsung Knox standard devices, you can apply only Android policies to your devices. A separate work profile is not configured on the device.

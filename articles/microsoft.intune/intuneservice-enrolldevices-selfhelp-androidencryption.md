# My android device is encrypted but the Company Portal says it's not.

## **Recommended steps**

Android 7.0 and later require a startup passcode to make sure that the device is fully encrypted. The device setting is often called **Secure Startup**. However, descriptions and locations of startup passcodes vary between device manufacturers.

To resolve, enable a startup pin or encrypt the entire device. For more information about each solution, see the [Intune documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/your-device-appears-encrypted-but-cp-says-otherwise-android)

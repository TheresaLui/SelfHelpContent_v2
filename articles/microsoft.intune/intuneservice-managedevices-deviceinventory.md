# Manage Devices - Device inventory

## **Recommended Steps**

Let's review a couple common device inventory issues.

**Why are phone numbers not collected from all devices?

Phones that are categorized as corporate devices in Intune are not identified with their full phone number when, for example, you run a mobile device inventory report. Bring-you-own-device phone numbers are always partially masked with asterisks (****), and only show the last 4 digits.

**I am not receiving a full inventory list of applications present on Intune-enrolled Windows devices. Why?

Only modern apps are listed for Windows 10 PCs that are identified as corporate devices. Intune doesn't collect information about Win32 apps installed on these devices.

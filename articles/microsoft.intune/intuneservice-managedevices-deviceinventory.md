# Manage Devices - Device inventory

## **Recommended Steps**

Depending on your scenario, follow the appropriate troubleshooting steps outlined below. 

**Why are phone numbers not collected from all devices?**

Phones that are categorized as corporate devices in Intune are not identified with their full phone number when, for example, you run a mobile device inventory report. Bring-you-own-device phone numbers are always partially masked with asterisks (****), and only show the last 4 digits. For more information on data your company can see when devices are enrolled go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune).

**I am not receiving a full inventory list of applications present on Intune-enrolled Windows devices. Why?**

Only modern apps are listed for Windows 10 PCs that are identified as corporate devices. Intune doesn't collect information about Win32 apps installed on these devices.

# I don’t see my Mac device under Intune in the Azure portal. It is, however, showing under Azure Active Directory.

## **Recommended steps**

Complete the following steps to make sure Jamf is integrated with Intune.

1. Go to the Jamf self-service portal and launch the Company Portal app. For information about how to install and configure Jamf with Intune, see the following articles:

   * (Microsoft Intune and Jamf Pro: Better Together to Manage and Secure Macs)[https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/12/14/microsoft-intune-and-jamf-pro-better-together-to-manage-and-secure-macs/)
   * (Integrate Jamf Pro with Intune for compliance)[https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/conditional-access-integrate-jamf]

2. Tell the device owner to go to the Jamf self-service portal and re-run the device registration policy.  The Mac OS should now appear under the Intune device list in the Azure portal as well as in Azure AD.

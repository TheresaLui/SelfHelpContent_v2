# DevSetup Install Issues

## **Error: Docker version 'x.xx.x' is required**

Q: When running `DevSetup.ps1` in step 3, from the section **Windows 10 VM Setup and Cloud Deployment**, found in **Tutorial 2: Deploy the Connected Vehicle Platform**, I get an error `Docker version 'x.xx.x' is required. Installed version ''`, when running the following script `.\packages\Microsoft.Azure.ConnectedCar.Deployment.*\DevSetup.ps1`.

A: Wait until Docker has started then rerun the `DevSetup.ps1` script.

## **Error: ‘keyvault_objectid’ is null**

When running `DevSetup.ps1` in step 3, section **Windows 10 VM Setup and Cloud Deployment**, found in **Tutorial 2: Deploy the Connected Vehicle Platform**, the error `‘keyvault_objectid’ is null` occurs when deploying to the KeyVault.

## **Recommended Steps**

There are two possible causes for the error `‘keyvault_objectid’ is null`:

1. When you have logged into the subscription or you have logged into multiple subscriptions.
    - Before running the `DevSetup.ps1` script, set the last parameter as  `-Automation $true` which will force you to login to your subscription
    - Log into your subscription using the script 'Connect-AzAccount -TenantId {your tenantID} -SubscriptionId {your subscription}' before running `DevSetup.ps1`

2. When you have two formats of the same account, e.g. first.last@company.com and firstlast@company.com
    - Contact the Connected Vehicle Platform team to update your account registration in Active Directory

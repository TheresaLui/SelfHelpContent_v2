# Send Command

## Error: BadRequest

Q: When following the Send a Command instructions found in the **Tutorial: Send, Receive, and Respond to a Command**, the status code resulted in a `BadRequest`
A: There are a number of reasons this error may occurâ€”the most common are the following:

1. Incorrect vehicle or device name in the Command Extension

- Repeat step 2 from the **Tutorial: Send, Receive, and Respond to a Command** and redeploy your command extension.

2. Missing claims for the vehicle

- Add the missing claim for the vehicle.  Follow the instructions to **Create Claims for Vehicle Telemetry** found in the **Tutorial: Deploy the Sample Claims Application and Create Claims**.  Then rerun the section **Send a Command** in the **Tutorial: Send, Receive, and Respond to a Command**.

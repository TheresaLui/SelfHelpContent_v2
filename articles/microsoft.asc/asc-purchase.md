# ASC/Purchasing

## **Recommended Steps**
**I have mistakenly purchased an SSL certificate for the wrong domain. Can I get a refund?**
The App Service certificate will be billed only when the certificate is in an Issued state. If the certificate is in a Pending Issuance state, you can delete it without getting charged. However, as soon as the certificate is in an Issued state, there is no option to get a refund.

**What do certificate statuses mean, as shown by diagnostics?**
	• Issued - Certificate is issued and ready for use.
	• Pending Issuance - Certificate issuance is pending on domain ownership verification by customer.
	• Denied - Certificate renewal failed because domain ownership verification was not completed within 45 days. The certificate will be valid until its expiration date and then revoked. The customer needs to request a new certificate.
	
**What can I check if domain verification is not completing?**
There are three ways to do domain verification. If one of these options isn't working, try the others:
	• HTML file: Host an HTML file at the root of the web server hosting the domain.
	• DNS TXT record: Create a TXT record for the root domain.
	• Email: Click the verification link included in the mail sent to the email addresses associated with the domain.

# ASC/Renewing-Rekeying

## **Recommended Steps**

The following solutions help most customers who have issues with hostname binding not updating after the certificate auto-renews.

## What can I check if hostname binding is not updated after certificate auto-renewal?

* It can take up to 48 hours for sync operation to update the hostname bindings. You can wait or try a manual Sync operation from the Azure portal. To manually run a sync operation, select **Certificate** > **Rekey and Sync** > **Sync**

- Check the required permissions on Key Vault:
	
  |Service Principal|Secret Permissions|Certificates|
  |--|--|--|
  |Microsoft Azure App Service|Get|Get|
  |Microsoft.Azure.CertificateRegistration|Get,List,Set,Delete|Get,List|

- Try the **Rekey** option and wait for the sync operation to update the binding. Rekeying your certificate will roll the certificate with a new certificate issued from the certificate authority. Certificate rekey operations are free and rekey does not incur additional charges.

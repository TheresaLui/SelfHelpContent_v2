# ASC/Domain Verification taking too long or not completing

## **Recommended Steps**

**What do the certificate statuses mean as shown by diagnostics?**

- **Issued** - Certificate is issued and ready for use.

- **Pending Issuance** - Certificate issuance is pending on domain ownership verification by customer.

- **Denied** - Certificate renewal failed as domain ownership verification was not completed within 45 days. The certificate will be valid till its expiration date and then revoked. Customer need to request for a new certificate.

**What can I check if domain verification is not completing?**
 
 * Click on the "Verify" button to open the Domain Verification window
 * At the top, you would see a Domain Verification Token which is a randomly generated identifier that helps in the verification process.
 
 There are three ways to validates domain ownership:

   1. HTML file: Host an HTML file at the root of the webserver hosting the domain
   2. DNS TXT record: Create a TXT record for the root domain
   3. Email: Click on the verification link included in the mail sent to the Email addresses associated with the domain

# I received a past due balance notification

## **Recommended steps**

You may receive a past due balance email if payment has not been made or was declined by your bank. To resolve the issue, follow these steps.

* If the subscription payment method is invoice (direct debit), please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The Account Admin can review and update the credit card in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).<br>
[How to update payment info](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/)

To determine the **Account Administrator** of your subscription - click **Subscriptions** on the left pane in Azure portal, select your subscription, under **Settings**, select **Properties** and scroll down on the properties blade to view the Account Admin's email address. <br>

If the bill notice was not received because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles, please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) so we can resolve the issue.

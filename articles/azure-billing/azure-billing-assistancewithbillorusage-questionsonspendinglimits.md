# questions on spending limits

## **Recommended Steps**

### Remove spending limit in Account Center

1. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).
2. Select a subscription. If the subscription is disabled due to the spending limit being reached, click this notification: "_Subscription reached the Spending Limit and has been disabled to prevent charges._" Otherwise, click **Remove spending limit** in the **Subscription Status** area.
3. Select an option that is appropriate for you.<br>
   i. **Remove spending limit indefinitely** will remove the spending limit without turning it on automatically at the start of the next billing period.<br>
   ii. **Remove spending limit for the current billing period** will remove the spending limit so that it turns back on automatically at the start of the next billing period.<br>
	
_Note:_ We don’t support custom spending limits <br>

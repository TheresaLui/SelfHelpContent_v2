# I need to transfer billing ownership

## **Recommended steps**

1. [Find out who's the Account Admin](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade).

2. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Admin.

3. Select the subscription for which you want to transfer billing ownership.

4. On the right side of the page, select **Transfer Subscription**.

If your current Account Admin has left and you need to take over ownership, please open a support request so we can validate the transfer.

# I need to transfer billing ownership

## **Recommended steps**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to transfer billing ownership.

3. On the right side of the page, select **Transfer Subscription**.

4. Follow prompts to complete the transfer.

To determine the **Account Administrator** of your subscription - select **Properties** on the left and scroll down to view the Account Admin's email address. <br>

If your current Account Admin has left and you need to take over ownership, please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) so we can validate the transfer.

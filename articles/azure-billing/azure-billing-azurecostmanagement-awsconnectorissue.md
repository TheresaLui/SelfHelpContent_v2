# Azure Cost Management - AWS connector issue

## **Recommended Steps**

**Troubleshooting AWS integration**<br>

* **Iâ€™m unable to create a connector using my AWS credentials**<br>
This may happen due to the following reasons:

  1. Invalid AWS credentials. Please check your AWS credentials and whether they are active.
  2. Only 1 connector can be created for a consolidated account. Hence, if someone has already created a connector for the same consolidated account, we suggest you reach out to them to grant you access to the connector.
  
 * **I want to view my Azure and AWS costs together**<br>
 In order to view Azure and AWS costs together, we take the help of Management Group scopes in Azure and follow the steps:
 
   1. Create a Management Group or select an existing one<br>
   2. Assign existing and appropriate Azure subscriptions to the management group<br>
   3. Assign the Same Management Group to the **Linked Account** of the connector<br>
   4. Go to **Cost Analysis** and select **Accumulated costs**<br>
   5. Select **Group by Provider**<br>

* **I want to change the Management Group of my Linked Account**<br>

   1. Click on the Connector which has the appropriate Linked Account<br>
   2. Click on Consolidated Account<br>
   3. Click on **Change Management Group**<br>
   4. Select the **Management Group and Linked Account**

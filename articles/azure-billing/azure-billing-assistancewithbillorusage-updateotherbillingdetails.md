### **Frequently asked questions**

* **Can notifications be sent to a different email address other than the Account Administrator email address associated with my account?**<br>
Yes. The email address on the account gets important notifications about all the subscriptions under the account. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that the Account Administrator checks regularly.

* **Can I change the Account Administrator email address in my profile?**<br>
Yes. The Account Administrator is the person who set up the Azure account and who receives important email notifications about all the subscriptions under the account. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that the Account Administrator checks regularly.

* **Does updating my profile email also update my login email address?**<br>
No. Updating the profile email address does not update your login email address. To change your login email address, you have to transfer ownership of the account.

* **Does updating my profile address also update my credit card billing address?**<br>
To learn how to update your billing information, see [Change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card). <br>

* **Why can’t I update the country?**<br>
Because of technical constraints, we cannot change the country on an existing account. However, you can create an account in the desired country and then migrate your services to that account.

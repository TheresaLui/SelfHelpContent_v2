## **Recommended steps**

Please continue to open a support request. Once your request has been approved, you will be provided instructions on how to set up your subscription for the invoice payment method. 

Please have the following information at hand:

- Your name

- Microsoft Account, also known as the Windows Live ID (the one you will associate with your Azure account)
- Company name
- Company website URL
- Preferred email address

A credit check may be required depending on the amount of credit required. In these instances, customer support will provide you with a credit check application. After submission, the credit application can take 5-7 business days to process.<br>

# pay by invoice

## **Recommended steps**

Please continue to open a support request. Once your request has been approved, you will be provided instructions on how to set up your subscription for the invoice payment method. 

A credit check may be required depending on the amount of credit required. In these instances, customer support will provide you with a credit check application. After submission, the credit application can take 5-7 business days to process.<br>

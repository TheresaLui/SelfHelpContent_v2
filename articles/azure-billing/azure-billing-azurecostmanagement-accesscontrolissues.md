# Access Control Issues

**What does 'costs are disabled for your organization' mean?**<br>
Organizations using Enterprise Agreement (EA) or Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) accounts can disable access to cost and pricing information.<br> 

EA billing account admins can review and update cost visibility by going to Cost Management + Billing > (select a billing account) > Policies. 'Department admin can view charges' (DA) determines whether a department admin can see costs for their departments. 'Account owner can view charges' (AO) determines whether enrollment account admins and RBAC users can see costs for the specific scopes they have access to (RBAC rules apply).<br>

MCA billing account owners can toggle cost visibility ('View charges') from Cost Management + Billing > Billing profiles > (select profile) > Policies. Billing profile owners will open their billing profile directly from Cost Management + Billing. Within MCA, cost visibility can be granularly enabled or disable per billing profile.<br>

Whether you are using an EA or MCA account, all cost visibility settings are recommended to be enabled to ensure everyone within the organization is aware of the fiscal impact they’re making with their cloud architecture choices and has an opportunity to optimize them.<br>
 
CSPs and Indirect EAs have their reseller enable Markup for them to be able to view costs in Azure Cost Management.<br>

You can grant access for Azure billing information to members of your team by assigning one of the following user roles to your subscription: Account Administrator, Service Administrator, Co-administrator, Owner, Contributor, Reader, and Billing Reader. They would have access to billing information in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and they can use the Billing APIs to programmatically get invoices (once opted-in) and usage details.

**How to allow additional users to access invoices:**

1. As the Account Administrator, select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal<br>
2. Select Invoices and then Access to invoices.<br>
3. Turn On the access followed by saving the changes, to allow users in subscription scoped roles to download invoice.<br>
4. The Account Administrator can also configure to have invoices sent via email. To learn more, see [Get your invoice in email](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date).<br>

**How to add users to the Billing Reader role:**

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal.<br>
2. Select Access control (IAM) and then click **Add**.<br>
3. Choose Billing Reader in the Select a role page.<br>
4. Type the email for the user you want to invite, then click **OK** to send the invitation.<br>
5. Follow instructions in the invite email to log in as a Billing Reader.<br>

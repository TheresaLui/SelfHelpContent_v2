# Help me understand when I will be charged


### **Help me understand when I will be charged**

The anniversary day is the day of the month you purchased the subscription. The invoice is generated on the anniversary date and 10 days later the credit card is charged. Invoice customers need to pay using Wire transfer/check and the details for payment is available on your monthly invoice.<br>
For example, if you purchased the subscription on January 15th, the anniversary day will be the 15th of each month when the invoice is generated and 10 days later the card is charged.<br>

### **Understand charges on an Azure free account**

Azure free trial account is only for 1 month and once it is upgraded to pay-g there will be 12 month free services. The Azure free account includes free access to the most popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 credit to spend for the first 30 days of sign up, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. If you are seeing a charge, it is likely possible that it is not one of the listed products that are available monthly, for free.<br>
Note, you would need to upgrade to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) after the first 30 days in order to continue using the Free Account for the remaining 11 months and you would not be charged if you stayed within the free service limits.<br>

### **Understand charges on Azure for Students account**

Azure for Students gets you started with $100 in Azure credits to be used within the first 12 months plus select [free services](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/#free-products-section) (subject to change) without requiring a credit card at sign-up. If you are seeing a charge or unable to deploy a new service, it is likely you have used up your credits or it is outside the available free services. <br>

* Wait until the next billing cycle when new credits would be added and the subscription would be automatically enabled, **or**
* If you have a [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or an [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription, you can upgrade to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) in the Azure portal: [Upgrade subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription)

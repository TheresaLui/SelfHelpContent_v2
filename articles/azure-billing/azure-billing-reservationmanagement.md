# Reservation Management

Azure customers with these subscriptions types can purchase a reserved instance :

* Enterprise agreement subscription offer type (MS-AZR-0017P).<br>
* [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) subscription offer type (MS-AZR-003P). You must be in the role “Owner” on the subscription to buy a reserved instance. For purchasing reserved instances in an enterprise enrollment, the enterprise administrator must enable reserved instance purchases in the EA portal. By default, this setting is enabled.<br>
* Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners can use Azure Portal or [Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-reservations) to purchase reserved instances.

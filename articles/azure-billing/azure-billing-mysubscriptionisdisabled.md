# My subscription is disabled

## **Recommended steps**
Here are some common reasons a subscription can get disabled and how you can re-enable it.

* You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month.<br>

* A payment may be past due.<br>

* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can reactivate it in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). If it's not, please have the Account Admin open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade).

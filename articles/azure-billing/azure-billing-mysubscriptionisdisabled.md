# My subscription is disabled

## **Recommended steps**
Here are some common reasons a subscription can get disabled and how you can re-enable it.

* You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month.<br>
[Learn more about Spending Limit and how to remove it](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/)

* A payment may be past due.<br>
[Address past due balance](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance/)

* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can reactivate it in the Azure Account Center. If it's not, please continue to open a support request.

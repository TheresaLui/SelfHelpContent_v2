# My Azure subscription is disabled. How can I reactivate it?

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Find your Account Administrator](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade)
* You may have reached the spending limit. The Account Administrator can [remove the spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/).
* A payment may be [past due and require addressing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance/)
* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can [reactivate it](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-subscription-become-disable#the-subscription-was-canceled-by-the-account-administrator) in the Account Center.

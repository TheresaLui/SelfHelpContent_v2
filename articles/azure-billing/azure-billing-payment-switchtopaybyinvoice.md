# Switch to pay by invoice

## **Recommended Steps**

If you switch to pay by invoice, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by check or wire transfer. To become eligible to pay for your Azure subscription by invoice, submit a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you can switch a subscription or billing profile to invoice pay in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).<br>

**Note:**

* Invoice pay is only available for business accounts, not personal accounts.
* The support team will review the account to determine if it is eligible for Invoice mode of payment.
* The support team will need a legal document to validate the legality of the company and its address such as a company registration form signed and issued by the government or any government issued documents having the company name and address (For example, a tax certification form).
* Your company address, tax ID, and bill-to address listed in your Azure Account properties must match the company’s information in the legal documents.
* If you intend to switch a current subscription to Invoice that contains Marketplace or 3rd party services, these services will need to be deleted before switching. For future Marketplace services, you are welcome to have a separate subscription using a credit card to make these purchases.
* You must pay all outstanding charges before switching to invoice pay.

# switch to pay by invoice

## **Recommended Steps**

If you switch to pay by invoice, that means you pay your bill within **30 days of the invoice date**. To become eligible to pay for your Azure subscription by invoice, submit a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you can switch a subscription to invoice pay in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).<br>
**Note:**

* Invoice pay is only available for business accounts, not personal accounts
* Support team will review the account to determine if it is eligible for Invoice mode of payment
* If you intend to switch a current subscription to Invoice that contains Marketplace or 3rd party services, these services will need to be deleted before switching. For future Marketplace services, you are welcome to have a separate subscription on credit card to make these purchases.
* You must pay all outstanding charges before switching to invoice pay.
* Once you switch to invoice pay, you can't switch back to credit or debit card payment.

### **Switch to invoice pay (check/wire transfer)**

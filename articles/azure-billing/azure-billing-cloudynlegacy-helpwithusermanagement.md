# Help with User Management

Access to Cloudyn data is provided by user or entity management. Cloudyn user accounts determine access to entities and administrative functions. There two types of access: admin and user. Admin access allows a user unrestricted use of all functions in the Cloudyn portal, including: user management, recipient lists management and root entity access to all entity data. User access is intended for end users to view reports and create reports using the access they have to entity data. <br>

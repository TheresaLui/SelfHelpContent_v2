# Request Invoices

## Recommended Steps

You can download your invoice or have it sent in email

**To download your invoice**

* Find out who's the account admin. If you're not sure who the account administrator is for a subscription, use the following steps to find out.<br>

	* Visit the [Subscriptions page in Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade).<br>
	* Select the subscription you want to check, and then look under Settings.<br>
	* Select Properties. The account administrator of the subscription is displayed in the Account Admin box.<br>
* The account admin can download a PDF invoice or CSV file of daily usage details. They can also configure additional recipients to receive copies of the PDF invoice over email [Download or view your billing invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#download-invoice-from-azure-portal-pdf) .<br>

**Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?** <br>

There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:

* You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a Free Trial. An invoice is only generated when you owe money.<br>

* It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.<br>

* The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.<br>

* If you're not the Account Administrator, older invoices may not be available to you.<br>

# Reservation billing and invoice

### **Billing for Reserved Instance purchase**

The reserved instance purchase is charged to the payment method tied to the subscription that you select at the time of purchase. The subscription type must be an enterprise agreement (offer number: MS-AZR-0017P), Pay-As-You-Go (offer number: MS-AZR-0003P), Microsoft Customer Agreement or CSP.

* For an enterprise subscription, the charges are deducted from the enrollment's monetary commitment balance or charged as overage
* For Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the charges are billed to the credit card or invoice payment method on the subscription
 
### **Download your invoice from Azure portal (.pdf)**

* Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) page in Azure portal as [a user with access to invoices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access)
* Select **Invoices**
* Click **Download Invoice** to view a copy of your PDF invoice. If it says **Not available**, see [Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#noinvoice)

### **Receive your invoice in email (.pdf)**

### **Unable to see invoice for the last billing period**
Some possible reasons you might not see an invoice:

* You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a Free Trial. An invoice is only generated when you owe money
* It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure
* The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period
* If you're not the Account Administrator, older invoices may not be available to you

# billing and payment issues

## **Recommended steps**

* If the subscription payment method is invoice (direct debit), please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) can review and update the credit card in the Account Center.<br>
[How to add, update or remove a credit or debit card for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)

* If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a *Past due balance notification* alert in the Account Center or Azure portal.<br>
[How to resolve past due balance for your Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance)

* You can download your invoice, or have it sent in email. However, only certain roles have permission to get billing invoice and usage information, like the Account Administrator.  To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access).<br>

* Learn more about how you can *prevent unexpected charges* with Azure billing and cost management [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-getting-started).<br>

* If youâ€™re the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) for an Azure subscription, you can also use the [Azure Billing Alert Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-set-up-alerts) to create customized billing alerts that help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts.<br>

* You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated. <br>

# billing and payment issues

## **Recommended steps**

* If the subscription payment method is invoice (direct debit), please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The Account Admin can review and update the credit card in the Account Center.<br>

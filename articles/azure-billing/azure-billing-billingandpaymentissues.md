# billing and payment issues

## **Recommended steps**
You may receive a past due balance email if payment has not been made or was declined by your bank. To resolve the issue, follow these steps.

1. If the subscription payment method is invoice (direct debit), please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.
2. The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The Account Admin can review & update the credit card in the Azure Account Center.<br>
[Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions)
3. To determine the 'Account Administrator' of your subscription - click on 'Subscriptions' on the left pane in Azure portal, select your subscription, click 'Settings', select 'Properties' and scroll down on the properties blade to view the Account Admin's email address.
4. Learn more about  Azure Administrator roles.<br>

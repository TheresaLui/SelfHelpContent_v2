# Supported payment instruments and currencies

### **Changing your billing currency or country**

The billing country, once set, can’t be changed. In order to update the billing country, a new account can be created with a new email address and the desired billing country. After the new account has been created, you can transfer your subscriptions and resources from the old account to the new account.

To view the list of support currencies, go to [Azure pricing FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/faq/) and find the section,"Azure is available in the following countries/regions and is billed in the currency noted."

### **Re-enable the subscription**

Your subscription might be disabled if the monthly credits on your subscription are used up. It will be re-activated when the credits are set back in the next billing cycle. If your subscription is disabled, check:

- If your payment method associated with the subscription of billing profile is expired
- If the credit or debit card is expired.
- The subscription could be past due because of failed charges. Update the payment method, then try to [resolve past due balances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/resolve-past-due-balance?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) and [pay your bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/pay-bill).
- If you have spending limit enabled or if you have deployed any third-party services. If so, remove the spending limit or delete/remove the service. After the spending limit is removed, clear browser cache, cookies or use in-private browser to login to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to verify the subscription status, or wait until the next billing cycle when new credits would be added and the subscription would be automatically enabled.

For more information on how to reactivate a subscription see [Reactivate a disabled Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled).

### **Payment options for Azure Purchase**

-	You can purchase Azure using a **credit card** or a **debit card**. Please note that we do not accept prepaid and virtual credit cards.
-	The other payment option is to pay by [invoice (Pay by check or wire transfer)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/pay-by-invoice?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). Once you opt for the invoice option, you cannot move to the credit card option.

**Payments with credit/debit card**

-	In order to be able to make immediate payment, make sure to [resolve past due balances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/resolve-past-due-balance?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) and [pay your bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/pay-bill). If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a Past due balance notification alert in the Azure portal.
-	The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/account-admin-tasks) or someone with the appropriate [MCA permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-mca-roles) can review and update the credit card. See [Add/Update my payment method to learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).
-	You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator or someone with [MCA permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-mca-roles). Follow this article on how to get your subscription reactivated: [Reactivate my subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).
-	If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your financial institution, please reach out to your financial institution to resolve the issue and keep in mind:
    -  You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card.
	  -  If card has credit limit to settle the balance.
  	-  If recurring payment is enabled on the card.

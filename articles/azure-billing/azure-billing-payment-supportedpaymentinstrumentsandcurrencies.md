### **Payment options for Azure Purchase**

* You can purchase Azure using a **credit card** or a **debit card**. Please note that we do not accept prepaid and virtual credit cards. There may be a delay before discounts are reflected on your bill. You are solely responsible for any credit card interest or other credit card charges that may result.
* The other payment option is to be [**invoiced**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-pay-by-invoice). Once you opt for the invoice option, you cannot move to the credit card option. 
* Review the list of [Supported countries/regions and currencies](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/faq/)

# Unexpected Charges-free trial

* The Azure Free Account offer includes $200 of Azure credits (to be used within the first 30 days of sign-up) and 12 months of select free services (subject to change)
* This offer is limited to one enrollment per eligible customer and cannot be combined with any other offer unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft
* Within 30 days of sign-up or upon exhaustion of the customer’s credits (whichever occurs first), the customer must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account by removing the Spending Limit. This allows continued use of the Azure Free Account for the remaining 11 months. After the customer has upgraded, usage outside the initial credits and select free services will be billed at Pay-As-You-Go rates. If the customer elects not to upgrade, the Free Account subscription will be disabled.<br>

* Once you re-enable and convert your Free trial subscription to PAYG free Included Services should start from the time the subscription is enabled. Additionally, if you convert you Azure Free Account to X offer (other than PAYG) by mistake, you will still continue to receive the benefits.

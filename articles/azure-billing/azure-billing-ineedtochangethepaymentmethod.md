# I need to change the payment method

## **Recommended steps**

1. [Find out who's the Account Admin](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade).

2. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Admin.

3. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to change payment method.

4. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.

If you want to update payment method to 'invoice' (direct debit), please open a support request so we can run a credit check before approving your request.

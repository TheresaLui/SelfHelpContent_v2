# I need to change the payment method

## **Recommended steps**

1. [Find out who's the Account Admin](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade).

2. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa).

3. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to change payment method.

4. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.

If you want to update payment method to 'invoice' (direct debit), please open a [support request](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) so we can run a credit check before approving your request.

5. If you get an error after you add the credit card, see [Credit card declined at Azure sign-up](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4042960/troubleshoot-why-your-debit-card-or-credit-card-is-declined-at-azure-s)

# I need to change the payment method

## **Recommended steps**

The Account Admin can add, update, or remove the payment information through the Azure Account Center.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to change payment method.

3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.

To determine the **Account Administrator** of your subscription - select **Properties** on the left and scroll down to view the Account Admin's email address. <br>

If you want to update payment method to 'invoice' (direct debit), please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) so we can run a credit check before approving your request.

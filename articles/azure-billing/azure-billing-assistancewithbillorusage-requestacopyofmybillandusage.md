### **Unable to see invoice for the last billing period**

Some possible reasons you might not see an invoice:

  * You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a Free Trial. An invoice is only generated when you owe money
  * It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure
  * The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period
  * If you're not the Account Administrator, older invoices may not be available to you

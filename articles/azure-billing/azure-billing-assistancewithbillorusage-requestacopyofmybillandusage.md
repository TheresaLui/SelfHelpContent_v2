# request a copy of my bill and usage

## **Recommended Steps**

You can download your invoice or have it sent in email <br>

### To download your invoice from Azure portal (.pdf)

  1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal as [a user with access to invoices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access).
  2. Select **Invoices**.
  3. Click **Download Invoice** to view a copy of your PDF invoice. If it says **Not available**, see [Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#noinvoice)

### To get your invoice in email (.pdf)

  1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade).  Click **Invoices** then Email my invoice.
  2. Click **opt in** and accept the terms. You will have to opt in for each subscription you own
_Note:_ If you don't get an email after following the steps, make sure your email address is correct in the [communication preferences on your profile](https://account.windowsazure.com/profile).

### To download your usage from the Account Center(.csv)
  
  1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)
  2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information
  3. Select **Billing History**
  4. Select **View Current Statement** to see an estimate of your charges at the time the estimate was generated.
  5. Select **Download Usage** to download the daily usage data as a CSV file. If you see two versions available, download version 2.

For more information about your daily usage, see [Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill). For help managing costs, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-getting-started) <br>

Instead of [downloading your invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date) every month, you can now opt-in to receive your invoice statement attached to your monthly billing email : [Azure invoices emailed direct to your inbox](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-email-invoices/) <br>

### Unable to see invoice for the last billing period

Some possible reasons you might not see an invoice :

  * You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a Free Trial. An invoice is only generated when you owe money.
  * It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.
  * The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.
  * If you're not the Account Administrator, older invoices may not be available to you.

2. Click **opt in** and accept the terms. You will have to opt in for each subscription you own. Note: If you don't get an email after following the steps, make sure your email address is correct in the [communication preferences on your profile](https://account.windowsazure.com/profile).<br>

### **Download your usage from the Account Center(.csv)**

1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)

* Manage costs: [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-getting-started)<br>

### **Unable to see invoice for the last billing period**

Some possible reasons you might not see an invoice:

  * You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a Free Trial. An invoice is only generated when you owe money.
  * It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure
  * The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.
  * If you're not the Account Administrator, older invoices may not be available to you<br>

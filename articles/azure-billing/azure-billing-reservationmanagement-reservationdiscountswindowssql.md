# Reserved Instance- How am I billed for Windows and SQL when reservation discounts is applied?

* Reserved VM instance and SQL reserved capacity applies only to the compute usage and not to the Windows or SQL IP usage
* If you use Windows VM and don't have an Azure Hybrid Benefit on your reserved virtual machine instances, then you are charged for the software meters listed in this doc: [Software costs not included with Azure Reserved VM Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-reserved-instance-windows-software-costs)
* For SQL PaaS or IaaS deployments, the IP cost will continue to be charged using separate meter if Azure Hybrid Benefit is not selected

### **Troubleshoot Payment issues**
Refer [Troubleshoot payment issues/error scenarios](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4505172/troubleshooting-payment-issues) to see if it resolves your issue.

### **Change/Update/Remove existing payment method**

* In order to be able to make immediate payment, please make sure to [resolve past due balances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance). If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a Past due balance notification alert in the Account Center or Azure portal
* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) can review and update the credit card in the Account Center: [Add/Update my payment method](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated: [Reactivate my subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)
* If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your financial institution, please reach out to your **financial institution** to resolve the issue. Use the below pointers

	* You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card<br>
	* If card has credit limit to settle the balance<br>
	* If recurring payment is enabled on the card<br>
* **Declined payment**: Please make sure which payment instrument (PI) is getting declined incase you have multiple PI's associated to a subscription. If needed, change the PI by following the steps here: [How to change your credit card](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* **Remove card**: If you need to remove your PI from the subscription, please follow the steps here: [Remove your credit card from the account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#remove-a-credit-card-from-the-account)<br>

### **Switch to Pay by Invoice**
If you want to update payment method to 'invoice' (direct debit), please open a [support request](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) so we can run a credit check before approving your request. Refer [Switch to Pay by Invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-pay-by-invoice) to change to invoice mode of payment<br>

Check the [Payment FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#frequently-asked-questions) to see if it resolves your issue

### **Stop email notifications from Azure**

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)<br>
2. Click **opt out of emailed invoices**. This option removes any email addresses set to receive invoices in email. If you opt back in, you will have to reconfigure recipients

### **Billing Alerts**

* If you’re the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) for an Azure subscription, you can use the [Azure Billing Alert Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-set-up-alerts) to create customized billing alerts that help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts
* You can also download your invoice, or have it sent in email. However, only certain roles have permission to get billing invoice and usage information, like the Account Administrator<br>

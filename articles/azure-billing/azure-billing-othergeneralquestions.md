# General questions about your Azure invoice

## **Recommended Steps**

* To [understand your Azure bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill), compare your invoice with the detailed daily usage file and the cost management reports in the Azure portal

### **Understanding terms on your Azure invoice**

The invoice provides a summary of your charges and provides instructions for payment. However, please note:

* If you're using a free trial subscription, you can get your detailed usage information from the Azure portal but you will not have an invoice
* Up to 24 hours of usage at the end of the previous billing period may show up in your current invoice
* Charges listed on billing statements for international customers are for estimation purposes only. Banks may have different costs for the conversion rates.

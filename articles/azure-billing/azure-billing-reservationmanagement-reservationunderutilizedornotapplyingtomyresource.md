# Reserved Instance -reservation underutilized or not applying to my resource

### **What to do if my reservation is underutilized?**

After purchasing a reservation, wait for up to two days to get stable usage trend for the reservation. If you continue to see lower than expected utilization try following:

* Make sure that the SKU selected for the reservation matches the deployed resource. For VMs, a reservation purchased for premium disk VM sizes will not apply to non-premium disk VMs, and vice-versa. Example: D series RI will not apply to DS series VM. Click on exchange button above to change the VM size.
* For reservations scoped to a single subscription or resource group, changing the scope can increase usage. You can [change the reservation scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-reserved-vm-instance#change-the-reservation-scope) to shared scope or a different subscription or resource group to increase the utilization. You can also [split most reservation types](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-reserved-vm-instance#split-a-single-reservation-into-two-reservations) and apply them to different scopes.
* For Virtual machine, if instance size flexibility is off, [switching it to 'on'](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-reserved-vm-instance#change-optimize-setting-for-reserved-vm-instances) can potentially increase usage. Change reservation configuration.
* You can exchange the reservation to suit your changing needs. You can do a partial exchange, i.e. exchange only some of the VMs that you had purchased in the order.

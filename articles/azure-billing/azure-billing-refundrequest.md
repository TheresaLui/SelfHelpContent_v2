# Refund Request

## **Recommended Steps**

You can request a refund  by submitting a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you will be provided with the requested refund amount. Please use this path for **Non-EA customers, Customers with Azure EA agreement (direct customers and partners only)**

**Customers with Azure EA agreement (indirect)**
If you are an Indirect EA customer, please log your request for pricing, billing, and credit scenarios via **EA portal** only.

### **Information needed to process the refund request quickly**

* Refund amount
* Reason for the refund
* New Refund request or checking the status of an existing refund request

### **Reserved Instance Refunds**
To request refunds for your reserved instance, please select:

* Issue type: **Billing**
* Select the Subscription for which you want the refund for
* Problem Type: **Manage reserved instance**
* Problem subtype: **Cancel, exchange and refunds**
* Additionally provide: Reservation ID, Reservation Order ID and reason for return/exchange

### **Policy**

* Credits or refunds are always applied at the Subscription level as opposed to the Account level
* Microsoft can only credit or refund the charges we invoiced for, and only in the currency you were charged in
* Credit Cards: If we are providing a refund to a credit card, we can only refund the card you were initially charged
* If you incurred other charges by other institutions (such as your bank or due to currency conversion), Microsoft is unable to refund these charges

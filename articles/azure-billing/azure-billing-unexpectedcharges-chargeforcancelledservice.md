* The anniversary day is the day of the month you purchased the subscription. The invoice is generated on the anniversary date and 10 days later the credit card is charged. Invoice customers need to pay using Wire transfer/check and the details for payment is available on your monthly invoice.<br>

* For example, if you purchased the subscription on January 15th, the anniversary day will be the 15th of each month when the invoice is generated and 10 days later the card is charged

**Note**: If you cancel your subscription/resource in the middle of your billing cycle, you might still see a charge which would be for any usage in the previous month. For example, if your billing cycle was from the 26th of every month to the 25th of the next month & you suspended the subscription on the 23rd, which is 28 days into the billing cycle for June, you might see a charge for the 28 days of use.<br>
If you see a charge despite of cancelling a subscription please make sure you don’t have any other support plans which is causing the charge. If you do, please go ahead and cancel the plan.<br>

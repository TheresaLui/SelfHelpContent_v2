# Exchanges and refunds for an Azure Reserved Instance

### **Purchase a Reserved Instance**

To buy a reservation, you must have a subscription owner role in an Enterprise (MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P) or Pay-As-You-Go subscription (MS-AZR-003P or MS-AZR-0023P). Cloud solution providers can use the Azure portal or [Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-reservations) to purchase Azure Reservations.<br>
Learn more, see [Azure Reservations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-save-compute-costs-reservations)

### **Exchange an existing reserved instance (Self-service)**

You can exchange a reservation for another reservation of the same type. You can also refund a reservation, up to $50,000 USD per year, if you no longer need it. Self-service exchange and cancel capability isn't available for US Government Enterprise Agreement customers. Other US Government subscription types including Pay-As-You-Go and CSP are supported. You must have owner access on the Reservation Order to exchange or refund an existing reservation

  2. Select the VM product that you want to purchase and type a quantity.

# make immediate payment

### **Invoice Payments**

For Invoice (direct debit) payments, please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

### **Payments with credit/debit card**

* In order to be able to make immediate payment, please make sure to [resolve past due balances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance). If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a Past due balance notification alert in the Account Center or Azure portal
* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) can review and update the credit card in the Account Center: [Add/Update my payment method](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated: [Reactivate my subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)
* If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your financial institution, please reach out to your **financial institution** to resolve the issue. Use the below pointers

	* You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card<br>
	* If card has credit limit to settle the balance<br>
	* If recurring payment is enabled on the card<br>
* **Declined payment**: Please make sure which payment instrument (PI) is getting declined incase you have multiple PI's associated to a subscription. If needed, change the PI by following the steps here: [How to change your credit card](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* **Remove card**: If you need to remove your PI from the subscription, please follow the steps here: [Remove your credit card from the account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#remove-a-credit-card-from-the-account)<br>

Check the [Payment FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#frequently-asked-questions) to see if it resolves your issue <br>

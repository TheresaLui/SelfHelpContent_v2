# make immediate payment

### **Invoice Payments**

For Invoice (direct debit) payments, please send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.

### **Payments with credit/debit card**

* If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a Past due balance notification alert in the Account Center or Azure portal: [How to resolve past due balance for your Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance)
* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) can review and update the credit card in the Account Center: [How to add, update or remove a credit or debit card for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated: [Why is my Azure subscription disabled and how do I reactivate it?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)

Check the [Payment FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#frequently-asked-questions) to see if it resolves your issue <br>

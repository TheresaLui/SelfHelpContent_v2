# Cost Management - cost data issues

**How do I see the cost of each resource I’m using?**<br>
Cost analysis offers 4 built-in views to serve as a starting point for you to analyze costs. Open the view menu (between the scope and date pills) to reveal a list of all saved, shared, and built-in views.  Use the **Cost by resource** see costs broken down by each resource, sorted from most to least expensive within the date range (defaults to the current billing period). To see the individual meters for a specific resource, apply a resource filter and group by meter.<br>

**Tags I have set on resources are missing from Cost Management, can you explain why?**<br> 
Most taggable Azure services, emit tags to the Cost Management platform. However, a few services are yet to complete this work.  The following services don’t emit tags yet to the Cost Management platform:
* Azure Networking - VPN Gateway
* Azure ExpressRoute
* Azure Eventgrid
* Azure Firewall
* Azure Databricks
* Notification Hub
* Azure Subscriptions (Tag at sub level)
* Azure Compute | Disk Resource Provider (RP)
* Azure DataFactory
* Azure AppServices 
 
This is work in progress and we will update this list if any change occurs.<br>

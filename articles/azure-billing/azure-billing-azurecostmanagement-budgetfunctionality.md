# Budget functionality
Budgets in Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the Azure services you consume or subscribe to during a specific period. Also, budgets reset automatically at the end of a period (monthly, quarterly, or annually) for the same amount.

## **Recommended steps**

You can download your invoice or have it sent in email<br>

**To download your invoice**

2. The Account Admin can download PDF invoice and CSV usage, or configure to get PDF invoice over email.<br>
[Download or view your billing invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date)

**To download your usage from the Account Center(.csv)**
1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)

2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information

3. Select **Billing History**

4. Select **View Current Statement** to see an estimate of your charges at the time the estimate was generated.

5. Select **Download Usage** to download the daily usage data as a CSV file. If you see two versions available, download version 2.

For more information about your daily usage, see [Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill). For help managing costs, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-getting-started)

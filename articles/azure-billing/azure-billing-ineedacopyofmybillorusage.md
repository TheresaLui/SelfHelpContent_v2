# How do I retrieve a copy of my Azure Subscription bill or review usage?

## **Recommended Steps**

You can download your invoice, or have it sent via email.

### Download your invoice

1. [Find your Account Administrator](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade)
2. The Account Admin can [download or view the PDF invoice and CSV usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date)

### Download your usage from the Account Center(.csv)

1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)
2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information
3. Select **Billing History**
4. Select **View Current Statement** to see an estimate of your charges at the time the estimate was generated
5. Select **Download Usage** to download the daily usage data as a CSV file. If you see two versions available, download version 2.

For more information about your daily usage, see [Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill). For help managing costs, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-getting-started).

Instead of [downloading your invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date) every month, you can now opt-in to receive your invoice statement attached to your monthly billing email.

# Reserved Instance- Unable to purchase or questions before purchase

### **Unable to purchase **

You can purchase reserved instances from [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/CreateBlade/referrer/Support_Solutions)

### **Troubleshoot purchase issues**

Please use following points to troubleshoot if you are running into issues while trying to purchase:

* You need a **Pay-As-You-Go** (3P) or **Enterprise Agreement** (17P) or Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription to purchase a reserved instance. Other subscriptions such as Azure in Open, Free Trial, MSDN, MPN, etc. **are not** eligible for RI purchase
* You _must_ have **owner** role on the subscription to buy a Reserved Instance.
* **Enterprise Agreement** billing admins can restrict the reservation purchase from EA portal. Ask your EA Admin if you’re still not able to purchase a reservation even though above conditions are met. You don’t need your partner to place the order for you.
* **Country restrictions**: Reserved Instance for Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions (03P) is **not** available in the following countries: Brazil, India, China, Taiwan, Russia, Korea, Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia,  Liechtenstein,  Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey. Please [up vote this feature request](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/170030-signup-and-billing/suggestions/37898131-make-reserved-instances-available-to-payg-subscrib). Refer [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/) to learn more.
* If you see a **credit card failure**, please verify if You have sufficient funds and you are using a valid payment instrument. Contact your bank if payment is declined.
* **CSP** customers can only purchase reservations through their partners. Partners can use Partner Center Portal or Azure portal for RI purchase.

### **Questions before purchase**

* **Which VM size should I buy?**<br>
Read this article: [Determine the right VM size before you buy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/prepay-reserved-vm-instances?toc=/azure/billing/TOC.json#determine-the-right-vm-size-before-you-buy)

* **Questions on how to buy SQL reserved capacity?**<br>
Read this article: [Buy SQL Database reserved capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-reserved-capacity?toc=/azure/billing/TOC.json#buy-sql-database-reserved-capacity)

* **I am in Indirect EA customer, do I need my partner to purchase?**<br>
No, you can purchase the RI if you an owner on an EA subscription.

* **Does RI purchase deduct from monetary commitment?**<br>
Yes. If you don’t have enough monetary commitment, you will get an overage invoice for the amount that exceeds the available monetary commitment.

* **How does reserved instance apply to Windows VMs or to my SQL IP costs?**<br>
The reserved instance discount only applies to the compute usage. Windows IP or SQL IP costs will be charged separately and don’t get RI discount.

# Change update payment method

## **Recommended Steps**

In the Azure portal you can add a new payment method, update an existing payment method, or delete an existing payment method. First you will have to verify your account type.

### **Check the type of your account**

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**
1. Select **Properties** from the left-hand side. The **Type** field on the properties page determines the type of your account. It can be:
   - Microsoft Online Service Program
   - Microsoft Customer Agreement
   - Microsoft Partner Agreement
   - Enterprise Agreement

For more detailed instruction on how to check the type of account see [Check the type of your account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/view-all-accounts#check-the-type-of-your-account).

### **Microsoft Online Service Program**

**Add a new Credit or Debit card to an Azure subscription**

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**.
2. Select a Subscription you'd like to add the credit or debit card to. Select **Payment methods**.
3. In the top-left corner, select **+** to add a card. Follow the prompts.
4. To make this card your active payment method, check the box next to **Make this my active payment method** above the form. This card will become the active payment instrument for all subscriptions using the same card as the selected subscription. Select **Next**.

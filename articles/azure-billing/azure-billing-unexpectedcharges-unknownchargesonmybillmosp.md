**Note**: If you cancel your subscription/resource in the middle of your billing cycle, you might still see a charge which would be for any usage in the previous month. Example, if your billing cycle was from the 26th of every month to the 25th of the next month & you suspended the subscription on the 23rd, which is 28 days into the billing cycle for June, you might see a charge for the 28 days of use. If you see a charge in spite of cancelling a subscription please make sure, you don’t have any other support plans which is causing the charge. If you do, please go ahead and cancel the plan.

**Azure Bizspark Subscription**: A BizSpark subscription had a validity of 2 years. Once the validity of the subscription ends, it is converted to Pay-As-You-Go subscription. Learn more: [Azure Bizspark subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0064p/)

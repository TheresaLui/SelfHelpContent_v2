# Help me with azure calculator

## **Recommended Steps**

You can configure and estimate the costs for Azure products using: [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)

### **Azure Calculator FAQ:**

* **How do I change the currency for my estimate?**<br>
After you configure your services, scroll down to the bottom of the page and use the drop-down menu to change the currency. The prices will immediately reflect the currency you choose<br>

* **How do I save my estimate?**<br>
After you configure your estimate, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Save**. (If you aren’t signed in, you’ll be prompted to do so.) Your estimate is now saved to the account you signed in with and can be found on the **Estimates** tab at the top of the page. Retrieve your estimate from any computer by simply signing in using the same credentials.

* **How do I share my estimate?**<br>
To share your estimate with other users, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Share**. (If you aren’t signed in, you’ll be prompted to do so.) You’ll receive a unique URL, which you can share with others over IM or email. When others select the link, they’ll see the estimate that you configured.

* **How do CSPs view the estimate with the Cloud Solution Provider licensing program option?**<br>
If your organization is a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you have an account on the partner center portal, view the estimate with the CSP licensing program option selected. Sign in using the same credentials that you use for the partner center and then configure your estimate. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and change the drop-down **Licensing Program** to **CSP**. The page will refresh to show you the estimate with the CSP licensing program.

* **I have an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft. How do I view the estimate with the Enterprise Agreement licensing program option?**<br>
If your organization has an Enterprise Agreement (EA), view the estimate with the EA licensing program option selected. This feature is available for EA Admins, Department Admins (DA), and Account Owners (AO). The View Charges setting needs to be enabled for DA and AO roles. Users who have access to a subscription of the EA (i.e. owner, contributor, reader roles) will also be able to see the EA prices in the calculator. Sign in using your EA credentials and then configure your estimate. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and change the drop-down Licensing Program to Enterprise Agreement. Select the enrollment and click apply. The page will refresh to show you the estimate with the Enterprise Agreement licensing program.

* **I have a Microsoft Customer Agreement with Microsoft. How do I view the estimate with the Microsoft Customer Agreement licensing program option?**<br>
If your organization has a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you may view pricing estimate pertaining to your agreement. Sign in to the calculator using your credentials which has access to Microsoft Customer Agreement and then configure your estimate. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select Microsoft Customer Agreement in the drop-down under Licensing Program. Select the Billing Account and then Billing Profile and click apply. The page will refresh to show you the pricing estimate with a Microsoft Customer Agreement.

* **How do I view the SKU and Resource ID for the services I configured in my estimate?**<br>
Sign in and scroll down to the bottom of the page. You’ll see options for displaying the SKU and Resource ID. After you turn these on, the SKU and Resource ID should be displayed. If you don’t see them after a few seconds, try signing out and then signing in again.

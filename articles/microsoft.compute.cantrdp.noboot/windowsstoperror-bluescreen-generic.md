# VM boot error: Generic Blue Screen
<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and determined that your virtual machine (VM) <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> is in an inaccessible state. This may be due to many reasons, such as a corrupted system file or memory, driver issues, or an application a forbidden sector of the memory.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Use the [Boot Diagnostics Screenshot](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.SerialConsoleLogBladeViewModel.resourceId.$resourceId;data-blade-uri:{$domain}/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/{$resourceIdDecoded}/bootDiagnostics) to see the current state of your VM. For this issue, the screenshot would be a blue screen with the error code **Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart**. It may additionally state that **We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you**. This may also help you diagnose future issues and determine if a boot error is the cause.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

* To restore access to the VM, follow the steps in the [Windows shows blue screen error when booting an Azure VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-common-blue-screen-error) troubleshooting guide

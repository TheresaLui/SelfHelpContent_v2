# VM boot error: #0x00000067 Configuration Initialization Failed
<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and determined that your virtual machine (VM) <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> is in an inaccessible state because Windows failed to boot with error code #0x00000067 'Config Initialization Failed'. This issue occurs when the Initial Machine Configuration (IMC) reference is setup on the Boot loader, but its reference is missing in the registry.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Use the [Boot Diagnostics Screenshot](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.SerialConsoleLogBladeViewModel.resourceId.$resourceId;data-blade-uri:{$domain}/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/{$resourceIdDecoded}/bootDiagnostics) to see the current state of your VM. For this issue, the screenshot would show the message **Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart** with the error code **CONFIG INITIALIZATION FAILED** or code **0x00000067**. This may also help you diagnose future issues and determine if a boot error is the cause.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

1. <a name="prepvm"><a/>Use [steps 1-3 of the VM Repair Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands#repair-process-example) to prepare a Repair VM. Once prepared, use Remote Desktop Connection connect to the Repair VM.

2. Identify the Boot partition and the System partition. You can use **Disk Management** in the **Computer Management** tool (located in Windows Administrative Tools) to assist you.

    * The Boot partition can be determined by looking in the Status column for the descriptor "boot". This partition is typically the largest partition and is usually assigned "C:" as its identifier.

    * The System partition is often labeled "System Reserved" and its files are hidden by default. The System partition is small, typically about 300 MB-500 MB in size. It contains the Boot Manager and Boot Configuration Data.

    * If there's only one partition on the OS disk, this partition is both the Boot partition and the System partition.

3. Open an elevated command prompt (run as administrator) and gather the current booting setup info using the `bcdedit /store <DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /enum` command.

    > Replace `<DRIVE LETTER>` with the appropriate letter of your drive.

    * Here's an example of the output:

        ```
        c:\> bcdedit /store <DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /enum
        Windows Boot Manager
        --------------------
        identifier              {bootmgr}
        device                  unknown
        description             Windows Boot Manager
        locale                  en-us
        inherit                 {globalsettings}
        displayorder            {current}
        toolsdisplayorder       {memdiag}
        timeout                 30

        Windows Boot Loader
        -------------------
        identifier              {<IDENTIFIER>}
        device                  boot
        path                    \Windows\system32\winload.exe
        description             Windows Server 2016
        locale                  en-US
        inherit                 {bootloadersettings}
        recoverysequence        {821346ba-615b-11e7-a81b-000d3a23c6df}
        recoveryenabled         No
        osdevice                boot
        imcdevice               locate=\IMC.hiv
        systemroot              \Windows
        imchivename             \IMC.hiv
        resumeobject            {e6df4561-50ce-11e7-a810-806e6f6e6963}
        nx                      OptOut
        bootstatuspolicy        IgnoreAllFailures

        ```

4. In the Windows Boot Loader information displayed, notice the references **imcdevice** and **imchivename**. You will need to delete those references with the following commands:

        bcdedit /store <DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /deletevalue {<IDENTIFIER>} imcdevice
        bcdedit /store <DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /deletevalue {<IDENTIFIER>} imchivename

    > Replace any `<TEXT HERE>` with the appropriate information indicated.

    > "Drive Letter" is the boot partition that contains a hidden system folder named "Boot".

    > "Identifier" is the identifier of Windows Boot Loader you found in the previous step.

5. Use [step 5 of the VM Repair Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands#repair-process-example) to reassemble the VM. Once reassembled, test if the VM is responding to RDP connectivity to see if this has fixed the issue.

6. If the issue persists, repeat [step 1 to create a new repair VM and then connect to it](#prepvm). Once the VM is prepared, open an elevated command prompt (run as administrator) and continue with the next steps.

7. Check which ControlSet the machine is booting from. You will see its key number in the `HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\Select\Current` directory. Once located, just make the changes on the registry keys on that branch. See example below where the disk is drive F:.

        reg load HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM f:\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM
    
        reg query "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\Select" /v Current

    > If your disk isn't drive F:, update the letter to match your situation.

8. Run the following commands to create the property *ErrorControlPolicy* on the IMC keys:

    1. Get the current ControlSet from where the OS is booting:

            for /f "tokens=3" %x in ('reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\Select /v Current') do set ControlSet=%x
            set ControlSet=%ControlSet:~2,1%
        
    2. Create the IMC property:

            set key=HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet00%ControlSet%\Control\InitialMachineConfig\_Global
            reg add %key% /v ErrorControlPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
            set key=HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet00%ControlSet%\Control\InitialMachineConfig\System
            reg add %key% /v ErrorControlPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

    3. Unload BROKENSYSTEM:
        
            reg unload HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM

9. Use [step 5 of the VM Repair Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands#repair-process-example) to reassemble the VM. Once reassembled, test if the VM is responding to RDP connectivity.

# VM Boot Error

<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and determined that your virtual machine is in an inaccessible state because we could not find an operation system.

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Force a restart of the Virtual Machine from the portal


 



2. If this is a recurrent issue on every restart causing a slow shutdown operation, then collect a memory dump while the problem is happening and create a support case providing the memory dump collected.

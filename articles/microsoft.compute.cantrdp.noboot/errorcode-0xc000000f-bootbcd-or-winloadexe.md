# VM boot error
<!--issueDescription-->

Microsoft Azure has concluded an investigation of your Virtual Machine (VM) <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that your VM is currently in an inaccessible state because windows failed to boot with error code **0xc000000f**. This issue occurs when a device that doesn't exist is specified in the Boot Configuration data.

If you find that you cannot connect to a VM in the future, you can view a screenshot of your VM using the boot diagnostics blade in the Azure Portal. This may help you diagnose the issue and determine if a similar boot error is the cause.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Stop the VM and create a snapshot](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/tree/master/VMRecovery/ResourceManager)
2. Run [New-AzureRMRescueVM.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/blob/master/VMRecovery/ResourceManager/New-AzureRMRescueVM.ps1)
3. Verify the OS partition that holds the BCD store for the disk is marked as active:

    1. Open an elevated command prompt and open `diskpart` 
    2. List the disks on the system with `list disk`, check for added disks, and use `sel disk 1` to select the new disk
    3. List all the partitions on the disk using `list partition` and select the partition to check with `sel <PARTITION ID>`. Typically, System Managed partitions are around 350Mb in size. 
    4. Check the status of the partition to verify that it's Active using `detail partition`
    5. Check for the "Active" flag. If the partition is not active, change the state with `active`
    6. To validate the changes where done properly, re-run `detail partition`. Type `Exit` when ready.

 4. Identify the Boot partition and the Windows partition. If there's only one partition on the OS disk, this partition is both the Boot partition and the Windows partition. The Windows partition contains a folder named "Windows," and this partition is larger than the others. The Boot partition contains a folder named "Boot." This folder is hidden by default. To see the folder, you must display the hidden files and folders and disable the Hide protected operating system files (Recommended) option. The boot partition is typically 300 MB~500 MB.

    1. As administrator, run `bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /enum` and copy the Windows Boot Loader identifier. The identifier is a 32-character code in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. 
    2. Repair the Boot Configuration data by running the following command lines, using actual values. "Windows partition" is the partition that contains a folder named "Windows, "Boot partition" is the partition that contains a hidden system folder named "Boot, and "Identifier" is the identifier of Windows Boot Loader you found in the previous step:

```
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} device partition=[boot partition]:
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {[Identifier]} device partition=[Windows partition]:
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {[Identifier]} integrityservices enable
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {[identifier]} recoveryenabled Off
bcdedit /store [Boot partition]:\boot\bcd /set {[identifier]} osdevice partition=[Windows partition]:
bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
```

5. [Run Restore-AzureRMOriginalVM.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/tree/master/VMRecovery/ResourceManager). When it will create a PowerShell script, Restore_.ps1, that you will run later to swap the problem VM's OS disk back to the problem VM.

# VM boot error
<!--issueDescription-->
## **Boot error found for your virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->:**
Microsoft Azure has concluded an investigation of your Virtual Machine (VM) <!--$vmname-->**[vmname]**<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that your VM is currently in an inaccessible state as it is in a reboot loop with an error code **0xC00002e3**. The issue occurs when the SAM registry hive is missing or corrupt.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To fix the issue, either replace the file from the C:\windows\WinSxS folder on the same machine or from another working VM with the same OS and Patch level as this machine following these troubleshooting steps.

1. Please make a note of the File name and the path from the screenshot.
2. Delete the virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. Make sure that you select the Keep the disks option when you do this.
3. Before proceeding further save a copy of the OS disk, this will help in case of a rollback for recovery, see [Create a copy of a specialized Windows VM running in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-vhd-copy)
4. Attach the OS disk of the deleted VM <!--($vmname)--> as a data disk to another VM (a troubleshooting VM). For more information, see [How to attach a data disk to a Windows VM in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-attach-disk-portal).
5. Connect to the troubleshooting VM to ensure the newly attached OS disk is online and has a drive letter assigned.
6. Identify the Boot partition and the Windows partition. If there's only one partition on the OS disk, this partition is the Boot partition and the Windows partition.
  * The Windows partition contains a folder named "Windows," and this partition is larger than the others.
  * The Boot partition contains a folder named "Boot." This folder is hidden by default. To see the folder, you must display the hidden files and folders and disable the Hide protected operating system files (Recommended) option. The boot partition is typically 300 MB~500 MB
7. Browse up to the folder \windows\system32\config and check if the file SAM exist, if it does rename it to SAM.CORRUPT.
8. In case you have a backup of the Disk or a System backup taken before the VM ran into this issue, please check if SAM file exists in \windows\system32\config.
9. If SAM file exists in the backup, replace/copy the file to the affected machineâ€™s OS Disk \windows\system32\config folder.
10. In cases there are no backups, on the affected disk copy the file from \windows\system32\config\regback\SAM to \windows\system32\config\.
11. Detach the repaired OS disk from the troubleshooting VM. [Then, create a new VM from the OS disk](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-create-vm-specialized)

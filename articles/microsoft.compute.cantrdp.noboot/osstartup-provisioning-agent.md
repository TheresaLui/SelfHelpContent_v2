# VM boot error: Provisioning Agent
<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and determined that your virtual machine (VM) <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> is in an inaccessible state because SYSPREP was ran on this VM and then the VM was restarted without performing a proper post-provisioning cleanup. ErrorHandler.cmd is part of the IaaS provisioning agent, which should only run when a VM is first provisioned from a generalized image. The cleanup process is responsible for removing the unattend.wsf answer file as well as  unmounting the ISO from the CD-ROM. Since this wasn't performed, it triggers the provisioning agent and remains stuck during setup.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Use the [Boot Diagnostics Screenshot](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.SerialConsoleLogBladeViewModel.resourceId.$resourceId;data-blade-uri:{$domain}/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/{$resourceIdDecoded}/bootDiagnostics) to see the current state of your VM. For this issue, the screenshot would reflect the error code **â€‹Administrator: ERROR HANDLER**. This may also help you diagnose future issues and determine if a boot error is the cause.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

* At this stage the VM is broken. You either need to restore it from backup or to download the VHD and manually finish the out-of-box-experience wizard.

* See recommended documents below for assistance in properly preparing a VHD for upload, generalizing a VM using SYSPREP, or creating a VM from a generalized image.

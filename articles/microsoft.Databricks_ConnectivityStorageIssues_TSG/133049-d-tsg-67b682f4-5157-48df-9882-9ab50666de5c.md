# Connection timed out with Metastore client

### Symptom

Connection timed out with Metastore client getting error(s):

`java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Could not connect to address=(host=consolidated-centralus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com)(port=3306)(type=master) : Connection timed out (Connection timed out)
at org.mariadb.jdbc.internal.util.exceptions.ExceptionMapper.get(ExceptionMapper.java:161)`<br />	


### Troubleshooting

1. Do nc test to verify the metastore host is reachable from the customer VNet. Run similar command from a notebook in customer environment.

		%sh nc -zv consolidated-centralus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306
		%sh for i in {1..10} ; do nc -zv consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306
		done

2. Check if customer has configured UDR for whitelisting metastore traffic and [is not using outdated IP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/udr).

3. Check if you can reach metastore outside the customer environment to confirm if it is customer environment specific issue.

4. Try spinning up VM in customer Databricks subnet and see if it is reachable. Involve Network team to troubleshoot on networking setup issues.


### Solution

- Resolve networking connectivity associated with the customer VNet setup. It can be due to firewall, SQL endpoint not whitelisted,  etc.

- If metastore traffic is whitelisted using IP, make sure it is using latest IP as it can change over time.

- If all the workspaces for specific region report metastore unavailable issue, it is MySQL DB issue for the region; file Databricks Salesforce ticket.

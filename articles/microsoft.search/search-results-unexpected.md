# Understanding how Azure Cognitive Search ranks search results

## **Recommended Steps**

 For text queries, Azure Cognitive Search will seamlessly deliver expected results in most scenarios, but occasionally you might get a result that seems "off" somehow. In these situations, having a background in the four stages of Lucene query execution (query parsing, lexical analysis, document matching, scoring) can help you identify specific changes to query parameters or index configuration that will deliver the desired outcome.  For more details on this, please review the following document:

# Issue attaching cognitive services resource

## **Recommended Steps**

If you don't attach a cognitive services resource to your skillset, you may get an error that says that the indexing stopped because the *"free skillset execution quota exceeded"*. This means that you have exceeded the number of documents you can enrich for free. If that is the case you can attach a billable Cognitive Services resource to a skillset for larger and more frequent workloads. 

[This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services) describes how to attach a cognitive services resource to your skillset.

It is important to note that your Cognitive Services resource must be in the **same region** as your Azure Service.

If you want to attach a cognitive service resource programmatically, please see [this section of the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services).

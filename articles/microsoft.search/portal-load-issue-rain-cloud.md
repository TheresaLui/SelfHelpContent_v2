# Issues with Azure Cognitive Search loading the portal (rain cloud icon)

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you are having issues with the search explorer within the portal for Azure Cognitive Search and are seeing a rain cloud icon, this indicates a temporary issue with access to the Azure Portal.  In most cases, reloading the page will solve the issue.  If the problem persists, please check the [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com) page for potential other issues.

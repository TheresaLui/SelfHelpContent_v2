# Issue indexing an Azure Blob data source

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having trouble indexing an Azure Blob data source, you may want to ensure that:

1. Your files are in a [supported format](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage)
1. The data source properties (name, type, credentials, container) are set correctly as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage)
1. The storage account is not encrypted or protected with a firewall

Depending on your security requiments, you may also want to consider using [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-managed-identities-storage) to connect to your Azure Blob data source.

# Issue with the JavaScript or TypeScript SDK

## **Recommended Steps**

* The Azure Cognitive Search JavaScript/TypeScript SDK has two libraries.  Please make sure you are using the correct library for the operation you'd like to perform:

	* [Client library: @azure/search-documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme?view=azure-node-latest) to execute indexing and search operations on an Azure Cognitive Search index
	* [Management library: @azure/arm-search](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/search/management?view=azure-node-latest) to provision a new service, manage api-keys, and adjust resources

* Upgrade to the latest version of the Azure Cognitive Search JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/search-documents) for fixes and improvements
* If you encounter a bug, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues) and mention "Azure Cognitive Search" in the title
* If you would like to provide feedback for a future update of the SDK, see our [feedback page](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search)

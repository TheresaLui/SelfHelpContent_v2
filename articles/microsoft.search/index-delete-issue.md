# Issue deleting an index

## **Recommended Steps**

If you were unable to delete an index using an API call rather than directly from the portal, the response's HTTP status code and message will often give a good indication as to why the call failed. Common reasons for this failure include:

* Using a Query API key as opposed to the required Admin API Key
* Incorrectly formed API request 
* The Index was previously deleted
* The service is currently unavailable. You must have 2 or more replicas to ensure an availability SLA.

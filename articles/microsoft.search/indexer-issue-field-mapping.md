# Issue with indexer field mapping

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having trouble with an indexer field mapping, you may want to ensure that:

1. Your index field names and data source field names match 
1. The data type of the index field matches the data type of the mapped field
1. You are using a [mapping function to transform a field's contents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-indexer-field-mappings) if your field has special characters
1. If you are mapping an enriched field using Cognitive Search, see [output field mappings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-output-field-mapping)

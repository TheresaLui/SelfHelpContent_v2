# Issue with the .Net SDK

## **Recommended Steps**

* The Azure Search .Net SDK has two libraries.  Please make sure you are using the correct library for the operation you'd like to perform:

	* [Client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Search) to execute indexing and search operations on an Azure Search index.
	* [Management library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Search) to provision a new service, manage api-keys, and adjust resources.

* Upgrade to the latest version of the Azure Search .NET SDKs from Nuget.org for fixes and improvements.
* If you encounter a bug, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues) and mention "Azure Search" in the title.
* If you would like to provide feedback for a future update of the SDK, see our [feedback page](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).

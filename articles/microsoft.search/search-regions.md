# Azure Cognitive Search is not available in my desired region

## **Recommended Steps**

If you do not see your preferred region listed when you are provisioning your Azure Cognitive Search service:

1.	Check the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) page to find and select the next most geographically desirable location.
2.	To minimize or avoid bandwidth charges, select the same location for all of the resources you will be using with your Azure Cognitive Search service.

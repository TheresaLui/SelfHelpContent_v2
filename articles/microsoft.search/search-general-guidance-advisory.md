# General guidance or Advisory for Azure Cognitive Search Questions and Issues

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having issues with Azure Cognitive Search, here are some helpful tips to help resolve the issue:

* Documentation: The [Azure Cognitive Search documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/) provides a large amount of information on topics relating to the service as well as common issues that you may run into.
* Stackoverflow: [Stackoverflow tagged with azure-cognitive-search](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-cognitive-search?tab=Newest) provides a resource for you to ask questions which is monitored by the Azure Cognitive Search engineering team as well as the community.  This is also a resource to find previously answered questions and issues.  NOTE:  Azure Cognitive Search, was previously called Azure Search and as a result the azure-search tag can often provide additional information, however if you choose to ask a new question, please add the tag azure-cognitive-search.
* Controls are disabled:  This most likely indicates your search service is in a provisioning state (perhaps from a previous scaling attempt) and you should wait for this to complete and periodically refresh the portal.  If this lasts for multiple hours, please contact customer support.
* If you are having issues with the search explorer within the portal for Azure Cognitive Search and are seeing a rain cloud icon, this indicates a temporary issue with access to the Azure Portal.  In most cases, reloading the page will solve the issue.  If the problem persists, please check the [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com) page for potential other issues.
* Getting started: If you are new to Azure Cognitive Search, there are many resources available to help you get up and running. In addition to [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/tutorial-csharp-create-first-app) and [quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal) in the documentation, there is an [Azure Cognitive Search overview video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Azure-Cognitive-Search-Overview?term=azure%20cognitive%20search&lang-en=true) that provides a succint overview of the service. We also offer a [solution accelerator in Github](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-knowledge-mining) that makes it easy to create a web app with search capabilities.

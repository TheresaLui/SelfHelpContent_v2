# Issue creating a search service

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having trouble creating an Azure Cognitive Search service, you may want to ensure that:

1.	You have access to create resources within your Azure subscription
2.	You have provided a unique name for your search service and followed the naming guidelines found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
3.	You have selected a [supported region](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) for Azure Cognitive Search
4.	You have allowed adequate time for the Azure Cognitive Search service to be deployed. This typically occurs within minutes and can be monitored through Azure notifications.

# Issue creating a search service

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Azure capacity restrictions**

As demand continues to grow, we may periodically be faced with capacity constraints in one or more Azure regions. As a result, customers are currently unable to use the portal to create new Azure Cognitive Search services in the following region(s): **Central India**

At this time we suggest you create your search service in a different region. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes and expect this situation to improve in a couple months as capacity constraints are resolved.

### **General issues creating a search service**  

If you are having trouble creating an Azure Cognitive Search service, you should ensure that:

1.	You have access to create resources within your Azure subscription
2.	You have provided a unique name for your search service and followed the naming guidelines found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
3.	You have selected a [supported region](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) for Azure Cognitive Search
4.	You have allowed adequate time for the Azure Cognitive Search service to be deployed. This typically occurs within minutes and can be monitored through Azure notifications.  In some cases, services on the Basic tier may take up to 90 minutes to provision.  This should be relatively rare, but please allow this much time to pass before opening a support case.
5.	You have not already used your allotted number of free search services.  By default, each subscription is allowed only one free search service.

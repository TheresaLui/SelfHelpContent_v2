# Issue indexing a SQL data source

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having trouble indexing a SQL data source, you may want to ensure that:

1. Your data is populated in the database
1. Your connection string is valid
1. Ensure that the types in your database are supported by Azure Search. See the full list of supported types [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-database-to-azure-search-using-indexers#TypeMapping).
1. No firewall is preventing communication between Azure Search and the database
1. If you want to connect to a SQL Server, on a virtual machine, please follow [this guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-iaas-to-azure-search-using-indexers)


If change detection is not working for you:

1. Make sure to enable [change tracking](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-tracking-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017) in your database
1. Confirm you meet the database version requirements:

	* SQL Server 2012 SP3 and later, if you're using SQL Server on Azure VMs
	* Azure SQL Database V12, if you're using Azure SQL Database

1. Ensure the primary key is not a composite primary key (a primary key containing more than one column) on the table
1. If your data source is a *view* (as opposed to a *table*), you wonâ€™t be able to use SQL Server integrated change detection to refresh an index with incremental changes

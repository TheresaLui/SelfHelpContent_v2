# Issue with the Python SDK

## **Recommended Steps**

* The Azure Cognitive Search Python SDK has two libraries.  Please make sure you are using the correct library for the operation you'd like to perform:

	* [Client library: azure-search-documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/search-documents-readme?view=azure-python) to execute indexing and search operations on an Azure Cognitive Search index
	* [Management library: azure-mgmt-search](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/search/management?view=azure-python) to provision a new service, manage api-keys, and adjust resources

* Upgrade to the latest version of the Azure Cognitive Search Python SDKs from pypi.org for fixes and improvements
* If you encounter a bug, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues) and mention "Azure Cognitive Search" in the title
* If you would like to provide feedback for a future update of the SDK, see our [feedback page](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search)

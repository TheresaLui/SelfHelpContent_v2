# Issues with Azure Cognitive Search portal search explorer

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having issues with the search explorer within the portal for Azure Cognitive Search, here are the most common reasons:

* Long timeframe for response:  Azure Cognitive Search returns 50 documents in a search result.  If your documents contain a lot of data (such as text indexed from a PDF), it can take a long time to load the results into the search explorer.  You can optimize this, by limiting the fields returned ([select](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-pagination-page-layout#total-hits-and-page-counts)) or by limiting the documents that are returned ([top](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-pagination-page-layout#total-hits-and-page-counts))
* Portal showing cloud: This indicates a temporary issue with access to the Azure Portal.  In most cases, reloading the page will solve the issue.  If the problem persists, please check the [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com) page for potential other issues

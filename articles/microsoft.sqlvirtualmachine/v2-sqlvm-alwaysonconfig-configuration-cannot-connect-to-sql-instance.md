# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following steps that can help you.


<!--issueDescription--> 

Most customers are able to resolve their **SQL Connectivity issues** using the following steps.   

<!--/issueDescription--> 

## **Recommended Steps** 


* **Error:"Cannot Generate SSPI Context"** while connecting to SQL Server 

  Connectivity to SQL May fail because of SPN duplication, or incorrectly registered or missing entries. Download and log in to the VM as **Domain Administrator** and [Run Kerberos Configuration Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39046) to fix these SPN issues. 

* **SQL Service does not Start because of Missing TempDB Folders** 

   If you restarted your VM or Resized your VM, SQL might not start because of Tempdb Files/Folders missing on the D Drive. We are working on a fix for this. Run the following script to create the TempDB structure: 

    ```PS 
      $SQLService="SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)" 
      $SQLAgentService="SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)" 
      $tempfolder="D:\tempDB\Data" 
      $logfolder="D:\tempDB\Log" 
      if (!(test-path -path $tempfolder)) 
       {     
       New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $logfolder   
       New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $tempfolder 
       } 
       Start-Service $SQLService  
       Start-Service $SQLAgentService 
    ```
      
* **Seeing Login Failures for Account "NT SERVICE\\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery".** 

     Uninstalling and [reinstalling Resource Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-resource-provider-register?tabs=bash%2Cazure-cli#lightweight-management-mode) can fix the issue. Installing full-weight management Mode for Resource provider requires a SQL Service restart. Make sure you have that as a login in your SQL Server, or, alternatively, run the following command: 

    ```SQL 
      CREATE LOGIN [NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master] 
      GO 
      ALTER SERVER ROLE [sysadmin] ADD MEMBER [NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery] 
      GO 
    ``` 

* **Azure Active Directory authentication/connectivity is not supported with Azure SQL VM** 

   SQL Server on Azure VM supports Windows Authentication and SQL Authentication. See [this documentation]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview).

* **I forgot sysadmin (sa) password, how do I login to SQL Server Instance?**  

     To gain access to SQL Server, run the following command in the command prompt with Administrator privileges. Replace the domain and login with your domain and the user that you want: 

   ```SQL     
      NET STOP MSSQLSERVER 
      NET START MSSQLSERVER /m"SQLCMD" 
      sqlcmd -S MY_SERVER_NAME 
      CREATE LOGIN [Domain\login] FROM WINDOWS;  
      GO 
      ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER [Domain\login]; 
      Go 
      Exit 
      NET STOP MSSQLSERVER 
      NET start MSSQLSERVER 
   ``` 

* **90% of SQL instance connectivity Issues are resolved by following the below Diagnose and Mitigate action Steps** 

    * If you are having issues connecting to SQL Server Instance on Azure VM from a different network or on-premises, see [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/ways-to-connect-to-sql) 

   * Make sure that the port used by SQL Server (1433) is open for inbound/outbound connections. You can [telnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/telnet) to the port or use [Test-NetConnection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=win10-ps#example-3--test-tcp-connectivity-and-display-detailed-results) to check if it's blocked at **NSG or Windows Firewall**. To make sure your company firewall is not blocking these connections, check with your Network Admin. An outbound rule from where you make a connection must be added for the SQL Port to Windows Firewall and the company firewall.   

  * Make sure TCP/IP and shared memory in [SQL server configuration are enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-ver15#SSMSProcedure) 
 
  * You may see intermittent connectivity issues to SQL instance if your AG failed over, or if you are having AG [lease timeout](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-lease-healthcheck-timeout?view=sql-server-ver15#updating-cluster-and-always-on-timeout-values), or if you are having issues with [SQL Performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices), network issues, or [disk or VM throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-performance-windows#storage-io-utilization-metrics). Check the SQL error log to find out more.

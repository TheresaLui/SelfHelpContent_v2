# Troubleshoot my Network Security Group (NSG)

4 out of 5 customers resolved their VM Network Security Group issue using the steps below.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

NSGs by default deny connections from Internet unless it is explicitly allowed. To resolve this issue, try one or more of the below steps.<br>

1. Use [IP flow verify](data-blade:microsoft_azure_network.verifyipflowblade.id.$subscriptionId) to confirm if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking traffic to or from a virtual machine
2. Edit the [Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group) to make changes to the rules if needed
3. If there is no rule to allow the traffic from Internet, add a new rule to allow access to the backend port, with source being 'Internet', '\*' or a specific public IP address

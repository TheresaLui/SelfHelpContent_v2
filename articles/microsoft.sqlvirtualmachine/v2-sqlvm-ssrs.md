# SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)

### Common Issues

* **Where can I find the license key to use for installing SSRS 2017+ in an Azure SQL VM?**

If you already have a SQL Server VM created from Azure Marketplace, you can launch setup.exe from ***C:\SQLServerFull***, copy the product key that appears in the install process and exit the installer. You can then apply the key during SSRS installation.

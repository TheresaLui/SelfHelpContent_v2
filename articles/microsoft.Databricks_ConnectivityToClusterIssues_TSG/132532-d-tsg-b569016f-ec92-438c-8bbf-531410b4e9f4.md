# Connection timed out with Metastore client

### Symptom
Connection timed out with Metastore client.

```
java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Could not connect to address=(host=consolidated-centralus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com)(port=3306)(type=master) : Connection timed out (Connection timed out)
at org.mariadb.jdbc.internal.util.exceptions.ExceptionMapper.get(ExceptionMapper.java:161)
```

### Troubleshooting
Do below checks:

- Do nc test to verify the metastore host is reachable from the customer VNet. Run command from a notebook in customer environment:

    `%sh nc -zv consolidated-centralus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306` <br />
	  `%sh for i in {1..10} ; do nc -zv consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306` <br />
	  `done`
	
- Check if customer has configured UDR, whitelisted metastore traffic, and used [updated IP address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/udr).

- Check if you can reach metastore outside customer environment to confirm if it is customer environment specific issue.

- Try spinning up VM in customer Databricks subnet and see if it is reachable. Involve Network team to troubleshoot networking setup issues.

### Solution
- Resolve networking connectivity associated with the customer VNet setup. It can be due to firewall, SQL endpoint not whitelisted, etc.

- If metastore traffic is whitelisted using IP, make sure it is using latest IP as it can change over time.

- If all workspaces in specific region report metastore unavailable issue, this means it is a MySQL DB issue for the region itself. In this case, file Databricks Salesforce ticket.

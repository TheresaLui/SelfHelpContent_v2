# Cluster startup failure with Metastore Component Unhealthy error

### Symptom
Cluster startup failure with error: ` Cluster terminated. Reason: Metastore Component Unhealthy`

### Troubleshooting
1. Do below tests to verify Metastore is available and responding or atleast the driver can send the request:

    `	%sh telnet consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306 ` <br />
		` Trying 23.99.34.75... Connected to cr1.westus1-a.control.database.windows.net. Escape character is '^]'. `
		
    If you don't see the output as above, issues could be due to firewall, SQL endpoint not whitelisted, etc. 


2. Once we confirm Metastore is responding, it could be that connection is flaky. Run below command from notebook multiple times and confirm if connection can be reached and port is open:

    `	%sh  for i in {1..10} ; do nc -zv consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306`<br />
		`done` <br />
		`	Unknown host cr2.westus1-a.control.database.windows.net [104.42.238.205] 3306 (mysql) open`	<br />
		`Unknown host cr2.westus1-a.control.database.windows.net [104.42.238.205] 3306 (mysql) open `

    If below error is hit randomly it means route to consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com is randomly flaky:

    ```
		java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Could not connect to address=(host=consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com)(port=3306)(type=master) : Connection timed out (Connection timed out)
		```


### Solution
- If you are not able to reach the metastore from driver via telnet, please check VNet peering is setup correctly or endpoints are still valid.

- If all setup looks fine, one workaound would be to stop cluster and wait 5 mins after a failed launch to make sure that driver node does not get reused (In case if the driver node was bad).

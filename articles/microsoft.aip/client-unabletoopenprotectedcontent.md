# Azure Information Protection client - unable to open protected content

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that you are signed in with the correct user account that has permissions to open the protected content
2. If you are trying to open files other than Office documents (such as files that have a file name extension of .ppdf, .pjpg, .ppng, .ptxt, or .pfile) use the Azure Information Protection viewer
3. If you are using Office 2010 to open protected content, verify that you have the Azure Information Protection client installed
4. Please review the following documentation to verify that you are using a supported file type with a supported application: [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements-applications)
5. If you experience issues with external collaboration, please review [Configuring secure document collaboration by using Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/secure-collaboration-documents)
6. If you need to open a content where you don't have permissions to (user has left the company, etc.) you can use the Super User feature: [Configuring super users for Azure Information Protection and discovery services or data recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-super-users)
7. If you are still experiencing the issue, collect Azure Information Protection client logs and attach the exported logs to this ticket

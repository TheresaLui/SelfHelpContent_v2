# Azure Information Protection - Protecting and Opening Content - Questions about applying protection with the AIP Scanner

To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, the classic client and label management in the Azure portal are being deprecated as of March 31, 2021. Learn more from our [new article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/azure-aip-portal-label-amp-policy-management-admin-experience/ba-p/2182678).

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you're running the scanner installed with the unified labeling client, run [Start-AIPScannerDiagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/start-aipscannerdiagnostics?view=azureipps) to troubleshoot common deployment issues.

* Troubleshoot your on-premises scanner deployment with our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner-tsg).

### Export Azure Information Protection Scanner logs

Whether you're using the unified labeling or classic client, export scanner logs as follows:

1. Navigate to `%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP`, for the user that's running the scanner service.
1. Zip all the contents in the **MSIP** folder.
1. Save the logs to a location of your choice, and then attach them to your service request.

**Note:** If you're not currently logged in as the user running the scanner service, use the [`Export-AIPLogs -OnBehalfOf`](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/export-aiplogs?view=azureipps) cmdlet to export logs.

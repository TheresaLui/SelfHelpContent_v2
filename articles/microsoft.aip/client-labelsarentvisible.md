# Azure Information Protection client - labels aren't visible

## Recommended troubleshooting steps

If your issue is with a label that applies protection, verify the following:

1. You are using an [edition of Office that supports protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/get-started/requirements#applications), such as Office 365 ProPlus.

2. You are signed in with the correct Azure AD user for your tenant.

   To check your signed-in account, select the **Protect** button -> **Help and Feedback**, and view user account that's displayed.

3. If the label is visible in some Office apps but not all Office apps, check whether the label is configured for the **Set user-defined permissions** option: - If this option is enabled and **In Outlook apply Do Not Forward** is selected, the label displays in Outlook only.
- If this option is enabled and **In Word, Excel, PowerPoint and File Explorer prompt user for custom permissions** is selected, the label displays in Word, Excel, PowerPoint and File Explorer, but not Outlook.


If you still experience the issue, collect Azure Information Protection client logs and attach the exported logs to this ticket.

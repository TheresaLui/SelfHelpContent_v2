# RMS Connector - FCI

## **Recommended Steps**

* [How File servers that run Windows Server and use File Classification Infrastructure (FCI) support Azure Rights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/file-server-support)
* [RMS protection with Windows Server File Classification Infrastructure (FCI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/configure-fci)

There are 2 ways of integrating FCI with AIP:

1. via the RMS Connector
2. Directly

### Via Connector

1. Make sure all the [pre-requisites are met](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-servers-rms-connector#configuring-a-file-server-for-file-classification-infrastructure-to-use-the-connector)<br>
2. Update your [File server and File Classification Infrastructure registry settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-connector-registry-settings#file-server-and-file-classification-infrastructure-registry-settings)<br>

If the above didn't help, please collect the below logs and add them to your support ticket:

1. RMS Analyzer trace run on the FCI Server when trying to pull templates or reproducing any other problem
2. The event logs of the [RMS connector servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/monitor-rms-connector)<br>
3. The [RMS connector traces](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/monitor-rms-connector#logging)<br>

### Directly

1. Make sure all the [pre-requisites are met](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/configure-fci)<br>
2. Run the troubleshooting steps, including the commands, in PowerShell alone without the connector:

	1. [Set-RMSServerAuthentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-rmsserverauthentication?view=azureipps)
	2. Get-RMSServer after you did step 1
	3. Get-RMSTemplate after you did step 1

If the above didn't help, please collect the below logs and add them to your support ticket:

1. Create an [RMS connector trace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/monitor-rms-connector#logging)<br>
2. RMS Analyzer:<br>

	* [Download RMS Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46437)<br>
	* Start as local admin
	* Go straight to the logging tab<br>
	* Start logging<br>
	* Reproduce the issue<br>
	* Afterwards stop logging<br>
	* Attach the create zip/cab file to the support call and explain what you are trying to do<br>

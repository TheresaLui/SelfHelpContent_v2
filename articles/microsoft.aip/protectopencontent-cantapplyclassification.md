## **Recommended Steps**

1. Select **Reset Settings** from the **Sensitivity/Protect** button on the Office ribbon, then **Help and feedback**. 

    This actionÂ signs out the user, deletes the currently downloaded Azure Information Protection policy, and resets the user settings for the Azure Rights Management service.
1. Azure Information Protection does not support having multiple versions of Office installed and multiple users signed in to Office. Try again after signing out all users currently signed into Office. [More information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements#applications)

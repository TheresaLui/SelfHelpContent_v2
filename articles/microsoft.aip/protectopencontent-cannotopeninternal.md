# Azure Information Protection - Protecting and Opening Content - Cannot open protected content - Internal

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that you are signed in with the correct user account, with permissions to open the protected content.
2. If you are trying to open files other than Office documents (such as files that have a file name extension of **.ppdf,** **.pjpg,** **.ppng,** **.ptxt,** or **.pfile**) use the Azure Information Protection viewer.
3. If you are using Office 2010 to open protected content, verify that you have the Azure Information Protection client installed.
4. Review the following documentation to verify that you are using a supported file type with a supported application: [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements-applications)
5. If you need to open content where you don't have permissions, such as if the user has left the company, you can use the Super User feature: [Configuring super users for Azure Information Protection and discovery services or data recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-super-users)
6. Make sure you have followed all network requirements as described at [Firewalls and network infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements#firewalls-and-network-infrastructure)
7. If you need to open a PDF file that was protected using AIP client - you can also open it with Adobe Acrobat Reader with [MIP plugin](https://helpx.adobe.com/il_en/acrobat/kb/mip-plugin-download.html) 
8. If you are still experiencing the issue, collect Azure Information Protection client logs and attach the exported logs to this ticket.

2. Select the **Sensitivity**/**Protect** button -> **Help and feedback**.

# Scaling

The Premium integration service environment (ISE) base unit has a fixed capacity. If you need more throughput, add more scale units either during or after creation. You can auto-scale based on either performance metrics or the number of additional processing units.

* [Add ISE capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment#add-ise-capacity)

* [Delete ISE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment#delete-ise)

After you delete your ISE, you might have to wait up to nine hours before deleting your Azure virtual network or subnets.

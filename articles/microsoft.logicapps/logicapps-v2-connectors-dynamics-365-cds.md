# Azure Logic Apps - Dynamics 365 and CDS

Connect to your Dynamics 365 account so that you can create and manage records, items, and more.

The [Dynamics 365 connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/dynamicscrmonline/?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) is [deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support), but continues to work until removed. No timeline is yet announced for removing it. You're not required to convert existing logic apps to the Common Data Service connector or other planned new connector, but you need convert your logic apps when the connector is removed.

## Dynamics 365 and CDS Overview

The [Common Data Service connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/commondataservice/?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) provides the same capabilities as the deprecated Dynamics 365 connector, but includes improvements that increase reliability. For information about using the Common Data Service connector in logic apps, see [Create and manage Common Data Service records by using Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/connect-common-data-service?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).

# Enterprise Integration Pack

The Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP) for the Logic Apps feature of Azure App Service lets you build and manage B2B workloads with your trading partners by providing support for AS2, X12, and EDIFACT protocols. The EIP also includes XML processing capabilities for flat file conversion to XML, schema validation, and transformation.

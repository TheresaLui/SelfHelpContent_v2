# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - Azure Storage

You can create logic apps that automate tasks and workflows for managing your files. For example, you can build logic apps that [create, get, update, and delete files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage) in your storage account.

## **Recommended Documents**

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - Service Bus

With Azure Logic Apps and the Azure Service Bus connector, you can create automated tasks and workflows that transfer data, such as sales and purchase orders, journals, and inventory movements across applications for your organization. Manage asynchronous messages, sessions, and topic subscriptions with the most commonly used connector in Logic Apps.

## **Recommended Documents**

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

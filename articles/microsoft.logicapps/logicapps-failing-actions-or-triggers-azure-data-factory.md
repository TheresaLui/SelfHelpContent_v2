# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - Azure Data Factory

[Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azuredatafactory/) is a hybrid data integration service that allows you to create, schedule and orchestrate your ETL/ELT workflows at scale wherever your data lives, in cloud or self-hosted network.

It is available in all Logic Apps regions except the following:

* Azure Government regions<br>
* Azure China regions

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

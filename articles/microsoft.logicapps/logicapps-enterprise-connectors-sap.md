# Enterprise Connector - SAP

The Logic Appsâ€™ connector works with SAP's classic releases such as R/3 and ECC systems on-premises or hosted in Azure Virtual Machine. The connector also enables integration with SAP's newer HANA-based SAP systems, such as S/4 HANA, whether they're hosted on-premises or in the cloud. The SAP connector supports message or data integration to and from SAP NetWeaver-based systems through Intermediate Document (IDoc), Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI), or Remote Function Call (RFC).

# Logic Apps other monitoring issues

## **Recommended Steps**

After you [create and run a logic app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow), you can check its runs history, trigger history, status, and performance. For real-time event monitoring and richer debugging, you can set up [diagnostics logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps#azure-diagnostics) for your logic app. That way, you can [find and view events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps#find-events), like trigger events, run events, and action events. You can also use this [diagnostics data with other services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps#extend-diagnostic-data), like Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs.

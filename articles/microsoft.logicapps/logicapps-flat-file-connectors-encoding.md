# Flat File Connector - Encoding

## **Recommended Steps**

Encode XML content before you send it to a business partner in a business-to-business (B2B) scenario. The logic app that you create can get its XML content from a variety of sources, including from an HTTP request trigger, from another application, or even from one of the many connectors.

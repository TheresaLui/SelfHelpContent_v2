# Development and Creation of Logic Apps -other issues"

## **Recommended Steps**

Design and deploy your logic apps from within Visual Studio using the Visual Studio tools for Azure Logic Apps. The designer integrates with the current Azure Resource Group project so you can seamlessly work with resource deployments that include Logic Apps. For more information, see [Azure Logic Apps Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-logic-apps-tools-for-visual-studio-2019).

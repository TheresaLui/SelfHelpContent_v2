# Custom Connectors - SOAP

## **Recommended Steps**

Although Azure Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors that you can use in logic app workflows, you might want to integrate SOAP services in your logic app workflows, you can create and register a custom Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) connector by using Web Services Description Language (WSDL) that describes your SOAP service. The SOAP connectors work like prebuilt connectors, so you can use them in the same way as other connectors in your logic apps.

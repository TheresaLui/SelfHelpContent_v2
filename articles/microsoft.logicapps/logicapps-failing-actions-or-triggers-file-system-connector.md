# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - File System

With the File System connector and Azure Logic Apps, you can create automated tasks and workflows that create and manage files on an on-premises file share.

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

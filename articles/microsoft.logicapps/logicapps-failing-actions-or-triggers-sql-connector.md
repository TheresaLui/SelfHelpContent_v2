# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - SQL

You can access data in your SQL database from inside a logic app with the SQL Server connector.

* [Connect to SQL Server or Azure SQL Database from Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-sqlazure)<br>
* [SQL Server known issues and limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/sql/)

## **Recommended Documents**

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

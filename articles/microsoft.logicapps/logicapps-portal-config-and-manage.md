# Logic Apps portal configuration and management

## **Recommended Steps**

- You can create, edit, manage and deploy logic apps in the Azure Portal. For more information, see: [Quickstart : Create your first automated workflow with Azure Logic Apps â€“ Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow).

- After you create and run a logic app, you can check its runs history, trigger history, status, and performance. For more information, see: [Troubleshoot and diagnose workflow failures in Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-diagnosing-failures).

- Before you can build [enterprise integration and B2B solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview) by using [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview), you need to create an integration account, which is a separate Azure resource that provides a secure, scalable, and manageable container for the integration artifacts that you define and use with your logic app workflows. For more information, see: [Create and manage integration accounts for B2B solutions by using Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account).

# Azure Logic Apps - IBM 3270

With Azure Logic Apps and the IBM 3270 connector, you can access and run IBM mainframe apps that you usually drive by navigating through 3270 emulator screens. That way, you can integrate your IBM mainframe apps with Azure, Microsoft, and other apps, services, and systems by creating automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps.

The connector communicates with IBM mainframes by using the TN3270 protocol and is available in all Azure Logic Apps regions except for Azure Government and Azure China 21Vianet.

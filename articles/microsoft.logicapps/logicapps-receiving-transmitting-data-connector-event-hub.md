# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - Event Hub

You can monitor and manage events sent to Azure Event Hubs from inside a logic app with the Azure Event Hubs connector. That way, you can create logic apps that automate tasks and workflows for checking, sending, and receiving events from your Event Hub. For connector-specific technical information, see the Azure Event Hubs connector reference.

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

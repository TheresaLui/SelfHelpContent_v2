# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - SAP

The SAP connector for Logic Apps enables bidirectional integration of data between SAP and other LOB applications or SaaS. The connector works with SAP's classical releases such R/3, ECC systems on-premises. The connector also enables integration with the SAP's newer HANA based SAP systems such as S/4 HANA, wherever they are hosted - on premises or in cloud. The SAP connector supports message or data integration to and from SAP systems through Intermediate Document (IDoc) or Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) or Remote Function Call (RFC).

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

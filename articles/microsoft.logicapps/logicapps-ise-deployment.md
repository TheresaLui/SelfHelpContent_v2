# Deploy Logic Apps Integration Service Environment

## **Recommended Steps**

Integration Service Environment (ISE) is a dedicated private environment where you can run your logic apps and inject that environment inside your Azure Virtual Network (VNET), then you have access to your on-premises and other entities. When you create an ISE, Azure deploys a private and isolated instance of the Logic Apps service into your Azure Virtual Network.

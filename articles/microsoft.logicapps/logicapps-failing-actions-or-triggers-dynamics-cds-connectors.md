# Receiving or Transmitting data through a specific Connector - Dynamics

With Azure Logic Apps and the Dynamics 365 connector, you can create automated tasks and workflows based on your records in Dynamics 365. Your workflows can create records, update items, return records, and more in your Dynamics 365 account.

Connectors provide quick access from Azure Logic Apps to events, data, and actions across other apps, services, systems, protocols, and platforms. By using connectors in your logic apps, you expand the capabilities for your cloud and on-premises apps to perform tasks with the data that you create and already have.

# IP addresses my app sends are all 0.0.0.0  


Application Insights now sets all octets of the IP address collected by client/server side SDKs to zero after looking up the City, Country and other geo location attributes. This strengthens privacy and is a change from prior processing that set only the last octet to zero. 

This change was made to address customer concerns with IP addresses given GDPR. 

Note: 

This does not affect data collected prior to February 5, 2018 

## **Recommended Steps**

IP address can be captured in a custom property if you wish, using the [Telemetry Initializers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-filtering-sampling#add-properties-itelemetryinitializer).

# **Cannot enable Application Insights for my app running on Azure App Service**

## Common issues

1. The Application Insights option is grayed out and not clickable
![Application Insights Menu Item](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/media/troubleshoot/data-collection/appinsights-disabled.png)
2. The Application Insights option is clickable, but it is not possible to advance beyond the options screen

## **Recommended Steps**

### **If the Application Insights option is grayed out**
1. The specified language/tech stack may not be supported. Here is what you need to know: 
    * Currently you can enable codeless integration with Application Insights for .Net, .NetCore, Java and Node.js (public preview on Linux and private preview on Windows)
    * For Python you would need to add SDK to your code

### **If the Application Insights option is clickable, but you can't advance beyond the first screen**
1. You are using a free subscription AND happen to have Application Insights enabled for other resources. 
![Application Insights Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/media/troubleshoot/data-collection/appinsights-plan.png) 

Try this:
* [**Easiest**] Change the subscription level
* [**Cheapest**] Disable Application Insights for the other resource first
2. The OS and runtime combination you selected is not supported.

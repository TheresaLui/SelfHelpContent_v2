# I am having problems with my .NET SDK data

## **Recommended steps**

The most common types of issues are related to the configuration of the SDK, or a network configuration issue such as a proxy or firewall. Here is a list of recommended items to review to ensure your application is configured correctly. Our [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-troubleshoot-no-data) has a list of the most common concerts with problems using the .NET SDK.

1. First, review the .NET SDK [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net) and check the default configuration
2. If you're using .NET Core, review the .NET Core SDK [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-core) and check the default configuration
3. If you're configuration looks correct, enable the [SDK Logs](http://sergeysharp.com/blog/2015/04/16/diagnostic-of-applicationinsights-sdk/) and search for errors
4. If you spot an exception or strange error ensure the java version you're using does not have any known issues by checking the [.NET SDK Releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/releases) page
5. Most errors have been reported on GitHub and you can search the [.NET SDK Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/issues) for existing solutions
6. Lastly, review the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-troubleshoot-no-data) for other possible areas to troubleshoot

**App Service Integration Change** We recently changed the way we integrate with App Services. You no longer need to have the extension installed (in the Extensions blade). You should remove the Application Insights extension from the App Service extension blade and use the [new experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-monitor%2Ftoc.json) to enable this.

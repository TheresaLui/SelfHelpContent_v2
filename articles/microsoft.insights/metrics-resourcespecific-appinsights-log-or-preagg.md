Application Insights has two types of metrics: the metrics that are based on the captured events in logs are called *log-based metrics*, and *standard metrics* that are pre-aggregated during collection and stored in the Azure metrics repository. Each metric type brings a unique value in monitoring application health, diagnostics and analytics. The developers who are instrumenting their applications can decide which type of metric is best suited to a particular scenario, depending on the size of the application, expected volume of telemetry, and business requirements for metrics precision and alerting.

The **log-based metrics** behind the scene is an abstraction layer that translates each request for metric values into a Kusto query on top of raw events. See [the underlying queries for each Application Insights log-based metric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/app-insights-metrics). The log-based metrics have more dimensions and, therefore, have greater analytical value but the accuracy of log-based metrics may be impacted by the telemetry volume reduction techniques such as sampling, filtering, or data capping.

The **standard pre-aggregated metrics** provide faster query time and high precision (as they aren't impacted by sampling, filtering, or data-capping), which makes them a superior choice for alerting or dashboards. However, standard pre-aggregated metrics have fewer dimensions and may be more limited in the analytical scenarios.

# I should have received email for an alert

## **Recommended Steps**

If you're certain that an alert has generated an event but has not sent an email notification, please check the following:

1. The email client SPAM settings (Outlook, Gmail)
2. The email server SPAM/quarantine settings (Exchange, O365, G Suite)
3. Any email security appliances (Barracuda, Cisco)
4. If the email is a distribution list, make sure it can receive external email
5. Look for any unsubscribe email notifications, and check with colleagues if the email is a distribution list
6. Review your contact information for your [Azure account profile](https://account.azure.com/Profile)

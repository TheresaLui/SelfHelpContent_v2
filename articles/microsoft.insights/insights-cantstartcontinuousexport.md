# I can't configure a new continuous export

## **Recommended Steps**

To ensure that you are able to successfully configure a new continuous export rule, verify that the storage account is configured correctly. It is required that you have write access to the storage account that you wish to configure a new continuous export for.  Premium storage accounts are not supported for continuous export.

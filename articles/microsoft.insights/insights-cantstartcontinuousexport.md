# I can't configure a new continuous export
## **Recommended steps**
To ensure that you are able to successfully configure a new continuous export rule:

1. Verify that the storage account is configured correctly.  It is required that you have write access to the storage account that you wish to configure a new continuous export for.  Premium storage accounts are not supported for continuous export.

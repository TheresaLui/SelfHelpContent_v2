# What are Community Supported SDKs?

## **Recommended steps**
If you're using a community supported SDK you will need to open an issue in GitHub to the respective project. Please see the links below for the GitHub repository.

### Community Supported

Community SDKs are a series of frameworks for variety of programming languages. These are projects that started as a response to open source projects that needed monitoring. There is no guarantee of how often these projects are updated and if they are currently in working order. It is not recommended to run these in a production work load.

### Depreciated

These SDKs were once official but have since been replaced with HockeyApp and then AppCenter. Please review the [AppCenter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-mobile-center-quickstart) documentation for the most up to date information.

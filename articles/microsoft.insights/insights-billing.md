# I have questions about my bill with Application Insights

## **Recommended Steps**

**How do I get a refund?**<br>

To get a refund open, a **Billing** ticket for **free** from the support page by selecting **Billing** as the Issue Type. This will route to our billing department who will engage us. 

**How much is Application Insights costing me?**

The Application Insights Usage and estimated costs page will show you an estimate of your costs based on the last 30-days of usage. To understand what is making up the data volume, there is also a 30-day chart of data volume segmented by data type. Learn more about using the Usage and estimated costs page.<br>

**How can I reduce my costs?**<br>

There are several ways to reduce costs of using Application Insights, all of which involve reducing data volumes such as [sampling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling).

**How do I change the daily cap?**<br>

From the Application Insights Usage and estimated costs page, there is a "Daily cap" option. Here you can enter any value up to 1000 GB/day. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832795) about setting the daily cap.<br>

**How can I get a daily cap above the maximum level?**<br>

If you need more than 1000 GB/day, send an email to AIDataCap@microsoft.com with your Application Insights resourceâ€™s instrumentation key or application ID and information about your request. <br>

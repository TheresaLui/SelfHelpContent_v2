# I am seeing errors with telemetry collection

## **Recommended Steps**

For all supported SDKs you should not see any errors relating to telemetry collection. If you are seeing errors that are specific to **dc.services.visualstudio.com**, please use the steps below. If you are seeing other errors coming from your application, please go back and open a case for the SDK.

1. Verify the version of the SDK you are using is up to date or a [supported version](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home#officially-supported-sdks)
2. If the errors are inside of your telemetry, please go back and open a case for the correct SDK
3. If you are receiving an error message from the service, it is likely that we are experiencing issues and it is recommended to open a case for tracking

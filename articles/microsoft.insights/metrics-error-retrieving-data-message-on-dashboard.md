## **My chart shows Error Retrieving Data message on dashboard**

This problem may happen when your dashboard was created with a metric that was later deprecated and removed from Azure. To verify that it is the case, open the **Metrics** tab of your resource, and check the available metrics in the metric picker. If the metric is not shown, the metric has been removed from Azure. Usually, when a metric is deprecated, there is a better new metric that provides with a similar perspective on the resource health.

## **Recommended Steps**

Update the failing tile by picking an alternative metric for your chart on dashboard. You can [review a list of available metrics for Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

# Where's my data?

## **Your application sent invalid telemetry**
<!--issueDescription-->
Our diagnostic has detected that the Application Insights resource with name <!--$ComponentName-->[ComponentName]<!--/$ComponentName--> and instrumentation key <!--$InstrumentationKey-->[InstrumentationKey]<!--/$InstrumentationKey--> has sent invalid telemetry <!--$Time-->[Time]<!--/$Time-->. This is an indication that your application either has some type of data corruption while sending the telemetry or you are using an SDK that is not part of our supported languages, frameworks, and platforms.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

The most common reason for this is when you implement a custom SDK to send telemetry or are using an SDK that is not part of our [supported languages, frameworks, and platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/platforms). If you find that you're not using a one of these frameworks you should contact the developer of that SDK.

1. Verify you are using a [supported language, framework, or platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/platforms)
1. For Java apps, make sure to use the [Application Insights Java 3.0 agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent), and check the [agent self diagnostic logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-standalone-troubleshoot#check-the-self-diagnostic-log-file)
1. Check the SDK logs using [self diagnostics for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-troubleshoot-no-data)
1. (advanced) If you can reproduce this locally use a web inspection proxy like Fiddler to inspect the contents of the web payload and compare it to the schema that [is generated by this tool](https://github.com/microsoft/SchemaGenerator)

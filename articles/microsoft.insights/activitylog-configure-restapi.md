The activity log contains all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your resources. It doesn't include read operations (GET). You can use the activity logs to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.
You can retrieve information from activity logs and export them by creating diagnostic logs settings via REST API


## **Recommended Steps**

1. The REST operations for working with the activity log are part of the [Insights REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/). To retrieve activity log events, see [List the management events in a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/activitylogs).
1. Review [how to view activity logs to monitor actions on resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/view-activity-logs#rest-api)
1. Review [Diagnostic settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) and then [how to configure diagnostic settings using REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings#configure-diagnostic-settings-using-rest-api)

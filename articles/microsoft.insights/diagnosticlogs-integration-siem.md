Platform logs in Azure, including Azure Activity log and resource logs, provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on.  Platform metrics are collected by default and typically stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database. Platform logs and metrics can be sent to various destinations, including [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) that allows you to stream data to external systems such as third-party SIEMs and other log analytics solutions. Following steps will walk you through how to enable platform log export to Event Hub.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Familiarize with the different [destinations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings#destinations) available as well as the Destination requirements.
1. Ensure you have the right access requirements to be able to export logs via Event Hub.

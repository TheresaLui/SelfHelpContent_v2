# How do I troubleshoot the Application Map?

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure you're using an officially supported SDK. Unsupported/community SDKs might not support correlation. Refer to [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-platforms) for a list of supported SDKs.
2. Upgrade all components to the latest SDK version. 
3. If you're using Azure Functions with C#, upgrade to [Functions V2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions).
4. Confirm [cloud_RoleName](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-map#Set-cloud-RoleName) is correctly configured.
5. If you're missing a dependency, make sure it's in the list of [auto-collected dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/auto-collect-dependencies). If not, you can still track it manually with a [track dependency call](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics#trackdependency).

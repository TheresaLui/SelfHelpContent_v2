## I can't find my resource to select it in metrics explorer

You clicked on the **Select a resource** button, but don't see your resource in the resource picker dialog.

## **Recommended Steps**

Metrics explorer requires you to select subscriptions and resource groups before listing available resources. If you don't see your resource:

* Ensure that you've selected correct subscription in the **Subscription** dropdown. If your subscription isn't listed, click on the  **Directory + Subscription settings** and add a subscription with your resource.
* Ensure that you've selected the correct resource group. **NOTE**: For best performance, when you first open metrics explorer, the **Resource group** dropdown has no pre-selected resource groups. You must pick at least one group before you can see any resources.

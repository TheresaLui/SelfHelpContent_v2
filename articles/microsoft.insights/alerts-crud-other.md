# My issue is with another alert type

There are alerts in Azure which are only partially managed, or not managed at all through Azure Monitor. 

## **Recommended Steps**

### Smart Detector alerts

Application Insights [Smart Detector / Failure anomalies alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/proactive-failure-diagnostics) are created automatically when an Application Insights resource is created. You can configure existing Failure Anomalies alert rules in the Azure portal.

### Alerts originated by partner monitoring tools

Alerts created by System Center Operations Manager, Zabbix and Nagios monitoring tools [can be integrated with Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-managing-nagios-zabbix-scom), so that alerts triggered by those tools can be viewed in Azure Monitor. However the alert rule configuration can only be viewed/edited in respective monitoring tools.  

### Azure Security Center alerts

[Azure Security Center alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts) are configured or managed through Azure Security Center and not through Azure Monitor. 

### Azure Sentinel alerts

[Azure Sentinel alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in) are created and managed through Azure Sentinel and not through Azure Monitor. 

### Azure cost management alerts

[Azure cost management alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending) are created and managed through Azure Cost Management and not through Azure Monitor.

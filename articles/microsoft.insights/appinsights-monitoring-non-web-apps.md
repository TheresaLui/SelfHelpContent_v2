# **Monitoring Non-Web (Non-HTTP/Background) Applications**


## Common issues 
The types of applications that do not use HTTP requests, such as messaging, background, and console applications, cannot utilize Application Insights SDKs or agent designed for web apps. 

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Install `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService` SDK: 
    * [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService)
1. Follow the guidance for these currently supported scenarios:
    * [.NET Core 3.0 Worker Service applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/worker-service#net-core-30-worker-service-application)
    * [.Net Core Background tasks with hosted services in .Net Core 2.1/2.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/worker-service#aspnet-core-background-tasks-with-hosted-services)
    * [.NET Core/.NET framework console apps in .NET Core 2.0 or higher, and .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/worker-service#net-corenet-framework-console-application)


Please note that monitoring non-HTTP applications is currently not supported in Java, Node.js, Python.

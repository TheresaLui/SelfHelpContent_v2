# I see a message that my workspace region is not supported

Azure Monitor for VMs is available in many Azure regions, but not all of them.  When trying to enable Azure Monitor for VMs from the Azure portal, if you don't see your existing workspace listed as an option, it could indicate that it is not in a supported region.

## **Recommended Documents**

* For a list of our supported regions, refer to our [deployment documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-enable-overview#log-analytics).

For information about workspace planning you can refer to the following:

* [Log Analytics FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/faq#logs) 
* [Log Analytics for Service Providers design guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/service-providers#architectures-for-service-providers)

# I have an issue in creating, editing or deleting Service or Resource Health alert rules in the Azure portal

Resolve issues around Service or Resource Health alert rules using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

**1.	What is the difference between Service Health alert and Resource Health alert, and how do I configure them?**

* [Service Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/service-health-overview) tracks the health of Azure services across the subscriptions and regions in which you operate. [Configure Service Health alert rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal) to get notifications of ongoing service issues, upcoming planned maintenance, or relevant health / security advisories, that has impact on you.

* [Resource Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) tracks the health of your specific Azure resources. [Configure Resource Health alert rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-monitor-guide) to get notifications when changes occur in your resource’s health status (for example, when a specific virtual machine becomes unavailable).


**1. I created an alert rule, but I don’t see it in the portal.**

     Existing alert rules can be reviewed in **Monitor** > **Alerts** > **Manage Alert Rules**.
   Service Health alert rules can also be reviewed in **Service Health** > **Health Alerts**.


**1.	I am not sure if I have the permissions to author the alert.**

     To author alerts, you must have the role of [monitoring contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/roles-permissions-security?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#built-in-monitoring-roles) on the target subscription.

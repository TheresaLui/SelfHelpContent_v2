# My log search alert fires with a delay

[Log alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log) run the queries provided by you against the data in your [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview) workspace or [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json) component and check if some threshold is met.

## **Recommended steps**

If you believe your log alert is triggering with a delay, the following steps might help you understand and resolve issues.

1. Data ingestion time in to Log Analytics might be impacting your alert rule
    - As Azure Log Analytics is a high scale data service that serves thousands of customers  sending terabytes of data each month, it is sometimes susceptible to a varying time delay for data ingestion. For more information, see [Data ingestion time in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-ingestion-time)
    - If the data queried by the alert rule is not yet (fully) ingested into Log Analytics, the alert rule might evaluate the condition as not met because of which alert was not triggered
    - To avoid missed alerts in such cases, log alerts are retried several times with an exponential wait time.
    - In such cases, when the condition is not met during the initial execution but on a retry, you might receive alerts with a delay.
    - If you need alerts with a lower latency, consider using [Metric alerts for Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-logs) for alerting on Heartbeat, Perf or Events tables

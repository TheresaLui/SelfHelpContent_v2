# My metric alert doesn't fire when it should have

[Metric alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview) monitor platform or custom metric values for your Azure resources and notify you if a metric breaches a threshold.

## **Recommended Steps**

If you believe your metric alert should have triggered but it did not, the following steps might help resolve the issue.

1. Review the alert rule configuration:

    - Check that **Aggregation type**, **Aggregation granularity (period)** and **Threshold value** or **Sensitivity** specified in the metric alert rule condition are what you want
    - Please also mind the Dynamic Thresholds advanced settings, if used, as **Number of violations** may filter alerts and **Ignore data before** can impact how the thresholds are calculated

If they are not what you want, edit the rule to match what you want.

**Note:** Dynamic Thresholds requires at least 3 days of data before becoming active and chart will display continuous historical thresholds, which include thresholds updates over time.

2. Review the [fired alerts list](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring/AzureMonitoringBrowseBlade/alertsV2) to see if there any alerts fired for your metric alert rule. If you can see the alert in the portal, then the issue might be with notifications:

    - Check if proper actions/notifications were configured for the alert rule using an associated [action group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups) or an [action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-action-rules)
    - Check if you have any rules that might prevent receiving emails from [Azure emails](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups#action-specific-information)
    - Check if your web hook receiver accepts the [payload sent by metric alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-near-real-time#payload-schema)
    - Check if you have any [action rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-action-rules) that suppress notifications for your alert rule

3. Check if the monitor condition of the alert rule is fired/activated. An alert rule that is in a fired/activated condition will not trigger additional alerts until it's resolved/deactivated, to reduce noise in case of flapping conditions. The alert rule will automatically get resolved/deactivated when the alert condition is not met for three consecutive periods.

4. If you have selected some [dimension values for a metric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview#using-dimensions), the alert will monitor each individual metric time-series (as defined by a combination of dimension values) for breaching the threshold. If you would like to also monitor the aggregate metric time-series (without any dimensions selected), then configure an additional alert rule on the metric without selecting dimensions.

5. If you are visualizing the metric condition using [Metrics chart](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring/AzureMonitoringBrowseBlade/metrics), ensure that:

    - The **Aggregation** in the metric chart is the same as **Aggregation type** in your alert rule
    - The **Time granularity** is set to be same as the **Aggregation granularity (period)** in your alert rule and not set to automatic

## I can't pick Guest OS namespace and metrics

Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets have two categories of metrics: **Virtual Machine Host** metrics that are collected by the Azure hosting environment, and **Guest OS (classic)** metrics that are collected by the [monitoring agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agents-overview) running on your virtual machines. You install the monitoring agent by enabling [Azure Diagnostic Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostics-extension-overview).

By default, Guest OS metrics are stored in Azure Storage account, which you pick from the **Diagnostic settings** tab of your resource. If Guest OS metrics aren't collected or metrics explorer cannot access them, you will only see the **Virtual Machine Host** metric namespace:

## **Recommended Steps**

 If you don't see **Guest OS** namespace and metrics in metrics explorer:

* Confirm that [Azure Diagnostic Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostics-extension-overview) is enabled and configured to collect metrics. NOTE: You cannot use [Log Analytics agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agents-overview#log-analytics-agent) (also referred to as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, or "MMA") to send **Guest OS** into a storage account.
* Ensure that **Microsoft.Insights** resource provider is [registered for your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-troubleshoot#microsoftinsights-resource-provider-isnt-registered-for-your-subscription)
* Verify that storage account isn't protected by the firewall. Azure portal needs access to storage account in order to retrieve metrics data and plot the charts.
* Use the [Azure storage explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) to validate that metrics are flowing into the storage account. If metrics aren't collected, follow the [Azure Diagnostics Extension troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostics-extension-troubleshooting#metric-data-doesnt-appear-in-the-azure-portal).

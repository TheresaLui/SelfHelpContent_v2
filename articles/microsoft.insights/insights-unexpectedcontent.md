# Webhook notification is not in the format I expected

There are various kinds of alerts in Azure Monitor, and each has a different webhook payload format. Check the expected payload format for each alert type below. The same payload format is sent when using the alerts to trigger a Logic App, a runbook, or an Azure Function.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If there was a sudden change in the webhook format, please check if the [common alert schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-common-schema#how-do-i-enable-the-common-alert-schema) was recently enabled (or disabled).
* If you are using webhooks to [integrate with Teams or Slack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups-logic-app), the endpoint expects the payload in a certain format which is different from what alerts provide
* If you are using custom webhook payloads functionality of log alerts, webhook payload will be in the format you specified for the alert rule

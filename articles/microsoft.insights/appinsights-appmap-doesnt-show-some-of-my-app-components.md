Application map displays your app components and dependencies. These app components are independently deployable parts of your distributed/microservices application and can be within the same AI resource or a different AI resource. Sometimes, they fail to show up on a map for various reasons below:

## **Recommended solutions**

### 1. **Grouped under a category say HTTP** 

* Sometimes the dependency is grouped as an external dependency and gets grouped under the category typically http. When you expand that category, you will be able to see it.
* To avoid this, ensure you have instrumented your app components using a supported SDK. Refer [to this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-platforms) for a list of supported SDKs.


### 2. **Select a longer time range** 

* Increase the time duration on the map to check if the component appears as it may not have been called in the last hour but might appear for a longer duration selected.


### 3. **App components is showing as an external dependency**  

* If the app component is showing as an external dependency (like “correlation” component in the map) then either you don’t have [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/resources-roles-access-control#to-provide-access-to-another-user) to the app resource or you need to instrument the app component by using the [supported SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-platforms). 

### 4. **Check Auto collected dependency**

* If you're missing a dependency, make sure it's in the list of [auto-collected dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/auto-collect-dependencies). If not, you can still track it manually with a [track dependency call](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics#trackdependency).

### 5. **Update Map Component**

* Check to see if the “update map components” button is failing to light up. This may happen for very large distributed applications. Reducing the time range you are querying for may help here.

# I am having problems with Activity Log Alerts API/CLI

You can create activity log alerts using the REST API or CLI as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-activity-log#azure-resource-template).

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are facing issues while trying to setup activity log alerts using the REST API or CLI, please use the following steps to troubleshoot:

1. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to author the alert. 
    * You are required to have the role of [monitoring contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/roles-permissions-security#built-in-monitoring-roles) on the target resource (or resource group/subscription) to author alerts on it.

2. Verify if the event that you wish to get alerted on is in the [list of supported ARM operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations).

3. Verify that you have used the appropriate syntax as defined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-activity-log#azure-resource-template).

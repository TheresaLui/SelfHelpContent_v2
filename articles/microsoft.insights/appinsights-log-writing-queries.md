You experience one of the following issues: **I am new to Log Analytics and need help writing a query** or **My query doesnâ€™t produce the expected result**

## **Recommended Steps**

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. If you are new to Kusto, there are a few options for you to get started:

* Take [free online courses on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kusto-query-language-kql-from-scratch). Microsoft has partnered with Pluralsight to provide free training that ranges from starting from scratch with KQL to advanced topics.
* Check out the [Log Analytics tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal) and [Getting started with Log Queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries). You can exercise in our [demo environment](https://portal.loganalytics.io/demo). It is loaded with plenty of sample data that you can use while learning to write queries.
* Explore suggested queries in Log Analytics. Pick and execute a query, and then try making small modifications. Use [Kusto Query Language Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849499) as a guide for syntax and available language constructs:

# I can't raise my daily cap above 0.0323 GB/day
## **Recommended steps**
To raise your daily cap beyond 0.0323 GB/day, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that your subscription type is not a Dreamspark subscription.  Dreamspark subscriptions cannot raise their cap beyond 0.0323 GB/day.
2. If your subscription is an MSDN or BizSpark subscription you will need to attach a payment instrument and [remove your spending limit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834519); it's important to remember to remove this **​indefinitely**, not just for the current billing period.

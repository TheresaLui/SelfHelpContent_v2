# My issue is not listed

Application Insights is an Application Performance Monitoring tool and the team that supports this are experts in the usage and configuration of that tool.<br>

If you've selected this option because the problem types were not specific enough or because you cannot find your specific one in the Service list here are some recommendations based on our experience with cases. This is also not a comprehensive list but the most common issues we see. Please note it is always best to select the support topic from the problem type and problem sub type drop downs as we can get the issue through our internal tools and triage much quicker.<br>

We also understand that sometimes you simply can't find a correct combination of Service and/or Problem Type so if these suggestions below do not help, please continue to open the case and our support team will help you find a resource.<br>

# I should have received an email for an alert that fired

## **Recommended Steps**

If you're certain that an alert has generated an event but has not sent an email notification you should check the following:

1. The email client SPAM settings (Outlook, Gmail)
2. The email server SPAM/quarantine settings (Exchange, O365, G Suite)
3. Any email security appliances (Barracuda, Cisco)
4. If the email is a distribution list, make sure it can receive external emails
5. Look for any unsubscribe email notifications, check with colleagues if the email is a distribution list

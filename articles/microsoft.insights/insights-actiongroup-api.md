# I am having issues managing metric alerts with API/CLI

Most alerts in Azure Monitor use [Action Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-action-groups) as the notification delivery mechanism.

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are running into issues creating/updating/deleting Action groups using REST API or Azure command line interface (CLI), the following steps may help resolve the issue:

1. Review the [REST API guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups/) to verify you are passing the all the parameters correctly
2. Review the [CLI guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/monitor/action-group?view=azure-cli-latest) for samples and usage

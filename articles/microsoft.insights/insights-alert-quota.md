# I want to increase my alerts or action groups quota

Some Alert types and action groups have service limits as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#monitor-limits)

## **Recommended Steps**

1. There are no limits on number of Log alerts and activity log alerts.

2. Provide the following information in the problem details to ensure faster resolution
    * Subscription Ids for which the quota limits have to be increased. If there are multiple subscriptions you need the limit increased, provide the full list.
    * Resource type for the quota increase: **Metric Alerts**, **Metric alerts (Classic)** or **Action groups**
    * To what number quota has to be increased to: For Metric Alerts and Metric Alerts(Classic), the maximum limit is 1000.

# I want to increase my alerts or action groups quota

Some alert types and action groups have service limits as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-monitor-limits).

## **Recommended Steps**

Provide the following information in the problem details to ensure faster resolution:

    * Subscription Ids for which the quota limits should be increased. If there are multiple subscriptions, provide the full list.
    * Resource type for the quota increase: **Metric Alerts**, **Metric Alerts (Classic)** or **Action groups**
    * The requested number of alert rules the quota should be increased

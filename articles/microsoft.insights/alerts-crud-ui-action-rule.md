# **Issue while creating, updating or deleting an action rule**
If you are trying to create, update, or delete an [action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-action-rules) in the portal, but receiving unexpected errors, follow these steps:

## **Recommended Steps**

### Are you receiving a permission error?

Ensure you have the permissions to author the action rule. Usually, you would use the ["Monitoring Contributor"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitoring-contributor) built-in role.

### Have you configured all the action rules parameters correctly?

Follow the action rule documentation of explanation of each parameter.

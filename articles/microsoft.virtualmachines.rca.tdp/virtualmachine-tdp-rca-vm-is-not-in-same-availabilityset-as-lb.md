# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because a load balancer has been configured but the load balancer is not in the same availability set as the virtual machine being deployed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Possible solutions:<br>

1. Move the VM into an availability set that the load balancer is configured for.<br>
2. [Combine a load balancer with availability sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability)<br>

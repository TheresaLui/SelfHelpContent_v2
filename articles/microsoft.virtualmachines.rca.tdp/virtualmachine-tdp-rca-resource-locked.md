<!--issueDescription-->
We detected that the operation on virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the resource is locked.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

You must unlock the resource add, delete, or modify it. In the **Settings** blade for the resource, resource group, or subscription, select **Locks**. Select the ellipsis and **Delete** from the available options.

If you do not see options to manage locks, you will need elevated rights to access them.

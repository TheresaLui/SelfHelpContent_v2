# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed for the following reason: enabling the availability set for accelerated networking is not possible as the cluster does not support that functionality.
<!--/issueDescription-->

When enabling Accelerated Networking for an availability set, the availability set must be deployed on an Accelerated Networking enabled cluster. If you are creating a VM with Accelerated Networking and encounter this issue, all VMs in an availability set or VMSS must be stopped/deallocated before enabling Accelerated Networking on any NIC. For additional information, refer to [Enable Accelerated Networking on existing using CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli#enable-accelerated-networking-on-existing-vms) and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell)<br>

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We detected that the start operation for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->myVM<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the availability zone **<!--$zonenumber--> <!--/$zonenumber-->** does not have the capacity to support its allocation.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

The Azure Availability Zone chosen in the deployment did not have the needed capacity to allocate the VM. Availability zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region that provide high availability to protect your applications and data from datacenter failures.<br>  

## **Recommended Steps**

We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try allocating the VM again as the issue might have been temporary and there now could be sufficient resources for the allocation. If that doesn't work, you have the following options:<br>

- Resize the VM to a size that is currently available in your region. If you are using an older VM product, consider newer versions.
- Deploy a new VM to another availability zone in the region.

To determine available sizes in the Azure portal, select the VM and under **Settings**, choose **Size**. On the **Size** blade, you can view available sizes and use filter options.<br>

## **Recommended Documents**

-  To determine sizes using PowerShell, use the [Get-AzComputeResourceSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azcomputeresourcesku) command, for Azure CLI see the [az vm list-skus](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-list-skus) command, for the REST API see the [Resource SKUs - List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list) operation.
- See [Resize virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resize-virtual-machines/) for a conceptual overview on working with VM sizes, availability sets, availability zones, and regions.
- See [Resize a Windows VM not in an availability set](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/resize-vm#resize-a-windows-vm-not-in-an-availability-set) to resize a VM that's not in an availability set using PowerShell.

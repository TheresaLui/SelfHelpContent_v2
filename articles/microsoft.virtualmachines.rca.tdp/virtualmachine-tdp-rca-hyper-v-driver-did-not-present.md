# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed and the platform detected that the Hyper-V didn’t present a DVD drive to the VM. One common cause is that the image has an older Linux kernels installed, the Linux Integration Service drivers are not installed or outdated. 
<!--/issueDescription-->

If redeploying the VM does not resolve the issue, please read these additional documents:<br>

* To understand the minimum kernel versions required for a Linux VM in Azure, [please read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4041171).<br>

* To understand the minimum Linux Integration Service (LIS) drivers required, follow the directions in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-generic#linux-kernel-requirements).<br>

We recommend that you update any custom images that may be used in future deployments to avoid this issue. If this is a Marketplace image, we recommend reaching out to the publisher directly.<br>

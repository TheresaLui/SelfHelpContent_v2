#We detected a recent issue with your deployment attempt:

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your deployment failed for <!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->:** at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. Provisioning of this image failed. One common cause is that the image was configured as generalized but the VM was deployed as specialized. Alternatively, the image was configured as specialized but the VM was deployed as generalized.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Please deploy with both as generalized or both as specialized. Additionally, please review the below documentation on specialized and generalized images.<br>

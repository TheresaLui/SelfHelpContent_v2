# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed for the following reason: a virtual machine with Accelerated Networking Enabled nics cannot be added to an existing non-accelerated networking Availability Set.
<!--/issueDescription-->

To work around this issue, please deploy the virtual machine into an Availability Set that has accelerated networking already enabled.<br>

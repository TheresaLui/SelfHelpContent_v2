# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the disk size specified in the deployment will result in a smaller size than the original size of the VHD.
<!--/issueDescription-->

To work around this issue, please deploy a disk size that is equal or larger than the original size of the disk being deployed.

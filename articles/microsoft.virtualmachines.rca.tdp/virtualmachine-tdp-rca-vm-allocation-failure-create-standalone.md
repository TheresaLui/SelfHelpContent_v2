# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an allocation failure

<!--issueDescription-->
We detected that a create operation for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->myVM<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** encountered an allocation failure.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

The region this VM is associated with did not have enough capacity at the time to support its allocation.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

We apologize for the inconvenience. Try creating the VM again as the issue might have been temporary and there now could be sufficient resources for the allocation. If that doesn't work, consider choosing another VM size that is currently available in your region. If you are using an older VM product, consider newer versions.<br> 

To search and browse the virtual machines by region, choose `virtual machines` in an interactive query that Azure provides [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines).<br>

## **Recommended Documents**

- To determine sizes using PowerShell, use the [Get-AzComputeResourceSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azcomputeresourcesku) command, for Azure CLI see the [az vm list-skus](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-list-skus) command, for the REST API see the [Resource SKUs - List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list) operation.
- For a conceptual overview on working with VM sizes, availability sets, availability zones, and regions, see [Resize virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resize-virtual-machines/).

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue 

<!--issueDescription-->
We detected that the operation **<!--$OperationName-->operationName<!--/$OperationName-->** on virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->myVirtualMachine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the requested VM size is not available in the current hardware cluster where the Azure Availability Set **<!--$avsetname-->myAvailabilitySet<!--/$avsetname-->** is created.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

An Azure Availability Set is created on a specific hardware cluster based upon the first VM using it. Each subsequent VM added must be compatible with the VM sizes supported in that hardware cluster. By having this constraint, high availability is maintained.<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience in not being able to use your desired VM size, but have a couple of options depending on your flexibility with SKU options for the availability set:

•	If you are not limited to a specific SKU, you can query the available VM sizes for your current availability set and pick a suitable size from the results by using the PowerShell [Get-AzVMSize](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvmsize) command. See [Check for available VM sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets#check-for-available-vm-sizes) where you can run the command directly. 

•	If you are limited to a specific SKU, you must create a new availability set based on the VM that matches your required SKU. Afterwards, you may need to deallocate the existing availability set.

In addition, you can consider Azure Availability Zones which provides high availability by having VMs grouped in one or more physical locations within an Azure Region.<br>

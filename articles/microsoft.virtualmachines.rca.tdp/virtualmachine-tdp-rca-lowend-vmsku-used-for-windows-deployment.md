# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the deployment is using extra-small size for the deployment and Windows is unable to complete the initial provisioning successfully due to the resource limitations of an extra-small instance.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## Resolution
When creating and deploying the virtual machine, please specify a larger size in order for the deployment to succeed and for the virtual machine to complete initial startup.<br>

For information about other VM types and sizes in Azure for Windows, see [Windows VM sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes).<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.<br>

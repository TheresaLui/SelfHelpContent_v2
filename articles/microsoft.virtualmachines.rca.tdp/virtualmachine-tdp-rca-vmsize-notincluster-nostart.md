# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We detected that the start operation for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->myVM<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed because the availability set **<!--$avsetname--> <!--/$avsetname-->** does not support the new SKU Size that you requested.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

The availability set that this virtual machine was associated with does not support its current VM size. The VM or availability set must be resized for the start operation to succeed.<br>

An Azure Availability Set is created on a specific hardware cluster based upon the first VM using it. Each subsequent VM added must be compatible with the VM sizes supported in that hardware cluster. By having this constraint, high availability is maintained. In this case, the requested resize size is not available in its current availability set.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

We apologize for any inconvenience in not being able to use your desired VM size, but have a couple of options depending on your flexibility with SKU options for the availability set:

- Choose a size that is included in your availability set
- Choose a size that is not included in your availability set. However, you must first deallocate all the VMs in the availability set. This is because Azure must deallocate all the VMs in the availability set to reconfigure it to support the new size.<br>

See [Resize virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resize-virtual-machines/) for considerations on working with VM sizes, availability sets, regions, and hardware. 

For PowerShell examples, see [Resize a Windows VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/resize-vm).<br>

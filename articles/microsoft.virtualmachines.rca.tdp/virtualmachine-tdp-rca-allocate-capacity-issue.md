# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed due to the requested VM size not being available in the region that was requested.
<!--/issueDescription-->

It is important to **highlight this is not a quota issue.** The servers in Azure datacenters are partitioned into clusters. Normally, an allocation request is attempted within a datecenter with no issues, but it's possible that certain constraints from the allocation request force the Azure platform to attempt the request in a specific set of clusters. Due to the natural fluctuation of capacity within a datacenter, it was not possible to meet the constraints defined at the time the deployment was initiated.<br>

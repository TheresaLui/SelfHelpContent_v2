# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed due to the deployment having a Marketplace plan defined when it is not required. Validation within the platform detected the plan information being present.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The deployment does not require the Marketplace plan information and needs to be removed. To work around this issue, please remove from your deployment action the marketplace plan information and redeploy.<br>

|:-------------:|-------------	|
| Publisher 		| The organization that created the image. Examples: Canonical, MicrosoftWindowsServer |
|  Offer        |  Name of a group of related images created by a publisher. Examples: Ubuntu Server, WindowsServer |
| SKU 					| An instance of an offer, such as a major release of a distribution. Examples: 16.04-LTS, 2016-Datacenter |
|  Version 			|The version number of an image SKU|

To view an image's purchase plan information, run  [*Get-AzureRMVMImage*](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/get-azurermvmimage)(PS) or [*az vm image show *](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/image#az_image_show)(CLI) to obtain the above properties.<br>

Example:<br>

	$version = "2016.127.20170406"
	Get-AzureRMVMImage -Location $locName -Publisher $pubName -Offer $offerName -Skus $skuName -Version $version

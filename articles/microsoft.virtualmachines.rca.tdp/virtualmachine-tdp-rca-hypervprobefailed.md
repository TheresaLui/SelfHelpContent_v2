# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that the deployment for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** initiated at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** failed. This problem occurs when a Linux virtual machine does not communicate with the Azure host within a set amount of time. The communication failure occurred in this deployment because of a known issue relating to incompatible hyper-call timing parameters in the Hyper-V drivers found in older Linux kernels. Your virtual machine is most likely running an older Linux kernel.
<!--/issueDescription-->

To understand how to self-mitigate and understand the kernel versions that may be impacted, [please read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4041171).<br>

Microsoft also recommends updating any custom images that may be used in future deployments to avoid this issue.<br>

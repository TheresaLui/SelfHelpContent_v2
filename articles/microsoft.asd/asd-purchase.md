# ASD/Purchasing

## **Recommended steps**

If you can't buy an App Service Domain in the Azure Portal, this can happen because of the following reasons:
* There's no credit card on the Azure subscription, or the credit card is invalid.
Solution: Add a valid credit card to your subscription.
* You're not the subscription owner, so you don't have permission to purchase a domain.
Solution: Assign the Owner role to your account. Or contact the subscription administrator to get permission to purchase a domain.
* You have reached the limit for purchasing domains on your subscription. The current limit is 20.
Solution: To request an increase to the limit, 
* Your Azure subscription type does not support the purchase of an App Service domain. <br>
	Solution: Upgrade your Azure subscription to another subscription type, such as a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. Click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-domain-ssl-certificates#you-cant-purchase-a-domain) for more info. 
 
* Avoid domain from expiration. Click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/custom-dns-web-site-buydomains-web-app#renew-the-domain) for more info.

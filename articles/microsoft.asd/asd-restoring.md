# ASD/Restoring an Accidentally Deleted Domain

## **Recommended Steps**

To restore an accidentally deleted Azure App Service Domain:

* If **within 30 days from deletion date**: You can buy the same domain again on Azure portal under the same subscription (make sure you type the exact domain name in the search text box). You will not be charged again for this domain. Make sure to complete this by the 30th day after the deletion.
* If **after 30 days from deletion date**: Continue creating a support ticket and provide the exact date and time (with time zone) of the deletion.

# Transact and Manage Transact and Manage Windows Autopilot device setup

The Windows Autopilot feature allows you to create custom profiles to apply to customer devices.

## **Recommended Steps**

The following profile and device management permissions and limitations apply:
* CSP partners can continue to manage Autopilot profiles for existing customers with whom they have reseller relationships, even if the customers have removed the partner's delegated administration privileges.
* You can manage existing devices for your customers that you have added.
* You can't manage devices your customer has uploaded to Microsoft Store for Business or the Microsoft Intune Portal.

If you get an error message while trying to upload the .csv file, check the format of the file. You can use the hardware hash only, or the OEM name, serial number, and model (in that column order), or the Windows Product ID. If the problem persists please include a [debug file](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/report-problems-with-partner-center) in your support ticket.

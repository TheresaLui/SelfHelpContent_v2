# Partner Center Incentives: Incentives roles and user management

## **Recommended Steps**

To add or manage users within the Partner Center Dashboard, you must be the ***Global*** or ***Account Administrator***. As the ***Global*** or ***Account Admin***, you will be able to assign permissions to either existing or new users. This document includes steps on how to add new users and assign permissions.

**Important**: The Incentive Administrator is the only user who can enroll in an incentive program. The Incentive Administrator must be assigned for each MPN ID location by program or can be assigned for the entire organization which will allow the user to act on enrollments for all MPN ID locations within the organization, following the MPN membership structure. If there is no Incentive Administrator for your particular location, the Global Administrator and Account Administrator must assign one.

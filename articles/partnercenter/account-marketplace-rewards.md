# How to manage Marketplace Rewards in Partner Center


## **Recommended Steps**

- First, please check if your Azure AD tenant is different from the one that you used for MPN onboarding. If yes, then you will need to associate that Azure AD tenant with your company's Partner Global Account (PGA).
- To associate an Azure AD tenant with the PGA of your company:

  - As either the global admin or account admin, sign into the PGA in Partner Center
  - Select **Settings** (on top-right), **Partner settings**, **Tenants**
  - Select **Associate another Azure AD tenant** and select the Azure AD tenant you want to associate with the PGA
  - Add username and password of any user in the Azure AD tenant you want to associate and select **Submit**
  - Sign out of Partner Center and then sign in using the username and password for the tenant you just associated to the PGA
  - You will now be able to see the Commercial Rewards Marketplace program information in the left navigation menu

# Invoices
Below are documents to help you understand how partner center invoices work.

## **Recommended Steps**
- You can find your invoice on the Billing page of the dashboard. From the Partner Center menu, select "Billing".
- On the "Billing" page, select the invoice you want to download
- You can find a link to your latest invoice at the top of the page under "Account balance" as of last invoice date
You can find previous invoices in the "Billing history" section. Choose the appropriate year, then select the drop-down arrow next to that Billing period. Select the link next to "Invoices" (.pdf) to download that period's invoice
- For usage-based and license-based billing, your invoice is available within two (2) days of your selected billing date in UTC time.
- For one-time and recurring billing, the billing period is aligned to calendar month and the invoice/reconciliation files will be available no later than 8th of every month.

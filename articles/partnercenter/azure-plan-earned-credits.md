# Partner earned credit for managed services in Azure

Resources and information about partner earned credit for managed services in Azure.

## **Recommended Steps**

* As a CSP Partner, you should verify that you have an active MPN agreement and valid [RBAC roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec) assigned, to receive earned credit for the Azure assets you manage for your customers. Please note that Partner Earned Credits are not of monetary value, but are provided to eligible Partners in the form of discounts, visible in the following month’s recon file.
* If you are an Indirect provider, you should verify that either yourself or your indirect reseller (or both) have 24x7 operational control and management of the customer's Azure resources in CSP
* If the customer has removed your RBAC roles as a CSP Partner on the Azure subscription, please ask the customer to provide a [RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-roles-perms-pec) permission eligible for PEC, by following the guidance on how to [Reinstate admin privileges for Azure CSP subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/revoke-reinstate-csp)
* The monthly invoice amount is net of partner earned credit. You can review the PEC details on your [monthly recon file](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/daily-rated-usage-recon-files)
* If you are using Guest / User access, please verify that you have associated your MPN ID successfully to the user or service principal in the customer tenant. Refer to [Link a partner ID to your Azure accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id)**(Note: this action is not applicable / needed for AOBO – Access on behalf of - type access)**

# Partner Center Incentives: Plan submission

## **Recommended Steps**

**How to submit a plan**

You must create and submit your plan by the last day of the program year. If necessary, you can edit and resubmit the plan for an additional 90 days after that, but the plan must be created and initially submitted during the program year.

**NOTE:** You can only create one plan per fund type for a program year. 

1. Sign into the [Partner Center dashboard](http://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard)
2. Under **Incentives** in the left nav, select **Program**, and then select your program.
3. On the **Program** page, locate the appropriate market for your plan, and then select **Create plan**
4. On the **New plan** page, complete the required fields:

	* Currency is the value you want to have the plan reflect
	* Reviewer email should be the Microsoft email address of your account manager
	* Note that only one plan can be created per MPN ID, fund, program, and period. Select Save.
	
5.	On the plan’s status page, review the information displayed. Select **Edit** to update any of the information.
6.	When the information on this page is correct, select **New campaign**
7.	Complete the required fields on the **New campaign** page, and then select **Save**
8.	On the status page, select **New activity**.
9.	On the **New activity** page, complete the required fields. You can select multiple countries. When you’re finished, select **Save**. 
10.	On the status page, review your information again. Once you submit a plan you cannot edit it. When you’re finished, select **Submit**, and then select **Confirm**.
 
Your plan has now been submitted. Microsoft will notify your Incentive admin when it’s been approved or if we need additional information. You can view the plan’s progress in the Status window of the status page.

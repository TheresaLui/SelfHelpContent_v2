# This is a sample title

This is a brief paragraph about the problem. It can be as simple as "Most users are able to resolve their [topic] issue using the steps below", or a more detailed outline of the issue being experienced. Please make sure that this section has at least one blank line both before and after it. Please also make sure clientIds='partnercenter' is in the metadata section for all solutions/scoping questions

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This is the first step

2. This is a step with no link, blade, or instructions. Note that because the next line is a continuation of the list, no <br> (br) break is needed.

3. As in the example above, this step contains multiple sentences. When a step has multiple complete sentences, the use of a period to end each sentence is acceptable.

4. This step does not have multiple sentences, so no period is required at the end

5. Please make sure each list element has a blank line both before and after it

6. *Use a single asterisk before and after the text to italicize*

7. **Use a set of double asterisks before and after the text to bold**

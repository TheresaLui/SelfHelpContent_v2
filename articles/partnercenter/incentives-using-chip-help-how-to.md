# Partner Center Incentives: CHIP Help and How-To

## **Recommended Steps**
The Channel Incentives Platform (CHIP) provides access to incentives data for specific Microsoft Channel Incentives programs and shows updated earning details for selling Microsoft products.

When first enrolled, Microsoft sends a Welcome e-mail which explains the [CHIP](https://channelincentives.microsoft.com/chipui/landingpage.mvc/home) login process. A Microsoft Account (formerly Windows Live ID) is required for [CHIP](https://channelincentives.microsoft.com/chipui/landingpage.mvc/home) access.

Following the welcome e-mail, you are sent a Unique Invitation Code, via an Invitation Code Email. You need to use both to gain access to [CHIP](https://channelincentives.microsoft.com/chipui/landingpage.mvc/home).

Note that there is no requirement for you to re-enroll for [CHIP](https://channelincentives.microsoft.com/chipui/landingpage.mvc/home) access from one period to the next.

# Customer Education qualification

Information about selling and managing qualifications for education customers.

## **Recommended Steps**

Partners now can correct customer account information and resubmit for vetting for cases where the customer was denied. For full details see step-by-step instructions on how to do this in the updated [Creating an education customer in Partner Center guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/sell-to-education-customers).

To minimize any delays in the vetting process, please follow these instructions:

* To reduce any delays in the investigation of vetting failures for legitimate entries, please ensure to enter customer data that is as **accurate** and as **complete** as possible. Do not enter in test or dummy data.
* Review the [Creating an education customer in Partner Center guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/sell-to-education-customers) and [Add a new customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/add-a-new-customer) documenting what is required when creating a new education customer in Partner Center.

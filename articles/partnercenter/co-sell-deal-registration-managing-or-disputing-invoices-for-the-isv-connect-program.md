# Partner Center Cosell Deal Registration Managing or disputing invoices for the ISV Connect program

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Invoices will be received by the partner via the email provided during deal registration. If you have received an invoice, it is because you have registered a deal for a solution associated with the ISV Connect program. See links below for more information related to this program. 
2. If you have an issue with the invoice amount, currency, calculation, or general questions, please submit a support ticket and reference your Deal ID,  invoice ID, and specific questions related to your invoice. 
3. If you do not understand why you are receiving an invoice at all, it may be because you have registered a deal that is not yet closed with the customer or you are trying to submit a lead. In this case, please submit a support ticket with the details of your issue including deal ID and Invoice ID.

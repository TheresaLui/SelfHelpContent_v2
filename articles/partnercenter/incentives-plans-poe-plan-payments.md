# Partner Center Incentives: Plan payments

## **Recommended Steps**

**Plan Payments**

Microsoft pays you every month based on your earnings and the limits of your plan. Payments are made on the 15th day of the following month. 

For example, if your plan is approved for $10,000, and you earned $5,000 in the month of April, you will receive $5,000 on May 15th. 

Under that same plan, if you earn $15,000 in the month of April, youâ€™ll receive $10,000 on May 15th because $10,000 was the limit for your plan. To receive more payment, you need to raise the limit of your plan for the next month.

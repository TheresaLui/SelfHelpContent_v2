# Azure applications - migration

The migration of Azure application offers from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center will take place during November and December 2019.  

During the migration:
* Your customers will still be able to find and acquire your Azure application offers (solution templates and managed applications)
* Your offers will be in the same state in Partner Center as they were in Cloud Partner Portal (draft, preview, live)

After the migration:
* Your Azure application offers will still be visible in Cloud Partner Portal, but read-only
* You'll manage your Azure application offers in Partner Center

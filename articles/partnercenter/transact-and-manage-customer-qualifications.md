# Transact and Manage - Customer qualifications

Requirements and process for purchasing a qualified Education, GCC or Non-profit offer via CSP channel.

## **Recommended Steps**

Partners can only sell special offers to customers if they meet certain criteria.
Qualified offers are mutually exclusive, so if you have a customer who has purchased an offer of one type on an existing AAD tenant (through any transaction), you will not be able to purchase with a different qualification for that tenant.

1. Non-Profit - Must have a non-profit Azure Active Directory tenant. Learn more about nonprofit special offers. Customer must sign up through the Microsoft nonprofit program to be eligible.
2. Education - Must be a qualified education customer.
3. US Government -To sell Azure, enroll using the Microsoft US Government Cloud Validation form. To sell license-based subscriptions to government, the customer must be validated via GCC customer validation.

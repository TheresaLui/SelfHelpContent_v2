# Request for MFA exception

Partner Center is mandating partners to complete MFA verification for specific partner-related scenarios. Partners can request for technical exception to suppress MFA verification if they are encountering issues with Microsoft Online Services and there are no feasible solution or workaround.

Before submitting a request for technical exception, please review all the documents listed below to understand what partner-related scenarios will trigger MFA verification, what constitutes a valid reason for technical exception, and information required when submitting an exception. After submission, click ‘Yes’ below to proceed with submitting an exception request.

After the request is submitted, Microsoft will provide a response within 3 business days.

# Partner Center Metered Billing Wrong usage sent for SaaS offer
 
## **Recommended Steps**
If you sent the incorrect usage to Microsoft and this did or will result in under charge of the customer, Microsoft will not initiate a bill to the customer for under-reported usage or pay you for that usage. You will have to bear the loss of revenue due to under-reporting.

If one of the following cases applies, you can open a support ticket to request refund or billing adjustment for your customers:

* You confirmed that one of the anomalies we found is a real issue and the incorrect usage would result in **overcharge** of the customer
* You discover that you sent incorrect usage to us and the incorrect usage would result in **overcharge** of the customer
* You would like to request a refund for the charge of your customerâ€™s metered billing usage

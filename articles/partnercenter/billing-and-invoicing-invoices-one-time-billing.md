# Billing and Invoicing Invoices one-time billing (software, Azure reserved instance)

## **Recommended Steps**

Your bill for purchases of Azure plan, Azure Reservations, Software, and Marketplace products will be generated in your customer's currency. This means that if you have customers who use different billable currencies, youâ€™ll receive a separate invoice for each customer currency type. For more information, see [onetime and recurring](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-billing).

For the one-time and recurring billing, the billing period is aligned to the calendar month, and your invoice and reconciliation files will be available no later than the 8th of every month. For more information, see [Azure Plan billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-billing).

To view your current billing status, invoices, and reconciliation files, use the following procedure:

1. Sign in to the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. On the left-hand menu, select **Billing**, and then select **Recurring and one-time purchases**.
3. On the billing status page, select an invoice or reconciliation file to view more detailed information.

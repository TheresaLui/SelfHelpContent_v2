# Change your billing info

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are the global admin, billing admin, or admin agent, you can change the address that appears on your CSP invoice in your **Billing profile**. To change the company name on your invoice a Global Admin should provide the following documentation in the support ticket:

* This **[form](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/mpn/csp-legal-entity-name-change-ww-eng-aug2017.docx)** duly completed and signed (legal name change form with physical signature, scanned/pdf copy for further review);
* Company Registration Certificate (as per MCRA/MPA))/Certificate of Incorporation on change name;
* Tax Registration Certificate showing the new tax/VAT registration number

**NOTE: Company Name cannot be changed if it results from a company merge/acquisition. In that case a new CSP account with new MPA signature is required.**

If you are not receiving "Invoice ready" notification emails, check your preferred email address in [My preferences](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/engagement/preference).

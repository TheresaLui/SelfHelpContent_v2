# Pricelists
Review the recommended steps and documents before submitting a service request about price lists.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Ensure you have the proper permissions when accessing the price list files. All pricing files can be exported from the **Pricing and offers** page in partner center but only **Global Administrators** and **Admin Agents** have access. 
- **Indirect Resellers** should work with their **Indirect Providers** for questions about pricing.

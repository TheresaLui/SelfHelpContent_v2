# Partner Center Incentives: Claim payments

## **Recommended Steps**

**When will I get the payment for the approved co-op claim?**
* Payments will be made within **45 business days** of the **approval date**. 
* If the program needs a tax invoice, payments will be made within **30 days after tax invoice is approved**.

**Why are my co-op claim payments made in two different currencies?**
* When co-op funds are earned from different Microsoft entities, payments are made in the local currency of each respective entity.  

**Why was I paid in a currency other than my co-op claim currency?**
* Every incentive program has a bank profile that was created during setup. The currency specified in that profile is the currency in which youâ€™ll be paid.

# Transact and Manage - Transfer of Azure Plan (17G) between partners

## **Recommended Steps**

- Transfer of Azure plan subscriptions from one direct billing CSP partner to another can be initiated via Partner center by the future or new partner using the self-service tool.
- Transfer requests must be accepted by the current partner within 30 days of the request or it will expire.
- After the request is accepted, billing ownership for the subscriptions is immediately transferred to the future partner, and all parties receive notifications of the transfer.

The customer should refer to the relevant cancellation terms in their agreement with the source partner, and work with the source partner to cancel their agreement in alignment with those terms.

# Partner Center Incentives: Managing customer associations

## **Recommended Steps**

**Checking the status of your CPOR association claim**

You may check the status of your CPOR association claim at any time utilizing the [Customer Associations Dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/incentives/claims/associations). 

Below are the reasons why your claim status might be **Partner Action Required** or **Rejected**: 

* **Partner Action Required** - Microsoft has reviewed your CPOR association claim PoE and needs more information related to your PoE for the products/workloads you have claimed. You have 5 business days to provide requested info and resubmit your claim or it will be rejected. Below are potential reasons why additional information may be needed:
	1. **Missing All PoE** – PoE is missing due to incorrect file uploaded or not pertaining to CPOR association claim
	2. **Missing Customer Acknowledgement** – Customer signature is not on the PoE
	3. **Missing or Old Dates** – Dates on PoE are missing or old in relation to the claim
	4. **Missing Partner Solution/Service** – The description of work you have completed is insufficient or not included in the document
	5. **Missing Products** - PoE doesn’t include a product or workload being claimed for
	
* **Rejected** - Your PoE was insufficient, or you did not respond within 5 business days per the PoE review guidelines, and the claim has been denied. Below are the 3 most common reasons your claim may have been rejected:
	1. **Partner request** - Partners can request to have their association rejected. This is mostly used when the partner has created a CPOR association claim by mistake utilizing an incorrect MPN, chosen an incorrect Activity.
	2. **Customer Decline** - Once the CPOR association claim has gone through the PoE approval process successfully, its status changes to Approved while the customer is provided the opportunity to deny consent of the association. If the customer denies consent, then the association will be rejected. 
	3. **Insufficient Proof of Execution** - Proof of Execution is required for every CPOR association. After your CPOR association claim is submitted, Microsoft reviewers will take up to 5 days to review your PoE and request any additional information needed via Comments section of the claim. If the provided information is insufficient, your CPOR association claim will be rejected.


**How do I edit my CPOR association claim?**
You have the ability to edit specific fields in your CPOR association claim. You may be asked to remove product(s)/workload(s) if the reviewers provide guidance that the PoE submitted is insufficient. In order to edit, your CPOR association claim must be in Submitted or Partner Action Required states. 
Fields you may edit:
* MPN
* Products 
* Customer and Partner contact information
* Add additional PoE and commentary 

**How do I dispute a CPOR association claim status?**
Submit a support request in Parnter Center and provide the support team the following information:
* MPN ID
* Incentive Program Name 
* CPOR association claim ID 
* Product: For Business Applications, provide the Dynamics products and subscriptions. For M365, provide workloads. 
* Customer Tenant ID
* Details of the issue

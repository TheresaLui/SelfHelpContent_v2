# Account settings - Onboarding to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)


## **Recommended Steps**
Before you proceed, we **highly recommend** you read  [MPA FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/mpa-indirect-provider-faq) to understand your MPN and CSP account structure in Partner Center and other common questions to help you with this onboarding.
If you want to enroll as **CSP Indirect Reseller** and working with an Indirect Provider (or Distributor), this is not right topic for you. Refer to [How to enroll as an Indirect reseller](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/support/csp/servicerequests/create?stage=2&topicid=7edb156d-e775-c0f0-2943-1eac0738046a).

1. To get started as new CSP Indirect Reseller, [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center#enroll-as-an-indirect-reseller-in-the-cloud-solution-provider-program).
2. [Download](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/mpn/migrate-pmc-pc-mpa-guide.pptx) the step-by-step guide to migrate your PMC account to PC. It also includes troubleshooting steps.
3. To verify your MPN account is in Partner Center, [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/microsoft-partner-agreement#verify-your-mpn-id-is-active-and-migrated-to-partner-center)
4. If you don’t have an MPN account or ID, you need to join the Microsoft Partner Network program first, [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account)
5. For help on which MPN ID to associate while enrolling into CSP Direct Bill program or create a new MPN location(MPN ID), [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/manage-locations#view-your-mpn-locations)
6. To accept Microsoft Partner Agreement in Partner Center, login to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/dashboard/overview) using Global Admin credentials. You can confirm if the Microsoft Partner Agreement has already been signed from [Agreement](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/settings/agreements) or the banner notification on the CSP Overview page. 
7. If you already have a CSP Direct bill account but having trouble with the account verification step, [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/verification-responses).

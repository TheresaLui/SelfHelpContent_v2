# MSFT Bank Details for CSP Payments

## **Recommended Steps**

Below you will find forms that contain MSFT bank details needed for CSP wire transfer payments for all accepted currencies.

Unfortunately we are unable to fulfill any request to sign partners' customized forms.

Microsoft is not a vendor to the customer, but instead a service provider, therefore providing a Certificate of Insurance is not required either.

We have a variety of resources available below regarding Microsoft Company Information, Governance, Business Conduct, and our Compliance Program. The customer may find these to be useful to their needs.

# Partner Center Incentives: Payout and tax profile issues

## **Recommended Steps**

Before you can receive payment for your incentive programs for a particular MPN location, you must complete your enrollment by associating a valid payout and tax profile with the program and MPN location. Microsoft will use this payout and tax profile to issue payments. You may be allowed to use electronic bank transfer or a credit note for payment, depending on the rules of the incentive program.

**Note:** If you need help identifying the correct tax information, contact the appropriate government sources in your country. 
For partner companies in the United States, if you require information on completing the W8 or W9 forms, the following addresses take you to the IRS site:
* [IRS W8 information](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8.pdf)
* [IRS W9 information](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw9.pdf)


**Payout and tax profile frequently asked questions**

1. **Who can create/ update payout and tax profiles for my organization?**

	* Users who have incentive admin role in Partner Center for the relevant incentive program and MPN location can update and see the payout and tax profiles for the organization.

2. **How long does it take for Microsoft to approve my pending payout and/or tax profiles?**

	* Validation can take up to 48 hours. During this time, your profile status on the Overview page will show as Validating enrollment. Once the process is complete, the status will show as either Enrolled if successful, or Action Required – Update Payment and/or tax details if necessary.

3. **How do I know if I have completed my payout and tax profile correctly?**

	* The status of your enrollment is displayed on the Overview page. When you’ve finished creating your profiles, your status will be Validating enrollment. Once we’ve validated your information, your status changes to Enrolled. This indicates that your payout and tax profile and your enrollment have been successfully completed. 

4. **Why do I need to update my tax profile to use it with a new incentive program?**

	* We pay out incentives from different locations depending on the incentive type. These differing locations may require additional tax information, based on the incentive program rules, to process correctly.

5. **How do I provide/ update my payout and/ or tax details?**
	
	* For detailed information on how to on how to update payment and tax details in Partner Center, see [How to create and manage bank and tax profiles in Partner Center](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4524534/how-to-create-and-manage-bank-and-tax-profiles-in-partner-center).

6. **Why don't I see my enrollments when I go to assign my payout and tax profile?**
	
	* Only incentive admins for your MPN location can create or manage payout and tax profiles. It could be that you don’t have the proper permissions, or that you’re logged in with an account that does not have these permissions. Contact your organization administrator to manage permissions for bank and tax.

7. **How can I delete a payment and/or tax profile?**
	
	* Microsoft currently does not support the option of deleting existing payout and tax profiles.

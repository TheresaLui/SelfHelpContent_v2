# Azure applications - visibility

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are trying to view an offer that is published only to the Preview step, make sure you are logged into the Azure portal with an Azure subscription that is included in your Preview audience.

Note that it can take up to 4 hours for the offer to be visible in the marketplace after the publishing step has completed.

If this step is taking longer than 4 hours, please log a support request.

# Partner Center API and Integration Support - Verifying Indirect reseller MPA status using AgreementStatus API

Changes to the existing API that enables indirect providers to verify the MPA acceptance status of their indirect resellers is planned for availability in November. 

* **If you are an existing MPA API user and do not make the [API updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/verify-indirect-reseller-mpa-status#csp-indirect-reseller-mpn-id-is-either-invalid-or-not-migrated-from-partner-membership-center-to-partner-center) you will experience API failures on November 1, 2020.**
* In the updated API, if the MPA has not been accepted by the indirect reseller, the indirect provider will be presented with an error code and error message. Check the [API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/verify-indirect-reseller-mpa-status#csp-indirect-reseller-mpn-id-is-either-invalid-or-not-migrated-from-partner-membership-center-to-partner-center) to view the “Learn More” links for each error code which will provide guides that can be shared with your indirect resellers for remediation.

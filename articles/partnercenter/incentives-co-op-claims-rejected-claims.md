# Partner Center Incentives: Rejected claims

## **Recommended Steps**
If the materials you provided with your co-op claim are determined to be insufficient, it will be rejected. You can view the reasons for the rejection in the **History** field of your co-op claims page. If you would like to dispute the rejection, use the following procedure:

**Dispute a rejected co-op claim**

1. Sign into the [Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).
2. Under **Incentives**, select **Co-op claims**.
3. Select the co-op claim you want to dispute. This will open the co-op claim page. 
4. At the bottom of the page, select **Dispute**.

The co-op claims validation team will review the claim within five business days. During this time, the status will show as **Disputed**. We may contact you to request additional information. When the review is complete, the validation team will update the status to either **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Partner Action Required**.

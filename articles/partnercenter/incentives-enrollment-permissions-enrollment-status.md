# Partner Center Incentives: Enrollment status

## **Recommended Steps**

**My incentives overview** shows the overall status of your incentive programs, as well as the status of each program at each location. This information includes total incentive earnings and payments since you enrolled in incentive programs.

Also included on this page are earnings and payments by location or program as well as any further actions you might need to take to enroll in a program at a specific location.

To access **My incentives overview**:

1. Sign into the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard)
2. Select **Incentives**, then **Overview** from the menu
3. View the earnings and payments summary at the top of the page and further details in the table below. You can also sort, group and expand the accompanying table:

	- To sort by column, select the column name
	- To group by program, select the **By program** tab above the table
	- To group by location, select the **By location** tab above the table
	- To view more details about enrollments within a specific group, select the chevron symbol at the end of a given row. This expands your view.

4. If further action is required to enroll in a program, this information will appear in the **Status** column. In this case, select the chevron symbol to learn about next steps you need to take.

You can learn more about enrollment statuses from Partner Center by accessing the Recommended Documents below.

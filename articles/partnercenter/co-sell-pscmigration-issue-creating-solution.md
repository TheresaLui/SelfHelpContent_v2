# Partner Center Issue creating or updating a solution assessment deal

## **Recommended Steps**
* If you are getting the error "Selected location is not applicable for solution assessment", then go to the location field next to Deal name in the deal details section and select the correct MPN location to view the solutions assessments. If you do not see your desired location(s) listed in the locations drop down, please reach out to your account administrator to request the '_Referrals admin_' role assignment for your desired location(s). You can verify your access by selecting '_My Profile > Partner Center permissions > Click here to view permissions_'.
* Solution Assessment deals can only be created by partners approved by the Solution Assessment business team.
* Only one solution assessment type can be added to a solution assessment deal.
* No other solutions can be added to a solution assessment type deal.
* Solution assessment type cannot be changed after deal creation.
* Incentive level will be added by Solution Assessment Specialist to the Microsoft card. It is not visible in the Partner deal details.

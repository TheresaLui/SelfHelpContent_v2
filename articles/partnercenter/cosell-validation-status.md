# Partner Center Ingestion - Co-sell validation status
 
## **Recommended Steps**

* Co-sell status can be found in Partner Center on the Offer Overview page

* You no longer need to contact us to nominate your offer for co-sell. After you complete all required fields on the Co-sell with Microsoft page and republish your offer, we will review your offer to determine if it meets the requirements for co-sell status.

* Providing information on the Co-sell with Microsoft tab is entirely optional. It is required to achieve [Co-sell Ready and IP Co-sell Incentivized status](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#3000-requirements-for-co-sell-status).

# Account settings - Enrollment and account creation

## **Recommended Steps**

## Verification Code not received during enrollment
*Check if you have “info” or “admin” in your email id, like admin@contoso.com , or email ids containing “email@...” , “marketing@..” , these kind of email ids are not supported to enroll into MPN program.
## OVDF Error 
*Continue to create a ticket and add the 715-XXXX error code in the ticket.
## LE name already exists error from Jarvis 
*Try updating the legal company name with a space “ “ or a “.”. This is a known issue during enrollment.
## IT department error 
*Request your IT admin on the Office 365 work account to run a PowerShell as given [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/troubleshoot-account-sign-n#if-the-it-department-has-turned-off-sign-up-for-partner-center). Once completed, you can use the Office 365 work account to enroll into MPN program.
## National Cloud or USGCC tenant error
*National cloud work account or Office 365 GCC government work accounts are not allowed to enroll into MPN program as MPN is a global program. Please use an Office 365 tenant on Global to enroll into MPN program.

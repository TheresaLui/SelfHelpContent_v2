# Account settings - Enrollment and account creation

## **Recommended Steps**

### Verification Code not received during enrollment
* Check if you have "info" or "admin" in your email id, like "admin@contoso.com" , or email ids containing "email@...", "marketing@.." , these kind of email ids are not supported to enroll into MPN program.

### OVDF Error 
* Continue to create a ticket and add the 715-XXXX error code in the ticket.

### LE name already exists error 
* Try updating the legal company name with a space " " or a ".". This is a known issue during enrollment.

### IT department error 
* Request your IT admin on the Office 365 work account to run a PowerShell as given [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/troubleshoot-account-sign-n#if-the-it-department-has-turned-off-sign-up-for-partner-center). Once completed, you can use the Office 365 work account to enroll into MPN program.

### National Cloud or USGCC tenant error
* National cloud work account or Office 365 GCC government work accounts are not allowed to enroll into MPN program as MPN is a global program. Please use an Office 365 tenant on Global to enroll into MPN program.

### Account verification in Rejected
* If your account verification is "Rejected", you need to fix it by providing more documentation. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/verification-responses) on documentation.

# Transact and Manage - Upgrade Windows 10 Home customers to Windows 10 Education

Starting November 1, 2020, CSPs who have purchased Microsoft 365 A3/A5 or Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 subscriptions can help their Education customers upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education, which is designed for both the classroom and remote learning.

CSP Partners can help their customers upgrade by [submitting a support request on customer's behalf](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/report-problems-on-behalf-of-a-customer). Microsoft Support will review the request to ensure that your customer qualifies; once the request is approved, they will provide the Windows 10 Pro Education key to the customer.

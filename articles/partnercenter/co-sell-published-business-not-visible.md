# Published business profile not visible in Partner Finder


## **Recommended Steps**

- It takes 24 hours for your business profile to appear on Microsoft solution provider webpage after publishing
- Try to search for your profile by company name which is available in the advanced filters after searching any anything
- Your profile may not be available in the first page of search results potentially due to a lower rank compared to other profiles
- Try to search with the exact keywords that you have entered in the business profile and scroll to find the profile

If you are a CSP partner, your MPN ID is located on the [Partner profile](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/partnerprofile) page. If you are a MPN partner, your MPN ID is located in the [Partner Profile](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/connectedpartnerprofile) page.

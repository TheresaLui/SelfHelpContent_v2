# Partner Center Ingestion - Unable to migrate solutions
 
## **Recommended Steps**

Microsoft is moving the publishing experience to the [commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/overview). This will provide a simplified offer publishing to co-sell through Microsoft's three channels by centralizing offer creation and management in Partner Center, where you are already managing your relationship with Microsoft.

**Note:** To continue co-selling with Microsoft, ensure the migrated solutions are published to the commercial marketplace.

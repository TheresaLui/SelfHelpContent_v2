# Partner Center Accounts Onboarding Access Direct Bill requirements

Resources providing knowledge on CSP Direct Bill Program requirements

## **Recommended Steps**

We are introducing a performance standard as part of the direct bill partner requirements. Partners who want to enroll as direct bill partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program must meet at least USD300K in Cloud Solution Provider program revenue during the 12 months prior to [required support contract](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/partnersupport) renewal date.

This performance standard will go into effect in January 2021 for current direct bill partners, and you will need to meet the requirements by your partner support plan renewal date.

Please refer to [Subscription analytics report](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/analytics/licenseanalytics) for details of previous 12 months revenue and refer to [analytics report guide](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/new-subscription-analytics-report-on-partner-center-guide-pdf) for more information.

**Note**: The Subscription Analytics report does not currently include Azure plan revenue. To calculate the Azure Plan contribution to annual revenue, refer to the "Recurring and one-time purchases" tab in [Billing](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/billing/overview) and add your monthly invoice total (multiplied by the number of months from your support anniversary date) to the other subscriptions revenue shown in the Subscription Analytics report. This total must be greater than 300k USD to meet the revenue requirement.

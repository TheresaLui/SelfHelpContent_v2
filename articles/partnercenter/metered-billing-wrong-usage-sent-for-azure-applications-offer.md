# Partner Center Wrong usage sent for Azure Applications offer
 
## **Recommended Steps**
If you sent the incorrect usage to Microsoft and this did or will result in undercharge of the customer, Microsoft will not initiate a bill to the customer for under-reported usage or pay you for that usage. You will have to bear the loss of revenue due to under-reporting.
If one of the following cases applies, you can open a support ticket to request refund or billing adjustment for your customers:
 -You confirmed that one of the anomalies we found is a real issue and the incorrect usage would result in **overcharge** of the customer.
 -You discover that you sent incorrect usage to us and the incorrect usage would result in **overcharge** of the customer.
 -You would like to request a refund for the charge of your customer’s metered billing usage.

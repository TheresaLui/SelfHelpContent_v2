# <-- SaaS offer missing deflection -->

While publishing your offer, the information you provide during publishing will be used to [automatically determine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#understand-storefront-selection) the [eligible storefronts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#selecting-a-storefront-publishing-option-and-offer-type-for-your-solution). Selection of Properties and usage of features such as metered billing may have an impact on this determination. If you have published your offer and it is does not show in the expected marketplace, you may be using specific billing models restricted to one storefront or need to change the configuration of your offer. The following resources may help understand what actions you can take to achieve your desired result.

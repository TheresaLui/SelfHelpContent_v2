# Billing and Invoicing Reconciliation file Delayed or not available for download

## **Recommended Steps**

For usage-based and license-based billing, your invoice and recon file are available within two (2) days of your selected billing date in UTC. For example, if you have a September 12th billing date, the invoice generation process will begin at 12:00 AM UTC on the 13th, and complete by 12:00 AM UTC on the 14th.

For one-time and recurring billing, the billing period is aligned to the calendar month, and the invoice/reconciliation files will be available between the 6th and 8th of every month. For more information see Azure Plan billing.

To learn about any ongoing billing-related issues that may affect your recon file, see the [Partner Center status](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/support/csp/service-health-status?category=csp).

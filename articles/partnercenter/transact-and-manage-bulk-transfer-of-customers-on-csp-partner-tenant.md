# Transact and Manage - Bulk transfer of customers on CSP partner tenant

Support assisted move of CSP customers and associated subscriptions from one CSP direct bill tenant to another where the partner legal entity is the same (e.g. merge and acquisition or tenant function separation scenarios).

## **Recommended Steps**

For partner to partner or channel transfer scenarios refer to [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/transition-seat-based-services) for license based services or [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/switch-azure-subscriptions-to-a-different-partner) for Azure services. Support assisted move of CSP customers and associated subscriptions from one CSP direct bill tenant to another are only supported where the partner legal entity is the same (e.g. merge and acquisition or tenant function separation scenarios). You must provide evidence that customers have been notified of any change in partner company/trading name and accepted transfer of the DAP privileges.

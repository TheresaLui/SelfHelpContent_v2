# Transact and Manage - Delete, Remove or Break reseller relationship

Requirements to remove a CSP relationship from the customer list in Partner center.

## **Recommended Steps**

Removing a relationship has the following consequences:

• Removes the customer from your list of customers in Partner Center
• Removes you from the list of available support contacts for your customer
• Removes your delegation admin privileges for the customer
• Prevents you from making future purchases for the customer

To remove a relationship, you'll first need to cancel Azure RI reservations, cancel software purchases, and suspend any remaining active subscriptions.

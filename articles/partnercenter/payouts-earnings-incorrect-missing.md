# Earning incorrect or missing issues

In an event earnings are missing or earning amounts appears incorrect, you can follow the recommended steps to troubleshoot your issues related to earnings.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Why are my earnings missing?**

* The customer order may not be eligible for payout yet. For non-enterprise customer orders, Microsoft must receive customer payment before publisher earning becomes eligible. For enterprise customer orders, your earnings will be available 1-2 days after Purchase order date. Verify Order status in [Orders reports](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/analytics/order).
* Earnings from transactions before July 2019 may not be shown in the transaction history report. Check Historical Statements in [Payout Download](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentiveexport).
* Check the [time-frame of payout cycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/payment-thresholds-methods-timeframes) and understand when your earnings should appear in the payout statement

**Why are my earnings missing?**

* If the order was partially paid by your customer, your earning amount will be based on the partially paid amount after deducting fee and appropriate tax
* •	Check tax remit responsibility by country. In case of countries where tax is Microsoft-responsible, Microsoft collects and deducts the tax from publisher earnings. The transaction amount shown in the statement is after tax amount. See [Tax details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/tax-details-paid-transactions).
* •	SaaS and IaaS offers have a discounted agency fee at 10% instead of the standard 20%, leaving an earnings rate of 90%. This promotion is effective until June 30, 2021.

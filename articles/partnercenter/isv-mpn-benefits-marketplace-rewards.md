# Partner Center MPN Benefits - Marketplace Rewards

## **Recommended Steps**

1. As an MPN Partner, once you have acquired a subscription, go to [Benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/partnership/benefits) tab in your Partner Center dashboard
2. Ensure that you are a user with Global Admin, Admin Agent or an MPN Partner Admin role to perform these activities
3. Click on **Marketplace Rewards** tab in the left navigation panel:

	- Marketing and Sales benefits
	- Select **Marketing and Sales benefits** tab on Marketplace Rewards page to see your list of benefits
	* To activate any sales and marketing benefit, you must first assign a company marketing contact. This contact will receive follow-up communications about your Marketplace Rewards.
	- To add or update your marketing contact information, go to the Marketing and Sales benefits tab on Marketplace Rewards page, then select **Add, update, or change**
	- Select a user from the list. If the user you want to assign is not in the list, you can add new users in Account settings.
	- Provde an email address for the user that's different from the email address associated with your company's Partner Center account. We will email instructions for using your Marketplace Rewards benefit to your designated marketing contact's email address.
	- Provide the contact phone and preferred language for this marketing contact. After you finish entering this information, select **Assign user**.
	- After you’ve updated the marketing contact, select **Activate** for the benefit you want to start using. Once you activate a benefit, your marketing contact will be contacted by a member of the Rewards team within a week.

# Commercial Marketplace - Offer or App does not show in marketplace

Note that it can take up to 4 hours for the offer to be visible in the marketplace after the publishing step has completed.

If this step is taking longer than 4 hours, please log a support request.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If your offer has private plans or uses metered billing, your offer will not be shown in AppSource

2. If your offer has private plans, make sure that you are logged in with an Azure subscription that is included in the audience of who can see the plan

3. If your offer includes a solution template, make sure that you haven't configured it to be hidden

4. If you are trying to access an offer that is published only to the Preview step, make sure you are logged in with credential or subscription ID that is included in your Preview audience

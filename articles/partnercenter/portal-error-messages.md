# Gather log information and attach to your service request

If an error occurs while you’re on a Partner Center page, you may be prompted to gather log information. Select Collect more information from the link that drops down from the top of the page to open the Client Diagnostic tool. This tool gathers information that the Partner Support team needs to determine the cause of the error.

## **Recommended Steps**

- On Partner Center pages that include /pcv/ in the URL, you can open the tool manually to collect this information
- On the page with the issue, press Ctrl+Alt+D to open the Client Diagnostic tool
- Preview the diagnostic information and then save it to a file that you can attach in your support request
- Review the information in the file before sending it as it can contain personally identifiable information that you may want to remove
- Follow the on-screen instructions to save the file
- Attach the file when creating your support request

# Partner Center Analytics Office Store Program Analytics Acquisitions and Usages

## **Recommended Steps**

* The Acquisitions report does **not** include data about refunds, reversals, chargebacks, and so on. To estimate your solution proceeds, visit Payout summary.
* The SLA for **Acquisitions data** is currently **4 days**
* Customers can arrive at your app's listing by clicking a custom campaign not created by you. We stamp every page view within a session with the campaign ID from which the customer first landed on Microsoft AppSource. We then attribute conversions to that campaign ID for all acquisitions within 24 hours. Because of this, you might see a higher number of total conversions than the total conversions for your campaign IDs, and you might have conversions or add-on conversions that have zero page views.
 
## **Recommended Documents**

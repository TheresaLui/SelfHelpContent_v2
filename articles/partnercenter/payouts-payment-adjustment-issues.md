# Payment and adjustment issues

## **Recommended Steps**

**Why is my payment missing?**

* Ensure your Payout status and Tax profile status are shown as "valid" [here](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview)
* You may not have met the minimum threshold for a payment. Earnings must be at least $50 USD to receive a payment.

**How do I elect not to receive payment?**

You can hold payments in [Payout Profile](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview); simply check Hold. Microsoft will hold payment to you until you release the Hold.

**Why do I receive in a different currency than the purchase currency?**

The payout currency is based on the currency you selected in payout profile. The purchase currency is based on the currency the customer paid.

**How do I reconcile adjustments?**

Payment adjustments are payment corrections to accommodate compensatory adjustments such as system issues. In the payout statement, ReasonCode will specify the reason for the adjustment. These are not meant to reconcile directly to individual transactions.

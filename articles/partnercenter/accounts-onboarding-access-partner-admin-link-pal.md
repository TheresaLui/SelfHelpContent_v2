# Partner Center Accounts, Onboarding, Access Partner Admin Link (PAL)

## **Recommended Steps**

* You can [use the Azure portal to link partner id](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id#use-the-azure-portal-to-link-to-a-new-partner-id) or [use Powershell to link an Azure account to a partner ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/link-partner-id#use-powershell-to-link-to-a-new-partner-id).

* This link also allows [CSP (Cloud Solution Provider)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/csp-overview) partners to receive [partner earned credit for managed services (PEC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/partner-earned-credit) for customers who have [signed the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement) and are [under the Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-get-started). Ensure that the MPNID linked via PAL matches the MPNID associated to the CSP transaction/purchase. If the MPNID linked via PAL doesn't belong to the same Organization (V-Org/PGA) of the associated CSP transaction/purchase, PEC will be LOST.

* If you can't see a linked customer in influenced revenue reports, verify the linked user account has [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on the customer Azure subscription or resource.

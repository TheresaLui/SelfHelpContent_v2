# Not receiving lead emails for my business profile

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that your Partner Center login work email matches one of the contact emails provided in the Business profile contact information, for the specific location. E-mail notifications are sent to these contacts. To view this information, navigate to *‘Business Profile > Locations > Location > Contact Information’*. We recommend verifying this by sending a test lead to your business profile account. Please check your email application rules to ensure lead notifications are not being routed to spam folders.
2. Note that all contacts specified will receive email notifications. No role assignments are checked for the listed contacts.
3. If you would like multiple team members to receive these emails, add them to a distribution list and add it to the business profile Contacts. Please ensure your distribution lists are permitted to receive emails from external IDs.

If your business profile is not surfaced or ranked lower in certain search queries, in Microsoft Solution Provider, please refer to the sub-topics for these in the Business profile topic.

**Note**: Please share business profile name & location when filing a support ticket.

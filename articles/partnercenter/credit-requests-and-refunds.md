# Credit requests and refunds
Partners may have different reasons for asking for credit or refunds. Follow the steps below to submit a request that can efficiently evaluated.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Determine what kind of credit request and refund you are submitting - for Azure related credits refer to [reporting an Azure issue on behalf of a customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/report-problems-on-behalf-of-a-customer#microsoft-azure).
- Download the [Credit request and refund form](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3eWCb) and complete the information. Ensure to attach the form when creating your support request, as well as the written request received from the end customer requesting the credit. CSP partners (not the end customers or the Indirect Resellers) must submit a claim with the required information within one full calendar month of the incident occurring. For example, if the incident occurred on February 15, we must receive the claim and all required information by March 31 – see more details in the Credit request and refund form.
- Important: Cancellations of subscriptions within 30 days of purchase are refunded at 100% with no need to raise a Service Request. The credit will be visible in the invoice/reconciliation file issued after the subscription suspension. If you suspend a subscription in months 2-12, you will be credited on a prorated basis.

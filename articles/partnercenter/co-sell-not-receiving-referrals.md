# Not receiving referrals for my business profile


## **Recommended Steps**

- You should have referral admin access to view or create referrals
- It takes 24 hours for your business profile to appear on Microsoft solution provider webpage after publishing
- Try to search for your profile by company name which is available in the advanced filters section after searching anything
- Your profile may not be available in the first page of search results potentially due to a lower rank compared to other profiles
- Try to search with the exact keywords that you have entered in the business profile and scroll to find the profile
- Create a support ticket if your profile is getting listed on the first page and you are still not receiving referrals

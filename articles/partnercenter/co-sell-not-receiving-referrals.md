# Not receiving referrals for my business profile


## **Recommended Steps**

- You should have referral admin access to view or create referrals
- It takes 24 hours for your business profile to appear on Microsoft solution provider webpage after publishing.
- Try to search for your profile by company name which is available in the advanced filters section after searching anything.
- Your profile may not be available in the first page of search results potentially due to a lower rank compared to other profiles.
- Try to search with the exact keywords that you have entered in the business profile and scroll to find the profile.
- Create a support ticket if your profile is getting listed on the first page and you are still not recieving referrals

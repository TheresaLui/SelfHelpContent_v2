# Accounts Onboarding Access Account verification Email ownership

## **Recommended Steps**

* Email ownership verifies that the primary contact (primary email) address is valid. The primary contact email address must be a work account that is monitored and can send/receive email. **Partners shouldn't use**: (1) a personal email address not associated with the company domain. (2) a tenant user sign-in not associated to email (for example, jsmith@testcompany.onmicrosoft.com)
* If you don't receive the email ownership verification email message within one business day, you can request to resend using the links below and following the appropriate instructions:
  * For [MPN](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/connectedpartnerprofile) accounts
  * For [CSP](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/accountsettings/partnerprofile) accounts
  * For [Commercial marketplace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/management) accounts

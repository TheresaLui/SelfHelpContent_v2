# Viewing active and closed deals

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check that you have **Referral Admin access** (Refer to Recommended Documents)
2. In Partner Center select the Deal Registration tab under Referrals:

   - All Active/Non-closed deals will be in the Action Required or In Progress tabs under Deal Registration
   - Action Required means the deal has not been completely filled out and registered
   - In Progress means the deals have been registered and are now awaiting review by Microsoft. If Microsoft requires additional information, the deal will move to the Action Required tab. If the registered deal is for an ISV Connect contract, find these in Submitted state under In Progress.
   - Approved or Rejected can be found in the Closed tab
  
*Refer to Recommended Documents for more information on registering a deal for both Co-sell and closed non Co-sell contracts*.

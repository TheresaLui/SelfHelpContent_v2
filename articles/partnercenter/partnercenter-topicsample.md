# This is a sample title


This is a brief paragraph about the problem. It can be as simple as "Most users are able to resolve their [topic] issue using the steps below", or a more detailed outline of the issue being experienced.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This is the first step.
2. This is a step with no link, blade, or instructions. Note that because the next line is a continuation of the list, no <br> (br) break is needed.
3. As in the example above, this step contains multiple sentences. When a step has multiple complete sentences, the use of a period to end each sentence is acceptable.
4. This step does not have multiple sentences, so no period is required at the end

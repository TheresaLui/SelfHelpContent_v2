- At least one solution from your company should be Co-sell ready for you to start creating Co-sell opportunities
- Please check to make sure that the MPN id associated with your solution in GTM is same as the MPN id associated with your tenant. If they are not, please contact support with this information.
- All documentation, associated with all other Business Profile, Co-sell and Referral support topics has access information at the beginning so please refer to those articles as appropriate.

# Partner Center Incentives: Proof of Execution (PoE) status and submission deadlines

## **Recommended Steps**

**PoE Submission Deadlines**

You must submit the Proof of Execution (PoE) for your plan within 180 days of the campaign start date. Microsoft will review your PoE within last day of the following month of POE submission. Use the procedure below to submit the PoE for your plan. 

**PoE Status**

To view the status of a PoE:

1. Sign into the [Partner Center dashboard](http://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard)
2. On your **Incentives** page, select **Plan Management**, and then select the program you want. The status page will open. 
3. In the **Claims** section, the status of each PoE is listed in the **Status** column
4. The following are the various possible statuses for your co-op claim PoE:

	* Submitted
	* Under review (Microsoft will complete its review before the last day of the month after you submit your PoE)
	* Action required
	* Editing 
	* Approved
	* Rejected

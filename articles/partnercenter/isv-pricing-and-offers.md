# Partner Center pricing and offers

## **Recommended Steps**

You can see which promotions you're eligible for, if any, on your [Promotions](https://partner.microsoft.com/commerce/Promotions) page. From the Promotions menu you can see a list of current promotions, along with the discount, promotion type, and start and end dates for the subscription. If no promotions are available, you'll see a message indicating this.

You can also see promotions when making a purchase. When you select a subscription, the promotion pricing appears on the **Review** page.

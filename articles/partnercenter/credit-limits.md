# Credit limits

## **Recommended Steps**

* The credit limit is the amount extended to an onboarding CSP partner by Microsoft Global Financial Services. This is the maximum USD amount that a partner can use for Azure reservations, Software, Marketplace, Azure 145 P subscriptions, Office and Dynamic products on the Partner Center.
* When purchasing a new Office or Dynamic products or Microsoft Azure 145 P subscription, a credit check will be performed to determine your available balance to decide whether to approve or reject the transaction.
* You can contact our **credit service support team via email** to inquire about your credit limit and outstanding payments at **ucmwrcsp@microsoft.com**.

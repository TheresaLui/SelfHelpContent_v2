# Billing and Invoicing Invoices usage-based recurring billing

## **Recommended Steps**

You'll be billed for both license-based and usage-based (Azure 145P offer) products in the currency of the country or region in which you're located. You're billed the same regardless of the location of the customer to whom you sold the product.

For both license-based and usage-based billing, your invoice is available within two (2) days of your selected billing date, in UTC time. For example, if you have a September 12th billing date, the invoice generation process will begin at 12:00AM UTC on the 13th, and complete by 12:00AM UTC on the 15th.

To view your current billing status, invoices, and reconciliation files, use the following procedure:
1. Sign in to the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. On the left-hand menu, select Billing, and then select Recurring.
3. On the billing status page, select the invoice or reconciliation file to view more detailed information.

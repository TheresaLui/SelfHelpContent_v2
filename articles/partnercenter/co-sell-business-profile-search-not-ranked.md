# Partner Center Business profile does not appear in Microsoft Solution Provider for certain search queries

## **Recommended Steps**

* Business profile search results are derived based on filtered profiles which are then ranked
* Only 24 profiles are fetched for each customer query
* If your profile is not ranked higher even though it matches all the filter criteria, it may not surface in the search results
* To view if your business profile is properly published, click on the view link in the business profile section

**Criteria for *Best match* category**

Below data from business profiles is used to fetch a filtered list of profiles

1. Location - based on radius
2. Exact match is required with the customer org size and any one of the other field in your business profile
* Industry expertise 
* Product
* Service type  
* Solutions 
* Skills and capability

After fetching the filtered profiles, ranks are assigned to the profiles based on the below earned attributes
* Azure expert MSP   
* Advanced specialization 
* Endorsements 
* Competencies
* Past referrals conversion data

**Criteria for *Most responsive* category**
This section takes in to account, the past performance with respect to the number of referrals received, number of referrals accepted among them, time to accept, number of referrals marked as won etc.

**Criteria for *Nearest to you* category**
This is based on the address that is entered in the search. If a city name is entered in the search, the city center latitude and longitude as determined by bing maps is considered for measuring the distance from the partners location in their profile to the city center

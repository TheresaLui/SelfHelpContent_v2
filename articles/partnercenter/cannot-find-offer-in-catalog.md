# Cannot find an offer in the catalog

There may be different reasons you cannot find the offer you are looking for in the catalog.

## **Recommended Steps**

- **Verify your customer is qualified**. Many offers require special qualifications to be sold to customers. These special segments include Education, Non-profit and Government Community Cloud (GCC). Before logging an issue, first verify the customer's qualifications are set accordingly. You can check this by click the customer from the customer list and viewing the account. The account will have a Special Qualification set if applicable. If you are trying to purchase Education for a customer that is not qualified, you will not see those offers in the catalog. Consult the [special segments documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/get-special-pricing-for-offers) for more information on qualifying your customers.
- **Decide whether you are trying to purchase an Add-on or a Base-offer**. Many of the license-based services such as Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 enable both catalog purchases of the Base offers as well as Add-ons. Only base offers can be purchased in the catalog. To purchase Add-ons ensure you first purchase the Base offer in the catalog and then select the customer from the customer list and then select the subscription for the base offer. Add-ons can be applied to the base offer on this manage subscriptions page. 
- **Verify the products are available in your market**. Many products and services are configured to only be sold to customers in specific countries. You can find the list of supported countries in the various price list files. License-based services supported countries are in the Offer List Matrix on the pricing and offers page.
- **Verify the offers are available in the price list**. The available list of offers can change from month to month. If you cannot find an offer in the catalog be sure to verify it is available in the current price lists in the **Sell > Pricing and Offers** page.

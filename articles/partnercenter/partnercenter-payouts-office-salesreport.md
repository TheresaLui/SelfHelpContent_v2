# All paid Office and SharePoint add-in subscriptions will be cancelled by September 30, 2020, and the Office sales reports will no longer be available on Partner Center after October 10, 2020.  **Save all your sales data** for record keeping before then.

## **Recommended Steps**

After Oct 10, 2020, to request for historical sales data, follow the below steps:
1. Continue on this page to file a support ticket, it's important that the support ticket is filed against this specific support topic to minimize the processing time 
2. Provide the identifier for your add-in to make the request: either the GUID in the Partner Center product link or the the Office asset ID (starts with WA) included in the AppSource listing page link of your product
3. If you need to request data for multiple products, you must provide the identifier for each one 
4. Provide the date range for the data on the support ticket
5. After the ticket is filed, dedicated operations team will pull the sales data requested 

**Note:**the historical data may be in a different format than the Office sales report in Partner Center.

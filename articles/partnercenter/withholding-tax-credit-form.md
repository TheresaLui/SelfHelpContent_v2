# Make sure you are credited for withholding tax

As of January 21st, 2020 the process for withholding tax submission has changed from creating support requests to a new process. This new process starts at the billing page in partner center. Below are the steps to submit tax withholding requests in partner center and helpful documentation. To get started you will need the tax certificate in electronic form you want to be credited for and the amount you seek credit for.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Ensure you have the tax certificate you want to be credited for in electronic form. More about tax certificates can be found in the [tax withholding credit documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/withholding-tax-credit-form). Attached tax certificate files must be one of the following file formats: .PDF and Image only (.JPEG, .PNG and .GIF). In addition, files names should not contain spaces or special characters.
- Go to the Partner Center, sign in and navigate to the billing page. 
- On the billing page locate the invoice you seek to be credited for. Next to the invoice you will see a "Tax Withholding" column with a "Submit new" option.
- Click "Submit new". This will take you to a form where you will provide the total amount you seek credit for that particular invoice. You will also need to attach the tax certificate from your local tax authority.
- Once you have provided the tax withholding total and have attached the tax certificate simply submit the form. 
- This will create a tax withholding request. When you navigate back to the billing page you should see the submission ID with the current status.
- If there are issues with your request or corrections that need to be made the team will flag the request as "needs partner attention" with details about what needs to be corrected before resubmitting.

# MPN Benefits and Competencies User assignment

## **Recommended Steps**

* From the **Settings** icon at the top right of the Partner Center, select [User management](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/users).
  * Note: If you do not see the User management menu item, please select Partner settings first and then User management.
* Click Search and check with the userâ€™s name to double check if they need a new account, before you create the new user account.
* Select **Add user**.
  * Note: If you do not see the Add user button you may not have the required user roles. The user roles Global admin or User management admin (CSP only) are required to create and manage users. The Account admin role can only manage existing user roles. The MPN Partner Admin can cannot create users or assign roles. To learn more, read [Assign users roles and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/permissions-overview).
* Select the user Roles and Permissions you need to assign to the user. Partner Center access is role-based, so you can assign permissions to customize the user's view to show only the features the user needs to complete specific tasks.
* Select **Add** to create the user account. Confirm the user's details on the next page.

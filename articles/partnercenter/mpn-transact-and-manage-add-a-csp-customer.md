# Partner Center Transact and Manage - Add a CSP Customer
 
## **Recommended Steps**

Customers you transact with on other portals such as Office 365 will appear in your [customer list](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/see-your-customer-list) on the Partner Center. You will need to establish [reseller relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center) with other existing customers. If the customer is new to Microsoft Cloud Services and does not have an existing AAD tenant, you can [add them as a new customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/add-a-new-customer#to-add-a-new-customer-in-partner-center)

We have introduced Partner Center API and user interface (UI) enhancements for Partners who meet the criteria detailed in [December 2020 announcements - Changes to the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customer onboarding requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/announcements/2020-december#8). When adding a new or updating an existing customer, eligible partners will have to submit a customer's **legal identifier** (also known as the customer's **organization INN**) and **phone number** when they next update or create a subscription for that customer. These partners can also enter an optional **middle name** for the customer.

# Partner Center Transact and Manage - Add a CSP Customer
 
## **Recommended Steps**

Customers you transact with on other portals such as Office 365 will appear in your [customer list](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/see-your-customer-list) on the Partner Center. You will need to establish a [reseller relationship](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/connect-with-your-customers#invite-a-customer-to-establish-a-reseller-relationship-with-you) with a customer who has an existing customer record in Partner Center or AAD tenant. For assistance with customers accepting relationship links [click here](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/?stage=2&topicid=d2a2befe-a177-4f14-2c70-a2599dbb7163).

If the customer is new to Microsoft Cloud Services and does not have an existing AAD tenant, you can [add them as a new customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/add-a-new-customer#to-add-a-new-customer-in-partner-center).

**IMPORTANT:** only the admin agent role can add or view customers in Partner Center

The admin agent role is available in each of the CSP partner types below:
* an authorized subscription advisor -> for help [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/advisors-build-your-business)
* a CSP Direct bill or Indirect provider -> for help [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/add-a-new-customer#to-add-a-new-customer-in-partner-center). You can only add a CSP customer whose tenant is based in the same [region/market](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview) as your tenant.
* a CSP Indirect reseller -> for help [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center). Refer to [Supported CSP partner relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/csp-supported-partner-relationships#supported-partner-transactions-in-the-csp-program) for more information.

We have introduced Partner Center API and user interface (UI) enhancements for Partners who meet the criteria detailed in [December 2020 announcements - Changes to the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customer onboarding requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/announcements/2020-december#8).  When adding a new or updating an existing customer, eligible partners will have to submit a customer's legal identifier (also known as the customer's organization INN) and phone number when they next update or create a subscription for that customer. These partners can also enter an optional middle name for the customer.

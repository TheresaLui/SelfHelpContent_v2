# Partner Center Transact and Manage - Add a CSP Customer
 
## **Recommended Steps**

Customers you transact with on other portals such as Office 365 will appear in your [customer list](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/see-your-customer-list) on the Partner Center. You will need to establish [reseller relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center) with other existing customers. If the customer is new to Microsoft Cloud Services and does not have an existing AAD tenant, you can [add them as a new customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/add-a-new-customer#to-add-a-new-customer-in-partner-center)

## **Recommended Steps**

You can't create an Azure plan for an existing customer with a Microsoft Azure (MS-AZR-0145P) subscription. However, you can [transition a customer from their existing CSP Azure offers to Azure services under the Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-transition) in the new commerce experience in the CSP program from within Partner Center. To transition an existing customer, use the product upgrade APIs to follow these steps:

* [Check whether the customer is eligible for a transition to Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/get-eligibility-for-product-upgrade)
* [Initiate a product upgrade for the customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/create-product-upgrade-entity)
* [Check the status of a product upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/get-product-upgrade-status)

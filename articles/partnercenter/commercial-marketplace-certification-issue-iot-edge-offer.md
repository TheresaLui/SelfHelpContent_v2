# Commercial Marketplace - Certification issue - IoT Edge Offer
Submitted offers undergo rigorous review during the certification step, some automated and others manual. Review the commercial marketplace certification policies to learn more on tests performed during the review.

The review process can take up to 2 business days.

If your offer failed certification, the following resources can help you understand the failure and what actions should be taken to address it. Certification requires re-publishing your offer after making the necessary changes to send the offer back through the review.

## **Recommended Steps**

2. Review the [commercial marketplace certification policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies) for the applicable policy failures to resolve any issues.
3. Make adjustments to your offer in Partner Center according to the policy recommendation. This can touch any part of your offer related to the policy failure.
4. Re-publish your offer in Partner Center to resubmit your changes for certification. If needed, provide additional details in "Notes for certification" on the review and publish page during publishing.

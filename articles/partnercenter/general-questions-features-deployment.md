# Product Feature and deployment questions

**Please Note**
- CSP partner support is not the best place to ask these questions, instead utilize your MPN Benefits to ask questions using your MPN technical presales and deployment services benefits.

## **Recommended Steps**

If your MPN has been migrated to partner center you can log your question [here](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/partnership/benefits/createadvisoryhoursservicerequest)

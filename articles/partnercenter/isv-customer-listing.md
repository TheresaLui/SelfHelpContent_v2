## **Recommended Steps**
 
- There are two pre-requisites for a partner to access the customer list:

  - they need to have a role that allows them to add customers
- Learn more about configuring user roles and permissions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/permissions-overview)
- To correct the customer details (name, domain name, bill-to info etc) that appear in the customer list refer to [Updating customer details](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/sell-to-education-customers#correct-the-customer-account-information).

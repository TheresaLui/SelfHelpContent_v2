# Certification issue - SharePoint add-in

Submitted products undergo rigorous review during the certification step, some automated and others manual. Review the commercial marketplace certification policies to learn more on tests performed during the review.

The review process can take up to **5 business days**. Cancelling an in-progress submission will reset your position to the back of the review queue when you resubmit.

If your product failed certification, the following resources can help you understand the failure and what actions should be taken to address it. You must resubmit your product after making the necessary changes to send it back through the review.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Open the certification failure report shared in email or access it from the publishing status on the Product overview page in Partner Center.
2. Review the [commercial marketplace certification policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/marketplace/certification-policies) for the applicable policy failures to resolve any issues.
3. For general questions about policies, processes, or validation requirements, engage with the review team via [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=office-store). Tag your question with "Office-Store". Please be aware that the review team will not be able to discuss individual submission results on Stack Overflow.
4. Make adjustments to your product in Partner Center according to the policy recommendation. This can touch any part of your product related to the policy failure.
5. Re-publish your product in Partner Center to resubmit your changes for review. If needed, provide additional details in "Notes for certification" on the Review and publish page during publishing.

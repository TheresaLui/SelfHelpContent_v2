# Partner Center Cosell Deal Registration Cannot find, access or register deal

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you are looking to **create a co-sell opportunity for Azure or Dynamics**, please use the **+ New Deal in the Co-Sell Opportunities tab**. If you are looking to **register a closed**, non co-sell signed contract for a Dynamics solution as part of the **ISV Connect Program**, please use the **+ New Deal Registration** button in the **Deal Registration -> Action Required tab**.
2. Access: To access deal registration left navigation in Partner Center or the + New Deal Registration button, **Referral Admin access is required**. Your company **Global Admin can assign** the Referrals Admin role if required. (Refer to Recommended Documents)
3. To **find an existing deal or register a new** one, go to Referrals in the left navigation of partner center and click the **Deal Registration tab**.
4. There are 3 tabs: Action Required, In Progress, and Closed.
   - All Active/Non-closed deals will be in the Action Required or In Progress tabs under Deal Registration.
   - Action Required means the deal has not been completely filled out and registered.
   - In Progress means the deals have been registered and are now awaiting review by Microsoft. If Microsoft requires additional information, the deal will move to the Action Required tab. If the registered deal is for an ISV Connect contract, find these in Submitted state under In Progress.
   - Approved or Rejected can be found in the Closed tab.
  
*Refer to Recommended Documents for more information on registering a deal for both Co-sell and closed non Co-sell contracts*.

# Transact and Manage - Purchasing an add-on for online subscription
Details on how to purchase and the behavior of add-ons for CSP online subscriptions.

## **Recommended Steps**

- To purchase an add-on the customer must first have an active base subscription. You can't purchase add-ons through the catalog.
- Refer to the Cloud Reseller offer matrix for more information about pricing and offers. Suspending the base subscription will also suspend any associated add-ons.
- Start dates for add-ons align to the base subscription and charges are calculated from the Charge start date and Charge end date with pro-rata charges in the first invoice. For additional information, see [License-based billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/license-based-billing).

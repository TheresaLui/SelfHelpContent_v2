# Partner Center Update a Co-sell opportunity that was Closed as Won Lost Declined or Expired

## **Recommended Steps**

Re-opening or updating a declined, expired, won or lost Co-sell opportunity is not supported.

Accidentally created duplicate deals cannot be deleted. If they are not closed, you can update the deal value of such deals, so they do not impact reporting.
 
## **Recommended Documents**

* [Deal editing NOT allowed after Won or Lost](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/manage-co-sell-opportunities#frequently-asked-questions)
* [Additional information on Managing Co-sell opportunities](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/manage-co-sell-opportunities)

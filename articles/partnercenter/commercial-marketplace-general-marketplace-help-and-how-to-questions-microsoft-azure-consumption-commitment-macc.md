# Partner Center Commercial Marketplace General Marketplace Help and How-to questions Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)

This topic is to help with general questions about MACC eligible offers in Commercial Marketplace. Publishers who have achieved "Azure IP Co-sell Ready" or "Azure IP Co-sell Prioritized" status can make their offers more discoverable in Azure Marketplace by customers looking to decrement their Azure platform commitment.

## **Recommended Steps**
- MACC eligible offers are offers that are **transactable** in Azure Marketplace and/or AppSource that **have Azure IP Co-sell status**. BYOL (bring your own license) offers are NOT considered transactable.
- As a publisher, first verify which of your offer(s) are MACC eligible by working with your PDM.
- It is important to note that only Azure consumption commitments are eligible. Prepayments, Monetary Commitments, or any other credits are not eligible for marketplace purchases.
- Anything else you think would drive questions to support that we want to pull out?

# Transact and Manage Transact and Manage Updating customer qualification via API

## **Recommended Steps**

Existing PUT Qualification APIs Partner Center APIs will be retired. Refer to [February 2021 announcements](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/announcements/2021-february#1). 

At that time, you will need to have transitioned to using the new POST Partner Center APIs in order to be able to purchase Education offers and the new GET qualifications API to purchase pre-qualified Academic, Non-profit and GCC offers.

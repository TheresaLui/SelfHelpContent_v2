# Microsoft Customer Agreement

Starting February 1, 2020, direct bill and indirect providers in CSP are required to confirm customer's acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement for any CSP offers under Microsoft Public Cloud. Without confirming the customer's acceptance for the new agreement, partners will not be able to make a new purchase for the customer including changing seats and renewal of existing purchases from that date (note: auto-renewal will not be impacted).

## **Recommended Steps**

* Confirm customer's acceptance using the [Partner Center web user interface or API](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement)'
* Partners using APIs for the existing Microsoft Cloud Agreement need to revise their existing implementation with [updated API](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement).
* Train your agents and resellers on the [new agreement terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/customeragreement), and presenting the new agreement and validating customer acceptance.

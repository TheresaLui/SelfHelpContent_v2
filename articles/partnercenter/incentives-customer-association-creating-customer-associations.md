# Partner Center Incentives: Creating and submitting customer associations

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the Partner Center dashboard, under **Incentives**, select **Overview**, and then select **Customer associations**
2. At the top of the Customer associations page, select **+ Customer association**
3. Select the **MPN ID** of the partner location to be associated with the customer, and then add the customer's domain name and Directory ID. [Where are these?](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/find-customer-domain-name)
4. Select **Continue**
5. Select the **Solution area** and **Activity**

**Note**: If you select Business Applications, select either **Usage and/or Pre-sales**, or **Revenue association**, and then select **Continue**. If you select Revenue association, you'll be prompted for slightly different information than what's listed below.

6. Enter the appropriate information on the **Associate customer page**, and then select **Create claim**
7. Select the product(s) associated with this customer association, and then select **Continue**
8. Complete the customer contact information and your company's contact information. All fields are required.  

**Note**: If your product is Dynamics 365, and the product you choose has multiple subscriptions for this particular customer, you'll also need to enter the subscription ID.

9. Supply your proof of execution (POE). You can drag it to the box, browse to your own supporting documentation, or use a template by selecting **Download template**.
10. Add and save comments if you like, and then select **Submit claim**. We'll send an email to the customer requesting approval of your customer association.  

**Note**: Once you submit your customer association, you can't edit it. The status of your customer association appears in the **Status** field. Select **History** to view the history of a customer association.

# Partner Center Incentives: Managing payout and tax profiles

## **Recommended Steps**

Before you can receive payment for your incentive programs for a particular MPN location, you must complete your enrollment by associating a valid payout and tax profile with the program and MPN location. Microsoft will use this payout and tax profile to issue payments. You may be allowed to use electronic bank transfer or a credit note for payment, depending on the rules of the incentive program.

**Note:** If you need help identifying the correct tax information, contact the appropriate government sources in your country. 
For partner companies in the United States, if you require information on completing the W8 or W9 forms, the following addresses take you to the IRS site:

* [IRS W8 information](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8.pdf)
* [IRS W9 information](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw9.pdf)

**Where can I see the payout and tax profiles for my organization that I can use?**

To view your payout and tax profiles: 

1. Log into [Partner Center](http://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).
2. Select the gear icon to open the **Settings** menu.
3. Select **Partner settings** 
4. Under **Account settings**, select **Payout and tax**, and then select **Payout and tax profile**. You’ll see all existing payment and tax profiles along with status and ability to edit.


**My organization is participating in multiple incentive programs. Do I need to provide my payment and tax profile multiple times?**

With payment profiles, it’s usually up to you. Payment profiles are created at an organization level, which allows for the same bank profile to be assigned across multiple MPN ID’s and incentive programs within an organization. In most cases you can either reuse an existing profile or create a new one. There may be exceptions, however, when applying your bank profile to different countries or regions, as local bank or tax rules may apply. 

Tax profiles created for an MPN location get reused and automatically populated when the same MPN location participates in other incentive program. But there can be exceptions. For example, the payout rules of a new incentive program may require additional details for the tax profile.  


**I am only able to log in with my @onmicrosoft.com domain. What should I do?**

Contact your Account administrator to add additional domains to the AAD account.

# Partner Center Incentives: Incorrect or missing payments

## **Recommended Steps**

**Why is my payment either missing or incorrect?**

Missing or incorrect payments are often due to one of the following:

**You may not be eligible**

* Earnings will be available only if you meet Operational Eligibility Requirements i.e., enrolled in the respective program earning period. 

**You may not have met the requirements**

* Please check to see whether you have met the eligibility and eligible revenue rules for the incentive you’re looking for. **To check your eligibility:**

	1. Sign into Partner Center here: [Partner incentives](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/partner-incentives)
	2. Scroll down to the documents for your program
	3. Select the document link you want, and then review the sections **Partner eligibility and Eligible revenue rules**

**Your payment profile may be incomplete**

* Your incentive earnings start date will be the first day of the month in which you’ve completed all of the eligibility requirements, including onboarding with payout and tax details
* Earnings will not be available for the months prior to payout and tax completion

**You may have an outstanding action**

* It could be that your incentives are not being processed because there’s an outstanding action pending from you. **To view your outstanding actions**:

	1. Sign into Partner Center here: [Partner incentives](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/partner-incentives)
	2. Open the Transaction history page
	3. Review the fields in this page for any outstanding actions to be completed, such as Pending Tax profile, Pending payment profile, or Pending tax invoice submission

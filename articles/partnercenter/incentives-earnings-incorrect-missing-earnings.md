# Partner Center Incentives: Incorrect or missing earnings

## **Recommended Steps**

Missing or incorrect earnings may be caused by one of the following issues:

* You may not have met the requirements. Check to see whether you have met the [eligibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/incentives-payment-issues#my-payment-is-missing-or-incorrect) and eligible revenue rules for the incentive you’re looking for.
* There may be a discrepancy. If you meet both Partner eligibility and Eligible revenue rules and still seeing incorrect earnings, see [How to identify earnings & payment discrepancy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4534675) for steps to access all earnings and respective transactions.

If these actions don’t help and you’re still not able to find earnings or you still believe earnings are incorrect, contact support (see *Next Step section below*).

# Partner Center Incentives: Export API information

## **Recommended Steps**

The Partner Center [Payments](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentivepayments) and [Transaction History](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/transactionhistory) reports have been built to provide the following high level benefits:

 * Multi-MPN and/or publisher aggregated view (driven by userâ€™s permission settings)
 * Rich filtering experience
 * Simplified export functionality for multiple MPNs and/or publishers
 * Enhanced data transparency on the UI
 
Building on these capabilities, we are now introducing the ability for partners to use an API to get their Payout data directly. This leverages the capability of the [Export data](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentiveexport) that you might find on the Partner Center UI.

[Available APIs](https://apidocs.microsoft.com/services/partnerpayouts)

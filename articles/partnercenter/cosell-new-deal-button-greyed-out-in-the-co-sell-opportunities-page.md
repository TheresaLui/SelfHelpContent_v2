# Cosell - New Deal button greyed out in the Co-sell opportunities page

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Clear your browser cache and cookies
2.	If you published the solution in Partner Center, navigate to *‘Commercial Marketplace > Overview’*, to verify that you have at least one *Live* offer approved for co-selling in Partner Center
3.	If you published the solution in OCP GTM, verify in the [OCP GTM portal](https://msgtm.azurewebsites.net/) that you have at least one *Live* offer approved for Co-selling in Partner Center
4.	Verify that your Partner Center seller account MPN ID matches the solution MPN ID
5.	To do the above, you can view the MPN ID associated with your Partner Center seller account in *Settings > Partner Settings > Partner Profile > Program Info*
6.	If you published the solution in your seller account in Partner Center, the solution MPN ID will be set to the MPN ID associated with your seller account
7.	If you published the solution through OCP GTM, retrieve your solution MPN ID in the [OCP GTM portal](https://msgtm.azurewebsites.net/).
8.	If the Partner Center & solution MPN IDs do not match, to update the solution MPN ID:

      a. Please reach out to your assigned PDM, for managed partner accounts

      b. Please file an Ingestion support desk ticket, for unmanaged partner accounts

**Note**: Please include your MPN ID, your solution ID and the [HTTP archive file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/capture-browser-trace) when filing a support ticket.

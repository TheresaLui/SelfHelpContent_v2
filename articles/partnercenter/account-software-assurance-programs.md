# Software Assurance programs and enrollment


## **Recommended Steps**

- Before you can enroll in the SATV program, you must first complete the requirements for the Microsoft Partner Network Learning option, which replaces the Microsoft Learning competency. Learn how to get started in the [Learning option](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/learning-partners).
- Next, you can verify your company's eligibility including applicable competency and assessment requirements in Partner Center. Follow the instructions at [step 1](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4s3bB) of the SATV workflow for more details and screenshots.
- After your company meets the eligibility requirements and your program participants have passed the compliance training course, you're ready to sign the Software Assurance Training Voucher program agreement and enroll. Please be sure to review all [SATV program policies](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3koEP), then follow the instructions in [step 2](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4s3bB) of the workflow and then complete the SATV enrollment process in Partner Center.

# Establishing a relationship with a customer in another country or region
Below documents describe how to establish relationships with customers when they reside in a country or region different than the partner's.

## **Recommended Steps**
- Select Customers from your Partner Center menu and then select Request a reseller relationship
- To request administrator permissions from this customer, select Include delegated administration privileges for Azure Active Directory and Office 365. To establish the relationship without requesting administrator permissions, clear this option.
- On the next page, review the draft email message. You can open the draft message in your default email application or you can copy the message to your clipboard and paste it into an email. You can edit the text in the email, but be sure to include the link as it is personalized to link the customer directly to your account. Select Done when you've completed this step.
- Send the email to your customer

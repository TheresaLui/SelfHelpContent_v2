# Cosell - Co-sell invite was declined by Microsoft or expired

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Navigate to the declined deal in Partner Center to view Microsoft’s *‘Decline reason’* in the *‘Microsoft’* section of the deal. Please note that no decline reason will be displayed if:
	* The deal expired before Microsoft could respond to it
	* The deal value is less than 25000 USD
2.	Please note that if your request is declined, Microsoft seller details will not be displayed. If the Microsoft seller has accidentally declined the request, please recreate the opportunity, and invite Microsoft.
3.	A decline reason of *‘No corresponding Microsoft customer record could be found’* means that our sales team cannot assist you with the deal since Microsoft does not have an existing relationship with the customer.
4.	A decline reason of *‘No Microsoft seller directly manages this customer’* means that our sales team cannot assist you with the deal since the selected customer is not a managed customer for Microsoft.

**Note**: Please include your MPN ID, the co-sell opportunity ID and a screenshot of the decline reason when filing a support ticket.

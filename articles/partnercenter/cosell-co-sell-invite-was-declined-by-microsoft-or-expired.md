# Cosell - Co-sell invite was declined by Microsoft or expired

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Navigate to the declined deal in Partner Center to view Microsoft’s *‘Decline reason’* in the *‘Microsoft’* section of the deal. Please note that no decline reason will be displayed if:
	* The deal expired before Microsoft could respond to it
	* The deal value is less than 25000 USD
2.	Please note that if your request is declined, Microsoft seller details will not be displayed.
3.	A decline reason of *‘No corresponding Microsoft customer record could be found’* means that our sales team cannot assist you with the deal since Microsoft does not have an existing relationship with the customer.
4.	A decline reason of *‘No Microsoft seller directly manages this customer’* means that our sales team cannot assist you with the deal since the selected customer is not a managed customer for Microsoft.

**Note**: Please include your MPN ID, the co-sell opportunity ID and a screenshot of the decline reason when filing a support ticket.

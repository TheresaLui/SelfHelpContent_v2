# Azure Expert MSP badge or competencies not displayed


## **Recommended Steps**
* Azure Expert MSP is allotted across multiple legal organizations (VOrgs)
* Partner Center business profile only supports creating a business profile with the Azure Expert MSP tag for the primary vOrg to which the badge has been awarded
* If this request it about business profiles not showing Azure Expert MSP tag even though it appears for business profiles in a different vOrg, the scenario is not supported in partner center
* It takes 48 hours for the advanced specializations and competency badges to appear on the Microsoft Solution Provider page after your company has been awarded the specialization or competency
* If there is an issue even after 48 hours, please create a support ticket with the details of the profile and country from which you are searching

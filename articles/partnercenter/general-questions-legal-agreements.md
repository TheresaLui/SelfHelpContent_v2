# Legal agreements and compliance

As of January 31, 2020, all partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program should have accepted the Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), including Indirect Resellers, to ensure no disruption of their ability to create new customers or place new orders for existing customers in the CSP program. Indirect Providers may see an error message while trying to create an order if the MPA is not signed by their Indirect Resellers. As soon as the agreement is signed by your reseller, you will be able to proceed with creating orders.

## **Recommended Steps**

Before you proceed, we **highly recommend** you read  [MPA FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/mpa-indirect-provider-faq) to understand your MPN and CSP account structure in Partner Center and other common questions to help you with this onboarding.

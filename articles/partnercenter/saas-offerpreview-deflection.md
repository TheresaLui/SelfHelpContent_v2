# <-- SaaS offer preview deflection -->

If you have published your offer and are experiencing issues with your offer preview, the following resources may help address the problems.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify you have the correct [preview audience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer#preview) defined for enabling access to the preview offer. If making changes to this audience, republish the offer to apply the new audience.
2. Verify you are viewing an updated preview offer. If you navigate to "Publish" on your offer and the review page calls out unpublished changes, you will need to proceed to publish those changes before they are reflected in the preview.
3. Confirm enough time has passed for creation of updates to the preview offer. Generation of the preview can take up to 4 hours.
4. If configuration is correct and your preview is taking longer than 4 hours to generate, you can check back on the offer later for progress or file a support ticket and outline and useful additional information

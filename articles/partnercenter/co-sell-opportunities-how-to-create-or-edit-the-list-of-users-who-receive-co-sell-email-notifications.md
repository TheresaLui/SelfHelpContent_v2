# Co-sell Opportunities How to create or edit the list of users who receive Co-sell email notifications


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check the contacts linked to the offer included in the deal, by navigating to '*Commercial Marketplace -> Overview -> Offers > Offer > Co-sell with Microsoft > Contacts*'. By default, these solution contacts will be notified, based on customer country match.  Click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-co-sell#contacts) to view instructions to update your solution contacts for solutions created in Partner Center. To update solutions created in OCP GTM, login to the [OCP GTM portal](https://msgtm.azurewebsites.net/) to update solution contacts.
2. If the above is not set, check the users who have the '*Referrals admin*' role assigned in the account, by navigating to '*Settings > Partner Settings > User Management > Switch the default of 'All Users' to 'Referrals Admin*', to view all users with the '*Referrals admin*' role. These users will be notified when no team or solution contacts are specified.
3. Please note that if users added do not have the '*Referrals admin*' role, they will not be able to edit co-sell opportunities.
4. We recommend setting up a distribution list:
   - If you would like multiple organization members to receive Co-sell email notifications.
   - If you would like users who leave your team to stop receiving Co-sell email notifications.
   
Please ensure your distribution lists are permitted to receive emails from external IDs.

**Note**: Please include the MPN ID, referral ID & solution ID when filing a support ticket for issues with Co-sell email notifications.

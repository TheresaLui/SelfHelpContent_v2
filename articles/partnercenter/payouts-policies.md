# Payout policies

## **Recommended Steps**

**How do I find the current agency fee and the payout rate?**

* Check the commercial marketplace Publisher Agreement. The standard agency fee is 20%. SaaS CoSell eligible transaction have a discounted fee of 10%. Check for announcements of any promotional agency fees.
* In your payout statement, Earning Rate specifies the actual payout rate for a given transaction

**When can I expect a payment from Microsoft once earnings appear on my statement?**

* Once your earning is in unprocessed status, you can check maturity date for the month your earnings will be processed for payment. Once your payment is prepared, your earning status will change to "processed".  Microsoft releases payments by the 15th of maturity month.
* For orders paid by credit card, Microsoft holds payments 30 days until the earning is matured

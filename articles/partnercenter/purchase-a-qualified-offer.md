# Purchasing a qualified offer

## **Recommended Steps**

Partners can only sell special offers to customers if they meet certain criteria.

Qualified offers are mutually exclusive, so if you have a customer who has purchased an offer of one type on an existing AAD tenant (through any transaction), you will not be able to purchase with a different qualification for that tenant.

1. Non-Profit - Must have a non-profit Azure Active Directory tenant. Learn more about [nonprofit special offers](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/mpn/nonprofit-skus-in-csp-faq.pdf). Customer must sign up through the [Microsoft nonprofit program](https://nonprofit.microsoft.com/#/register) to be eligible.
2. Education - Must be a [qualified education customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/sell-to-education-customers). 
3. US Government -To sell Azure, enroll using the [Microsoft US Government Cloud Validation form](https://azuregov.microsoft.com/csp). To sell license-based subscriptions to government, the customer must be validated via [GCC customer validation](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3Hj5y).

# TS3 SC1 Detected throttling due to frequent and large number of throttled request

<br>
#### Detected the scenario that rate limiting/throttling(429) due to frequent and large number of throttled request.

<br>Throttled request costs 0.38RUs. If the customer doesn't honor the retry after from a throttled request and continues to make large number of requests (from large number of clients), then the requests will get throttled continuously. In this case, most of the provisioned RUs will be consumed by the throttled requests itself.

<br> To continue troubleshooting this issue, please select and follow **Solution 8** from start menu to suggest the customer trying the following 3 workaround.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Solution 8 - Increase retries/wait time or RU Limit or reduce required RU consumption**

* Increase retries/wait time
* Increase RU Limit 
* Reduce required RU consumption

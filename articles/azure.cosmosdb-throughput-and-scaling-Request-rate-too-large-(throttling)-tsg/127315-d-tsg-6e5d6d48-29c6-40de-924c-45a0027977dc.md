# TL DC1 Select Typical Troubleshooting Scenario or Solution

<br>
This ASC Guided Troubleshooter can be used to identify the reason for rate limiting/throttling(429) with 4 typical troubleshooting scenarios as well as provide 8 typical solutions based on various identified root cause.
<br>
<br>

#### Typical Troubleshooting Scenarios (1 - 4)
<br>There are total 4 Typical Troubleshooting Scenarios listed as below.

* Troubleshooting Scenario 1 - Detect skew of throughput or hot partition
* Troubleshooting Scenario 2 - Detect skew of data usage or index usage
* Troubleshooting Scenario 3 - Detect frequent and large number of throttled request or parallel stored procedures
* Troubleshooting Scenario 4 - Detect standard throttling or master resource throttling

<br>Before you start any troubleshooting scenario listed above, please select and follow preparation steps described in **Troubleshooting Scenario 0** to make sure you have got required information from customer and confirmed rate limiting/throttling(429) experienced on customer environment.

* Troubleshooting Scenario 0 Gather required information from customer and check if 429 was experienced or not
<br>

<br>It's recommended that you always first check if rate limiting/throttling(429) is caused by skew of throughput, hot partition, skew data usage or index usage when possible.

<br>If you suspect your customer most likely hit rate limiting/throughput(429) with any of the Typical Troubleshooting Scenario listed above. Please select the scenario and follow the workflow to start troubleshooting directly.

<br> If you are not sure which scenario you should investigate.
<br>Please select and go through all scenarios from 1 to 4 above one by one to identify the root cause and find the proper solution.
<br>
<br>


#### Typical Solutions (1 - 8)
<br>There are total 8 solutions listed as below.

* Solution 1 - Increase RU Limit or reduce required RU consumption
* Solution 2 - Optimize Partition Key choice or application logic
* Solution 3 - Tuning Index policy
* Solution 4 - Reduce parallel of stored procedure
* Solution 5 - Increase Mater RUs Limit or reduce RUs consumption from client app side
* Solution 6 - Write-heavy scenario solution - Optimizing writes
* Solution 7 - Read-heavy scenario solution - Optimize Queries
* Solution 8 - Increase retries/wait time or RU Limit or reduce required RU consumption

<br> Please select the solution based on the investigation result of Typical Troubleshooting Scenarios 1-4.

<br> You may also reference any solution if you have already determined the root cause and need the workflow of the specific solution.

# DS5DC3 Check if api to create db col or UpdateOffer

#### Suggest to review code to check all places in code where client.CreateDocumentCollectionQuery or client.CreateDatabaseQuery is being called, and review why the application is doing that. 
<pre>
Regardless of the RU provisioned on the collections, we have a fixed RU of 250 (per account) for master resources operation - so, we can get easily throttled on master resources unless we follow the recommended coding pattern.
Recommendation is to query master resources like database or collection once (typically at the start of the application) and then cache it in the application, as shown in the sample, with a Uri Pattern.

If CreateCollection/CreateDatabase/UpdateOffer calls are getting throttled, then we can explain that there is a certain number of these calls that the customer can do in 1 minute.

The limit is 100 CreateCollection/CreateDatabase and 5 UpdateOffer calls per minute.

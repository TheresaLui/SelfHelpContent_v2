# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **Login failed, the specified AAD user could not be found**

<!--issueDescription-->
We ran diagnostics between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> UTC and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> UTC and we were able to detect login failures.
<br>
The error returned indicates that the Azure Active Directory (AAD) user was not found.  

SQL Managed Instance supports Azure AD server principals (logins), using contained database users is not required. Azure AD server principals (logins) enable you to create logins from Azure AD users, groups, or applications.  

This error may occur if you are trying to connect with an AAD user (other than the server administrator that owns the database) but there is no Azure AD-based login created for that AAD user/group/application.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check that the user exists:

    1. Connect to the database
    2. Run the following query: `select * from sys.database_principals where name = 'insert the username here'`
    3. If the query returns no record, please [create the login](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-login-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-mi-current#azure-sql-managed-instance) in the database
    4. If the user exists, please verify if the last 4 digits in the sid are the same as the last 4 digits of the Object ID for that AAD user


## **Recommended Documents**

* [Create contained users mapped to Azure AD identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure?tabs=azure-powershell#create-contained-users-mapped-to-azure-ad-identities)

* [CREATE LOGIN](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-login-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-mi-current#azure-sql-managed-instance)

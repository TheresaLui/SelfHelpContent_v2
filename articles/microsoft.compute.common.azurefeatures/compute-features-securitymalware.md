**Linux support scope** [Click for more info](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/cloud-services/support-linux-open-source-technology)
Microsoft offers Linux support for endorsed Linux distributions in Azure. The Linux vendor may need to be engaged, depending on the scenario.<br>

* Microsoft will assist you with commercially viable support in the form of break-fix issues for Linux. The Linux vendor may have to be engaged by the customer to troubleshoot specific system-related problems. Microsoft may be able to collaborate with the vendor for those issues.<br>
Have your Linux administrator engaged when working with Azure support. Any consulting work may be referred to Microsoft Services, if that type of guidance is needed.
* Scenarios that are related to security are not supported. This includes, but is not limited to, compromised virtual machines, security forensics, DDoS, or intrusion-prevention assistance.

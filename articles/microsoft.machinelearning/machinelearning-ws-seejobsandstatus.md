# How do I see a list of running jobs against my web service and their status?

## **Recommended steps**
To get the list of running Batch web service jobs:

1. Log in to the [Web Service Management Portal](https://services.azureml.net/)
2. Navigate to the specific web service
3. Click on the "Batch Request Log" tab.

If you have submitted Batch web service jobs, you should see the list of jobs here for both classic and new web services.
Note that you need admin/contributor access to the subscription that the web services are running on.

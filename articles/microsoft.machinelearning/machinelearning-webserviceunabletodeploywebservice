# Why am I unable to deploy my web service?

## **Recommended steps**
If you are unable to deploy your web service and are seeing this error during deployment, it means that this account does not have sufficient access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.
In order to deploy a Web Service to Azure, the same account must be invited to the Workspace and be given access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.

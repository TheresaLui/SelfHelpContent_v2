# File not showing up

Most users are able to resolve their Notebooks issue using the documentation below
If your file is not showing up in the File Explorer, your might have saved the file outside of the Users directory. Most users are able to resolve their File Explorer issue by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Make sure your files and folders anywhere under the **~/cloudfiles/code/Users** folder so they will be visible in all your Jupyter environments.
2. If your workspace is in a **sovereign cloud**, such as Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet, notebooks do not support using storage that is in a virtual network. Instead, you can use Jupyter Notebooks from a compute instance.

# My experiment won't run or runs slowly

Most users are able to resolve this issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check if your compute target is warm. It may take several minutes to start from a cold compute. In Azure Machine Learning studio, click **Compute** > **Training clusters** > **[compute target name]** to check the compute status and details. On the **Details** page, you can also change  **Idle seconds before scale down** to a longer period by clicking **Edit** (the default is 120 seconds).
2. If you are running on a warm compute target, make sure the compute target has enough memory to handle the data size in your pipeline
3. If you have custom conda dependency and image, this will result in a long environment preparation cost. You can check the `azureml-logs` of each module to see the time cost for image building and image download.
4. If your scheduled pipeline runs hang, file an issue by clicking the smile icon on the upper right corner of Azure Machine Learning studio. Our engineering team will investigate.
5. You might also benefit from running the Azure Machine Learning pipeline if thereâ€™s no change of the outputs in your previous modules. The system will auto-detect it and will not rerun the whole pipeline again (which should be much faster than your first-time run).
6. You can submit feedback by clicking the smile icon face on upper right corner of the Azure Machine Learning studio, with **including screenshot** selected. Be sure to select **Microsoft can email you about your feedback** in case we need to follow up with you about with your specific case.

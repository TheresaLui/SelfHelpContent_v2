# Kernel Disconnect Error in Integrated Notebooks

- Integrated notebooks aren't working in workspace 2.0 (but they work from the vm/ci itself in Jupyter)
- This affects primarily the UI and Notebooks
- How to mitigate this problem and the eventual resolution

## **Recommended Steps**

- Workaround 1: Use Jupyter from the Compute Instance/Notebook VM instead
- Workaround 2: Try restarting the Compute Instance/Notebook VM and then rerunning the notebook

# Recover my deleted or corrupted files

If your file was deleted or corrupted you might be able to find it in the checkpoints folder on your compute instance. Most users are able to resolve their corrupted file issue using the documentation below

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Open the Terminal 
2. Go into the folder that contains the corrupted file. 
3. The checkpoint file is located within a hidden folder named .ipynb_checkpoints, located within the same folder as the initial ipynb file.
4. Copy this file into a folder outside the .ipynb_checkpoints to view it.

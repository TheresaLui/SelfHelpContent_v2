# Unable to publish to pipeline

Most users are able to resolve this issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Click on the **Publish** button at the top right of the canvas.
2. Since published pipeline or pipeline endpoint is usually for retraining or batch inference scenarios, it's better to set pipeline parameters before publishing the pipeline.
3. If there's any error when publishing the pipeline, ssend us feedback by clicking the smile icon in the top right corner with **including screenshot** selected. Our engineer team will investigate.

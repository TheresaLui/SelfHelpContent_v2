Most users can resolve publishing issues to pipeline using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Select **Publish** at the top right of the canvas
2. Published pipeline or pipeline endpoint is usually for retraining or batch inference scenarios. Therefore, set pipeline parameters before publishing the pipeline.
3. If you receive an error when publishing the pipeline, send us feedback by selecting the smile icon in the top-right corner, and **Include a screenshot**. Our engineer team will investigate.

# Unable to publish to pipeline

Most users are able to resolve this issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Click on the **Publish** button on the top right of the canvas.
2. Since published pipeline or pipeline endpoint is usually for retraining or batch inference scenarios, it's better to set pipeline parameter(s) before publishing the pipeline.
3. If there's any error when publishing the pipeline, please send us feedback by clicking the smiling face on top right corner with **including screenshot** checked on. Our engineer team will investigate.

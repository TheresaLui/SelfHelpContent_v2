# Why am I unable to deploy my web service?

## **Recommended steps**
If you are unable to deploy your web service and are seeing this error during deployment, it's likely that this account does not have sufficient access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.<br>
1. In order to deploy a Web Service to Azure, the same account must be invited to the Workspace and be given access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.
2. Your account also needs to have contributor or admin access to the subscription you are deploying the web service to. If your account does not have access, it needs to be added to the subscription.

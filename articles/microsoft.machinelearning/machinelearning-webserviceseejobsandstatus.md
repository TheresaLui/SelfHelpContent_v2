# How do I see a list of running jobs against my web service and their status?

## **Recommended steps**
To get the list of running Batch web service jobs, log in to the web service management portal: https://services.azureml.net/.
After logging in, you should be able to see a list of the Batch jobs that you have previously submitted.

Note that you need admin/contributor access to the subscription that the web services are running on.

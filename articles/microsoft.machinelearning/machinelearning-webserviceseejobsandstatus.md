# How do I see a list of running jobs against my web service and their status?

## **Recommended steps**
1. To get the list of running Batch web service jobs, log in to the [Web Service Management Portal](https://services.azureml.net/).
2. After logging in, navigate to the specific web service and see the Batch jobs run history. You can see this for classic and new web services. 
3. If you have submitted Batch web service jobs, you should see the list of jobs here.

Note that you need admin/contributor access to the subscription that the web services are running on.

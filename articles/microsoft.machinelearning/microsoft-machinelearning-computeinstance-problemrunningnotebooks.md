# Problem running notebooks on compute instance

Most users can resolve issues with running notebooks on compute instance by using the following steps.<br>

**Note:** Only the creator of the compute instance can run notebooks on the compute instance. However, the **create on behalf of** feature in preview allows administrators to create and assign a compute instance to another user to run notebooks.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

- Review the [list of tools and packages installed on compute instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance#contents)

- If the compute instance is created behind VNet, make sure that you have an NSG rule that allows compute instance inbound TCP traffic on port 44224 from a Service Tag of AzureMachineLearning. If you are behind a proxy, make sure that web socket communication is not disabled for azureml.net and azureml.ms domains. If workspace storage account is attached to a virtual network please ensure compute instance is also deployed to same virtual network/subnet. If you are using custom DNS please check you settings. See [documentation for virtual network setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-secure-training-vnet#compute-instance).

- If you created a compute instance in a private link workspace, ensure that you're accessing the compute instance from within the virtual network. <br>
     * If you're using a custom DNS or host file, ensure that you have an entry for `<instance-name>.<region>.instances.azureml.ms` with a private IP address of the workspace private endpoint. In the case of a custom DNS, you may need to setup a DNS forwarder.<br>
     * If workspace storage uses a private link, you must set up a private endpoint to Azure file share. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-custom-dns?tabs=azure-portal).
     
- Configure firewalls and user-defined routes according to [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall)
- Restarting the compute instance and then re-run the notebook
- If the notebook is running slowly, check the CPU/GPU usage on the compute instance
- If you are trying to download files on the compute instance, use a single TCP session to download all the files
- For package management within a notebook, use `%pip` or `%conda` magic functions to automatically install packages into the currently-running kernel, rather than `!pip` or `!conda`
- If you are trying to pip install `pytesseract`, you need to perform "sudo apt install tesseract-ocr"
- Do not delete the `azureml_py36` conda environment or Python 3.6 - AzureML kernel. These are required for Jupyter/JupyterLab functionality.
- If you need to download temporary data to a compute instance, use the temporary disk **(/mnt)**
- Auto-shutdown on a compute instance is not currently supported
- To create a compute instance, the following RBAC permissions are required: **Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/write** **Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/checkComputeNameAvailability/action**

# Can’t delete my files

If you can't delete a file/folder, your compute instance may have a lock on that file/folder or your file/folder is marked as read-only. Most users are able to resolve their deleting file/folder issues by using the following steps to change the permissions of the file/folder.

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Click the Terminal icon in the Notebook Toolbar
2. Go to the parent folder in the terminal with "cd ~/cloudfiles/code/Users/<user_name>"
3. Use "chmod -R 755 <folder_name>" command to change the permission on the folder or file
4. Try to delete the file/folder again.

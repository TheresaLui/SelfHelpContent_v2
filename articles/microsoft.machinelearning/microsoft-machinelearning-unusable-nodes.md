# When clusters or instances have unusable nodes

This helps users diagnose unusable nodes in a training cluster or when the compute instance goes into an unusable state at the time of creation. This article does not help if your compute instance goes into unusalbe state after stopping and starting the instance again. Please create a technical support ticket in that case.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Try waiting for the compute to recycle the unusable nodes. It generally takes about an hours for that to happen, and improvements are being made to reduce this time further.
2. If there are no other jobs running on that compute or you created this instance for the first time, try to delete and recreate the compute using the same or another name.
3. Check to see if there is an error on the compute that tells you the reason on why it is in an unusable state. Some common issues here include:
* Disk being full on the node from a previous job resulting in the node being unable to run another job
* Incorrect network setup that prevents Azure to communicate with the node after being provisioned
* Azure not having sufficient capacity for that VMSize in that region, especially if you are using GPUs
4. If the problem persists, please create a support ticket

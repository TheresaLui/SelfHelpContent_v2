# Kernel Disconnect Error in Integrated Notebooks

## Background
- Integrated notebooks aren't working in workspace 2.0 (but they work from the vm/ci itself in Jupyter)
- This affects primarily the UI and Notebooks
- How to mitigate this problem and the eventual resolution

## Mitigation & Resolution
- Workaround 1: Use Jupyter from the NBVM/CI instead
- Workaround 2: Try restarting the NBVM/CI and then rerunning the notebook

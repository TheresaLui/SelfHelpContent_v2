# Can’t access Notebook shared with me by URL

To view shared Notebooks you have to have access to the workspace. Most users are able to resolve their Notebook access issue by asking the user that sent the link to follow the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Make sure the user you sent the link to has access to your workspace
1. In the Azure Portal, search "Machine Learning" 
2. Click the "Machine Learning" service 
3. Find your workspace, and click your workspace name to open the Machine Learning Workspace blabe.
4. Go to "Access Control (IAM)"
3. Check if the user you send the link to have access to your workspace.
4. If the user doesn't have access, Click the "+ Add" button
5. Add the user the appropriate level of access. 

Note: Reader access is the minimum level of access to view a shared Notebook

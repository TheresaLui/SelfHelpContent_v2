# Linux Agent/HeartBeat-related issues

## **Recommended steps**
If you are not seeing any heartbeat data in Log Analytics, try the following:

* Ensure that you are running the [latest version of the agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux#agent-and-vm-extension-version). You can see if you have the latest version by running `sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --version-check` on the machine. If you are not running the latest version, you can run `sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --upgrade` to upgrade.
* Ensure that you have [properly configured your proxy settings](https://github.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md#im-unable-to-connect-through-my-proxy-to-oms).
* Restart the OMI server daemon on the machine by running `sudo /opt/omi/bin/service_control restart`
* Restart the machine.
* Ensure that the agent successfully onboarded to the OMS Service by verifying that this file exists: `/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/conf/omsadmin.conf`. The file will only exist if the agent successfully onboarded. If the file does not exist, review the [common onboarding error codes](https://github.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md#onboarding-error-codes) and attempt to re-onboard the agent:<br>
```
cd /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin
sudo ./omsadmin.sh -w <WorkspaceID> -s <WorkspaceKey>
```

# Configure User Privileges in Workspace

* Log Analytics Workspaces are standard Azure entities that are managed by Azure RBAC. Read about [role-based access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) for overview, tools and full reference.
* In the past, user access was managed on OMS Portal, which is now deprecated. See [more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/oms-portal-transition) about the deprecation process.<br>

# Linux Agent/OMI process issues: Running high CPU

## **Recommended steps**
If you notice that the OMI process is consuming a high amount of CPU resources, try the following:

* Ensure that you are running the [latest version of the agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux#agent-and-vm-extension-version). You can see if you have the latest version by running `sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --version-check` on the machine. If you are not running the latest version, you can run `sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --upgrade` to upgrade.
* Restart the OMI server daemon on the machine by running `sudo /opt/omi/bin/service_control restart`
* Restart the OMS agent on the machine by running `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart`
* Restart the machine.

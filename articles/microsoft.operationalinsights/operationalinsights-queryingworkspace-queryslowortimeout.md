# My query is slow or timing out

## **Recommended Steps** 

### **Examine the query performance profile**

### **Consider applying query optimization steps**

The following article review all the possible explains all the common query performance optimization techniques: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/query-optimization

Most common query optimization tips:

* Don’t use “contains”, use “has” instead – “has” is much more efficient than “contains” on large data sets.

* Consider running the query on shorter time range - The time range of the query has the most substantial influence on the query performance. When less time is scanned, less data is processed.

* Consider using the time range selector in the portal and not specifying it in the query – In some cases, it would cause the system to scan less data.

* Add simple string and scalar filters early in the query – Exclude irrelevant records early in the query processing.

* Avoid JSON and XML parsing when not critical – You can treat them as strings to do early filtering.

# Move workspace to different subscription or resource group
You can move a Log Analytics workspace to a different resource group or subscription in the same region. When applicable, this also moves the associated Automation account (if exists) from one Azure subscription to another.<br>

[Workspace move considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/move-workspace#workspace-move-considerations):
* Review [Move a Log Analytics workspace to different subscription or resource group article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/move-workspace)
* Subscriptions (source and destination) have to be within the same Azure Active Directory tenant and region
* Managed solutions that are installed in the workspace will be moved with the Log Analytics workspace
* Connected agents will remain connected and keep sending data to the workspace after the move
* Linked resources must be [removed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/move-workspace#delete-in-azure-portal) from the workspace along with solutions relying on automation account:<br>
  * Update Management
  * Change Tracking
  * Start/Stop VMs during off-hours<br>

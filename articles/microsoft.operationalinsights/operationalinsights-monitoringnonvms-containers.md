# Container Monitoring Overview
There are two container monitoring tools out there: Azure Monitor for containers (Container Insights) and Container Monitoring Solution. For those who have Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Kubernetes Service Engine(Linux only), they should be using Azure Monitor for containers. For everything else, please use Container Monitoring Solution. 

Container Monitoring does not include Update Management, Security Management, AKS Azure Monitor metrics, and Linux Agent. Please go to the appropriate selection for those.

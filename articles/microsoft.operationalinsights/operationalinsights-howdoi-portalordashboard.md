# Portal or dashboard not loading or throwing error

## **Pinning A Log Analytics Visualzition to an Azure Dashboard**

Log Analytics visualizations pinned to a dashboard have some specific considerations designed for an optimal dashboard experience, Please refer to the following items before submitting your support ticket:
1.	### **I want to report a time scope larger than 30 days:**
	As dashboards may contain multiple visualizations from multiple queries, the time scope for a single pinned query is limited to 30 days.
	This means that a single query may only run on a time span smaller or equal to 30 days.
	This is done so we can ensure a reasonable load time for a dashboard. 
2.	### **My query returns a large number of data values:**
	Dashboards are a visually dense  and complex artifacts.
	In order for us to reduce cognitive load when viewing a dashboard we optimize the visualizations, loading up to 25 different data values.
	In the rare case where a visualization has more than 25 different data values – Log Analytics will optimize it, showing the 25 values with most data as discrete data values and grouping the remaining values under an “other” value.
3. ###	**I want my dashboard to auto refresh:**
Dashboards are refreshed upon load; this  means all queries related to a pinned Log Analytics visualizations in the dashboard are executed and the dashboard is refreshed once it loads.
4. ### **Azure dashboard’s time picker restricts the time span for the parts in the dashboard:**
	 If you want to decouple the time span for particular Analytics parts on the dashboard, follow these steps:
	1. Click the filter icon, located on the top left corner of Analytics parts
	2. Select *Override the dashboard time settings at the tile level*
	3. Set the desired *Timespan*
5. ### **Additioanl resources:**
	Log Analytics offers a variety of additional ways to integrate and create dashboards:
	1.	[Create a Power BI dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/powerbi)
	2.	[Create a Grafana dashboard](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-monitor-logs-in-grafana-now-in-public-preview/)
6. ### **Common error messages:**
	* **oops… looks like we couldn’t get the data**: Workspace summary page may generate this error when reaching a query concurrency limit – it can happen normally when there are multiple tiles on the page. The limit is placed to isolate and protect customers in multitenancy platform.
	* **No data**: Indicates that no record matched the query criteria
	* **Error retrieving data**: The visualization part failed to receive results from the query engine. Verify the service status by clicking *Resource health* on Azure left navigation menu and [Azure Monitor Status](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Monitor-Status/bg-p/AzureMonitorStatusBlog).

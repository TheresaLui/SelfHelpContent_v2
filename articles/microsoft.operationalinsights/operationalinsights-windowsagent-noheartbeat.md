# Windows Agent: Not reporting data or Heartbeat data missing

## **Recommended Steps**

Verify that you are running a [supported version of the Windows OS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent#supported-windows-operating-systems). 

### The agent has ***never*** sent any data, or has stopped sending ***all*** data

* [Verify agent connectivity to Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows#verify-agent-connectivity-to-log-analytics):

	* From the computer in **Control Panel**, find the item **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**. Select it and on the **Azure Log Analytics** tab, the agent should display a message stating: "The Microsoft Monitoring Agent has successfully connected to the Microsoft Operations Management Suite Service." 

* If the agent has not successfully connected to Log Analytics, ensure that you have [properly configured your proxy settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-manage#windows-agent-1):

	1. Sign on the computer with an account that has administrative rights
	2. Open **Control Panel**
	3. Select **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** and then click the **Proxy Settings** tab
	4. Click **Use a proxy server** and provide the URL and port number of the proxy server or gateway. If your proxy server or Log Analytics gateway requires authentication, type the username and [assword to authenticate and then click **OK**. 
	
* Restart the Log Analytics Agent by running the following commands in an Administrative Command prompt: `net stop healthservice` followed by `net start healthservice`. Once the process restarts, wait approximately 5 minutes to see if the problem persists. 

### The agent is reporting ***some*** data, but not all

* [Clear the agent cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/scom/manage-clear-healthservice-cache?view=sc-om-2019#to-clear-the-cache):

	1. In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Operations Manager** and then expand **Agent Details**
	2. Click **Agent Health State**
	3. In **Agent State**, select an agent
	4. In the **Tasks** pane, click **Flush Health Service State and Cache**
	5. Wait a few minutes, and try querying again for your desired data

* Force a fresh configuration: 

	1. Start an Administrative Command Prompt and run 'Net Stop HealthService'
	2. Start File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files(x86)`
	3. Go to this location: `Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent`
	4. Rename the folder **Health Service State** to **Old Health Service State**
	5. In the Administrative Command Prompt, run `Net Start Health Service`

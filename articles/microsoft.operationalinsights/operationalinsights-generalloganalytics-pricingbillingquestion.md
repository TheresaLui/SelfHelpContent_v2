# Pricing or Billing Questions

**Should move to the latest pricing model?**<br>

Log Analytics customers prior to April 2018 have an option to either stay in the pricing tier they were in at that point, or move to the [new pricing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-usage-and-estimated-costs?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json#new-pricing-model). We’ve built a Usage and estimated costs experience in Azure Monitor to help you [assess whether it is likely to be advantageous to move to the new pricing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-usage-and-estimated-costs?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json#assessing-the-impact-of-the-new-pricing-model). If you decide to move to the new pricing model, [here’s how to do so](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-usage-and-estimated-costs?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json#moving-to-the-new-pricing-model). 

**How can I understand the usage and estimated cost of my Log Analytics workspace?**<br>

The Log Analytics page “Usage and estimated costs” has information on your estimated monthly costs based on the last 30 days of usage. Additionally, there is a chart of data volume ingested so you can see any trends and information on which solutions account for the most data volume. From your workspace, click “Usage and estimated costs” on the left navigation pane to see information on your [estimated monthly costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-usage) based on the last 30 days of usage. Additionally, there is a chart of data volume ingested so you can see any trends and information on which solutions account for the most data volume.

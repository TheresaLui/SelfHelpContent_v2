# Service Map and Dependency agent Overview

This article covers **Azure Monitor Service Map** (Service Map) and the **Dependency agent**. The Service Map solution requires that the dependency agent be installed on the VMs that intend to monitor within Service Map.  For reference, components of Service Map are now available as part of Azure Monitor for VMs.

For Questions related to the Log Analytics agent (Windows and Linux) and Azure Migrate's use of Service Map, please refer to their respective support articles.

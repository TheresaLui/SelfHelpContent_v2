# Advisory or general guidance

## **Recommended Steps**

* Find answers to many common questions in [Log Analytics FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/log-faq).
* View solutions for common problems in Azure portal. In your workspace select *'Diagnose and solve problems'* on the left navigation pane.
* If you didn't find an answer for your inquiry, go to the [discussion forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/home?forum=opinsights) to search or post your question.
* Review recent updates and subscribe to notifications to stay informed. We regularly announce product updates in [Azure updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=monitor).
* Understand [data security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-security) constructs such as segregation, retention and compliance. This article explains how data is collected, processed, and secured by Log Analytics.
* Region support and ETA for new regions can be viewed in [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/) when selecting Azure Monitor.
* Understand [Kusto Query Language course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kusto-query-language-kql-from-scratch) (KQL) used to query Azure's services. It can give you basic syntax of KQL and cover advanced topics as well.<br>

# Monitoring VMs: Performance Counters

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve common issues related to Performance Counters, try the following:

1. Ensure that the agent shows a health connection to the workspace. Run the below query in your workspace to see if the machine in question shows a recent heartbeat. If no heartbeat is found, please file a ticket under "Windows Agent" for "heartbeat data missing" and follow the recommended steps.

```
	Heartbeat
	| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
```
2. Validate that you have [enabled the performance counter on your Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-performance-counters#configuring-performance-counters).
	* In the Azure Portal, select your **Log Analytics workspaces** > your workspace > **Advanced Settings**. Select **Data**, and click **Windows** or **Linux Performance Counters**. Confirm that your log is listed. 
3. Restart the agent. Once the process restarts, wait approximately 5 minutes to see if the problem persists. 
	* If you are running a Linux machine: Restart the Log Analytics Agent by running `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart`
	* If you are running a windows machine: Restart the Log Analytics Agent by running the following commands in an Administrative Command prompt: `net stop healthservice` followed by `net start healthservice`.
4. Force a fresh configuration
	* For Linux machines, run `sudo -u omsagent python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/PerformRequiredConfigurationChecks.py`
	* For Windows machines, follow the below steps:
		1. Start an Administrative Command Prompt and run `Net Stop HealthService`
		2. Start File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files(x86)`
		3. Go to this location: `Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent`
		4. Rename the folder **Health Service State** to **Old Health Service State**
		5. In the Administrative Command Prompt, run `Net Start Health Service`
4. Wait a few minutes, and [query your workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-performance-counters#log-queries-with-performance-records) to check if Event data is now being Collected.

# Problems While Creating Workspace
Review common problems and solutions related to workspace creation:

* **Error message: *Pricing tier doesn't match the subscription's billing model*.**<br>

This error can occur in these cases:<br>

   * Create a workspace with *'pergb2018'* pricing plan (introduced in April 2018), while the subscription is not in *'pergb2018'* pricing plan.
   * Create a *'Free'* workspace in subscription in *'pergb2018'* pricing plan.<br>

  Workspaces in subscriptions that were created, or [changed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-usage-and-estimated-costs#moving-to-the-new-pricing-model) to *'pergb2018'* can only be in the *'pergb2018'* pricing plan. When creating a workspace with *'PerNode'* or *'Standalone'* pricing plan in *'pergb2018'* pricing plan subscription, the workspace pricing plan is set to *'pergb2018'* instead.

* **[Canâ€™t create workspaces in West Central US region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-faq#q-why-i-cant-create-workspaces-in-west-central-us-region)<br>**

This region is at temporary capacity limit. The limit is planned to be addressed in the first half of 2019.

* **Insufficient Permissions<br>**

You must have *'Log Analytics Contributor'* permissions for workspace creation.<br>

# Delete workspace

## **Recommended Steps** 

### **Delete Log Analytics workspace**

There are two different ways to delete a Log Analytics workspace:

* [Soft-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace#soft-delete-behavior): This default delete method allows the recovery of the workspace including its data and connected agents within 14 days. After the soft-delete period, the workspace and its data are permanently purged and are not recoverable, the workspace name is released, and you can use it to create a new workspace.
* [Permanent-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace#permanent-workspace-delete): This method purges the workspace and its data, and releases the workspace name immediately. This lets you create a new workspace using the same name. For simplicity, you can also execute it in [Azure REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspaces/delete#code-try-0) site when adding this parameter: `force` with this value: `true`.<br>

**Important:** Keep the following in mind:

* You must have **Log Analytics Contributor** permissions to delete a Log Analytics workspace
* You can delete a workspace using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.operationalinsights/remove-azurermoperationalinsightsworkspace?view=azurermps-6.13.0#examples), [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspaces/delete), or in the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace#azure-portal)
* When you delete a workspace, installed solutions and linked services, such as an Azure Automation account, are permanently removed and canâ€™t be recovered<br>

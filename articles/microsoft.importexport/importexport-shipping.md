# Azure Import/Export Shipping

## **Recommended Steps**

* The carrier account that you provide must be valid, have balance, and return shipping capabilities
* Every job should have a separate tracking number. Multiple jobs with the same tracking number are not supported.
* [FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-import-export-service-faq?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#shipping-disks)
* If you want to use a carrier other than those available in the drop down list, contact Azure Data Box Operations team at adbops@microsoft.com to check if the DC supports receiving/shipping back from your carrier

  "longDescription": "We analyzed you Azure Data Explorer usage pattern over last 30 days and recommend reserved capacity purchase that maximizes your savings. With reserved capacity you can pre-purchase Data Explorer hourly usage and get savings over your on-demand costs. Reserved capacity is a billing benefit and will automatically apply to new or existing deployments. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions using 3-year reservation pricing and last 30 day's usage pattern. Shared scope recommendations are available in reservation purchase experience and can increase savings further.",

  "longDescription": "We analyzed you MySQL Database usage pattern over last 30 days and recommend reserved capacity purchase that maximizes your savings. With reserved capacity you can pre-purchase MySQL hourly usage and save over your compute costs. Reserved capacity is a billing benefit and will automatically apply to new or existing deployments. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions using 3-year reservation pricing and the usage pattern over last 30 days. Shared scope recommendations are available in reservation purchase experience and can increase savings further.",

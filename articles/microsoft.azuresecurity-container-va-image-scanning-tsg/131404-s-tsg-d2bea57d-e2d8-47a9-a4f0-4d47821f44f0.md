# Firewall error 

<!--issueDescription-->

After investigation, we are noticing from the back-end that there's an error in the scan because there is a firewall on the registry host, thus we can't pull the image to scan. Please refer to our Availability section on our documentation to view unsupported registries and images.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

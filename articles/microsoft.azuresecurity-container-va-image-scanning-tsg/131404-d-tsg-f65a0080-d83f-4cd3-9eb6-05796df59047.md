# Check for filtered out findings

Some of the scan findings are filtered out, and there is a chance that all scan findings were filtered out, thus the customer will not get any result.

Run the following query:

```
ContainerVA_ImageScanFindings 
| where RequestId  == "{ReqID}"
| summarize count()
```

Check if all findings were filtered out:

```
ContainerVA_ImageScanFindings 
| where RequestId  == "ReqID"
| where IsPublished == 0
| summarize count()
```

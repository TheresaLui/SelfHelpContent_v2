# Failed to pull image

<!--issueDescription-->

After investigation, we are noticing from the back-end that there's an error in the scan because we're failing to pull the image for scan. Please make sure the image (or repository/registry) was not deleted and exists in ACR.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

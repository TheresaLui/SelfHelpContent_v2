# Unsupported OS error

<!--issueDescription-->

After investigation, we are noticing from the back-end that there's an error in the scan because the image used is an Windows OS based image and we do not support that. Please refer to our Availability section on our documentation to view unsupported registries and images.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

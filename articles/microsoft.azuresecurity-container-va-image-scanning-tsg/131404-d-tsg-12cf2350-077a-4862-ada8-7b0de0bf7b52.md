# Check if scan requested for an image digest

**Note: **

All Kusto queries in this TSG are to be run in either of the following clusters depending on the location of the customer's registries:

cluster('rome.kusto.windows.net').database('ProdRawEvents')

cluster('romeeu.kusto.windows.net').database('ProdRawEvents')



First step to troubleshoot Container Registries is to check if the image was pushed to ACR registry and Scan was requested:

```
ContainerVA_ImageScanLifeCycleEvents 
| where SubscriptionId == "{SubID}"
//| where RegistryResourceName == ""
//| where Repository == ""
//| where Digest == ""
| extend requestId = tostring(AdditionalData.HandleResult.RequestId)
| where EventType  contains "ImagePushed"
| order by GeneratedTimestamp
```

Look at the "ResultType" field - it's value should be ScanRequested

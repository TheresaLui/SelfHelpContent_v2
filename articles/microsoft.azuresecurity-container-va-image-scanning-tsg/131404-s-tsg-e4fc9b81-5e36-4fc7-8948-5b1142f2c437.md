# Unsupported classic registries

<!--issueDescription-->

After investigation, we are noticing from the back-end that there's an error in the scan because you're using a classic registry. Only ARM registries are supported for ACR vulnerability assessment. Please refer to this ACR FAQ.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

# Unsupported classic registries

<!--issueDescription-->

After investigation, we are noticing from the back-end that there's an error in the scan because you're using a classic registry. Only ARM registries are supported for ACR vulnerability assessment. Please refer to this [ACR FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-container-registries-introduction#faq-for-azure-container-registry-image-scanning).<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

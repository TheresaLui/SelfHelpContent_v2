###**Recommended steps**
To resolve common issues, try one or more of the following steps.

1. Review your VM's [console screenshot](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.VirtualMachineSerialConsoleLogBlade) to correct boot problems
2. Reset Remote Access to address remote server issues <br>
[Reset remote access using PowerShell or CLI](http://aka.ms/resetsarmwinremoteaccess)
3. Restart the Virtual Machine to address startup issues by clicking 'Restart' at the top of the VM resource blade
4. Address Azure host issues by [redeploying](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.VirtualMachineRedeploy), which will migrate the VM to a new Azure host
5. If you're getting an RDP license error, use 'mstsc/admin' as a work around. If needed, uninstall or buy an RDS license. <br>

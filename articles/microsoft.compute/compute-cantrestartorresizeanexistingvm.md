# I can't restart or resize an existing VM

## **Recommended Steps**

We are experiencing high demand for specific regions across the globe. 4 out of 5 customers resolved their allocation failure issue using the below steps.

For further information, please review our [commitment to customers and Microsoft Cloud Services continuity](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customers-and-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/).

We are currently experiencing high demand in **West Europe, North Europe, UK South, UK West, and France Central**. If you are having availibility issues, please try alternate regions (as first preference) or alternate SKUs.

For general troubleshooting, please follow these guides:<br>

1. Understand your specific error ([SkuNotAvailable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-sku-not-available), [Quota Limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-resource-quota), or [Allocation Failure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/allocation-failure))<br>
2. Deploy to another region
3. Use another size in the given region ([Resize a Windows VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/resize-vm) or [Resize a Linux VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/change-vm-size))

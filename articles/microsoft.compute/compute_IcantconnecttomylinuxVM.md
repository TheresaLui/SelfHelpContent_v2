 ###**Recommended steps**
 To resolve common issues, try one or more of the following steps.
 
 1. Review your VM's [console screenshot or logs](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.VirtualMachineSerialConsoleLogBlade) to correct boot problems. Review errors in the logs such as FSTAB (file systems table), FSCK (file system consistency), or networking
 2. Reset Password to address authentication errors <br>
 [Reset Password using CLI or PowerShell](http://aka.ms/resetarmpass)
 3. Restart the Virtual Machine to address startup issues by clicking 'Restart' at the top of the VM resource blade
 4. Address any Azure host issues by [redeploying](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.VirtualMachineRedeploy), which will migrate the VM to a new Azure host
 5. Reset the SSH connection and configuration to fix SSH issues <br>
 [Reset SSH connection using CLI or PowerShell](http://aka.ms/resetarmssh)

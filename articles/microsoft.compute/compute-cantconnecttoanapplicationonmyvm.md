# I can't connect to an application on my VM

## **Recommended steps**
First ensure you are able to RDP or SSH to the VM and then try the following steps.

1. Verify the application is listening on the expected ports and endpoints <br>
Use 'netstat -a' to show the active listening ports on the VM and check the endpoints ACL rules for public and private ports.
2. Test application access from different VMs <br>
Try to access the application from a different virtual machine in the same virtual network, and test the VMs in different subnets. If you can't access it, check the host firewall and [network security group configurations] (data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Network.EffectiveSecurityRulesBlade).
3. Test external application access <br>
Try to access the application from a computer outside of the virtual network. If you can't access it, check the external load balancer configuration, endpoint (TCP or UDP), [network security group] (data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Network.EffectiveSecurityRulesBlade), and NAT configuration.

# I can't connect to an application on my VM

## **Recommended steps**
First ensure you are able to RDP or SSH to the VM and then try the following steps.

1. Verify the application is listening on the expected ports and endpoints <br>
Use 'netstat -a' to show the active listening ports on the VM and check the endpoints ACL rules for public and private ports
2. Test application access from different VMs <br>
Try to access the application from a different virtual machine in the same virtual network, and test the VMs in different subnets. If you can't access it, check the host firewall and network security group configurations.
3. Test external application access <br>
Try to access the application from a computer outside of the virtual network. If you can't access it, check the external load balancer configuration, endpoint (TCP or UDP), network security group, and NAT configuration.

# TooManyRequests issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

The total number of request units consumed is more than the provisioned request-unit rate for the collection and has been throttled.
<br>Consider scaling the throughput assigned to a container or a set of containers from the Azure portal or you can retry the operation.

Thank you.

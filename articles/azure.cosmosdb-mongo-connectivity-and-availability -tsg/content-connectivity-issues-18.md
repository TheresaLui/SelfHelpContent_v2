# Connectivity Issues

Please use this TSG for the following errors thrown by the MongoDB tools/drivers/

Closed connection [connectionId{localValue:<>, serverValue:<>}] to <>:10255 because there was a socket exception raised by this connection.
com.mongodb.MongoSocketWriteException: Exception sending message
 
##Getting the server connectionId from the client logs

With the v36 release, MongoDB service assigns a unique identifier to each connection and send this value to the client, which then logs it in its client log. This makes it very easy to correlate a client side connection with the server side connection.

- Ask the customer to enable connection logging for their driver based on the below references
- If logging was already enabled, get the driver logs from the customer and identify the connection that was faulty
 
e.g. The logs shared by the customer should have events as follows

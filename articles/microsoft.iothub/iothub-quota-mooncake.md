# Manage your IoT Hub pricing or scale

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To upgrade IoT hub to a higher tier, go to [Pricing and scale](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.IotHubPricingAndScaleBlade.id.$resourceId), and [choose a tier](https://docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/iot-hub/iot-hub-scaling)
2. It is [not currently possible](https://www.azure.cn/pricing/details/iot-hub/) to upgrade from IoT Hub free edition (F1) to one of the paid editions. For a workaround, use [ARM templates](https://docs.azure.cn/azure-resource-manager/manage-resources-powershell) to create a paid IoT hub with the same settings, and import device identities from the free IoT hub with our [bulk device management API](https://docs.azure.cn/iot-hub/iot-hub-bulk-identity-mgmt).
3. For other types of quota increases, like maximum units, number of hubs in a subscription, or maximum device count, please open a support request.

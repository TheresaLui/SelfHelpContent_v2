# How do I keep track of device connection state reliably and quickly?

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To quickly and reliably keep track of device connection state, we recommend subscribing to the device connection events on Event Grid:

	* [IoT Hub and Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-event-grid#event-types)<br>
	* [Order device connection events from Azure IoT Hub using Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-how-to-order-connection-state-events)

**Note**: The `connectionState` field in IoT Hub identity registry is only for debugging and development purposes: [Understanding the IoT Hub device registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#device-heartbeat)

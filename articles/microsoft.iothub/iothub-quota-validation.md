# Quota validation issues

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you think that you hit the message quota sooner than expected (403 IotHubQuotaExceeded), it might be because you're on the free (F1) edition, which has a smaller chunking limit at 0.5KB (as opposed to 4KB for the paid editions): [Understand IoT Hub quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling)
1. [Unfortunately, it's not possible to upgrade from free IoT Hub to paid](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/). For a workaround, use [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template-powershell) to create a paid IoT hub with the same settings, and import device identities from the free IoT hub with our [bulk device management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-bulk-identity-mgmt).<br>

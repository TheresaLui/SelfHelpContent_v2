# Not sure why I got throttled or ran out of quota

## **Recommended Steps**

**Common reasons for unexpectedly hitting daily quota include:**

* If you're using free (F1) edition IoT Hub, it has a smaller message meter size at 0.5 KB (as opposed to 4KB for the paid editions). This might cause you to hit daily quota sooner than expected. [Unfortunately, it's not possible to upgrade from free IoT Hub to paid](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/). <br>
* Typically each file upload uses two messages, one for initiation and one for completion.<br>
* Twin reads, writes, and queries are metered in 0.5-KB chunks as opposed of 4 KB.<br>

**Common questions with IoT Hub throttling include:**

* If you **didn't get 429 errors but think you've been throttled**, it might be because IoT Hub only sends 429 ThrottlingException when the limit has been violated for too long. To learn more, see [Traffic shaping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling#traffic-shaping).
* If you got **JobQuotaExceededException** with device import or export jobs, it's because you can only have one active import or export job at any point in time.

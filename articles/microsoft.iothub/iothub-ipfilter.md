# Issues with configuring IP filters

Starting on Jan 21, 2022, IoT Hub is rolling out a new, upgraded version of IP Filter, which is more secure and works with the built-in endpoint. To avoid service disruption, please upgrade before Feb. 1, 2022. To learn more, see [upgrade from classic IP filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-ip-filter-classic).

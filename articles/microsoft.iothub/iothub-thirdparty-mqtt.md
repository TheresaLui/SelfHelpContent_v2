# How to use a third party MQTT client with an IoT Hub

## **Recommended Steps**

* IoT Hub is not a full-featured MQTT broker and does not support all the behaviors specified in the [MQTT v3.1.1 standard](http://mqtt.org). To learn more, visit
[Communicate with your IoT hub using the MQTT protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-mqtt-support#using-the-mqtt-protocol-directly).

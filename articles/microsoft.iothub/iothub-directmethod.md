# IoT Hub direct method issues  

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Try sending a direct method to the device using the [IoT Devices tab](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.DeviceExplorerBlade.id.$resourceId)
1. Try sending a direct method to a different device
1. Review [operational limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling#other-limits) and [throttling limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling#operation-throttles) that apply to direct methods
1. If you have [logs turned on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitor-resource-health#direct-methods), check for common issues under the category DirectMethods:

**404103 DeviceNotOnline** 

The device isn't reachable during the timeout period or if the device crashed/disconnected during the direct method request.

**404001 DeviceNotFound** 

The device isn't registered with IoT Hub. To fix, register the device.

**504101 GatewayTimeout** 

The device is online, but didn't respond during the timeout period.

**401002 AuthenticationFailed** 

Either the authentication expired or the specified device isn't found.

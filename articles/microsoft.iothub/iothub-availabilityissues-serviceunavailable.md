# Is IoT Hub having service issues?

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you're seeing 500xxx errors (i.e. 500001 ServerError), the issue is likely temporary. Make sure your device can automatically retry: [How to manage connectivity and reliable messaging using Azure IoT Hub device SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-reliability-features-in-sdks#connection-and-retry)
2. If the issue persists, check [Azure Resource Health](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_support.resourcehealthdetailblade) and [Azure Service Health](data-blade:hubsextension.serviceshealthblade) to see if there's a known issue on our side
3. If the issue persists, consider [a manual failover of your IoT Hub to the geo-paired region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/tutorial-manual-failover)

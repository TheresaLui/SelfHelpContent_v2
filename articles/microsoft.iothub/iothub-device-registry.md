# Can't create, update, or delete devices

## **Recommended Steps**

* Review the limits on device identity operations to make sure that you're under them:

	* **Create, retrieve, list, update, or delete device identities**: 83.33/sec/unit (5,000/min/unit) for B3 and S3; 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) for all other tiers
	* **Device count**: The maximum number of devices you can register to a single IoT hub is 1,000,000. The only way to increase this limit is to contact Microsoft Support.
	* **Device import and export jobs**: IoT Hub only allows 1 device import/export job to run at a time

* If you have [logs turned on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitor-resource-health#cloud-to-device-commands), check for errors under the DeviceIdentitiesOperations category

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Understand and manage the device identity registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry)<br>

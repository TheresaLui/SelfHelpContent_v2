# Account cannot be moved to the target region

<!--issueDescription-->

We are unable to whitelist the subscription in the target region for the preview feature [feature name]  which exists in the source storage account/region.

If this was a powershell/cli command error, then follow the command reference troubleshooting guide to determine the cause of error.

If the Product team has not approved the whitelisting, please ask for the Cx ready RCA from the Product team as well, and respond the same to the Cx.

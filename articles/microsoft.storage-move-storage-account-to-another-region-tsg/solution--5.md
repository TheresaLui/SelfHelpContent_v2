<!--issueDescription-->

**Please provide the following response to the customer based on the feature that is not supported in the target region.**

We have completed the review for your request to move the storage account to a different region. However, we are unable to move this storage account, since the feature [feature name] which exists in the source storage account "[source account name]" is not supported in the target region [target region name]. Please contact us back, when the feature is available in the target region.

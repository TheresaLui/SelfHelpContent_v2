# I'm hitting quota limits for my IoT hub

If you reach the IoT Hub message quota (403 IoTHubQuotaExceeded), consider upgrading your IoT Hub to a higher tier to suit the needs of your solution.

## **Recommended steps**

* To upgrade IoT hub to a higher tier, go to [Pricing and scale](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.IotHubPricingAndScaleBlade.id.$resourceId), and [choose a tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-scaling)
* It is not currently possible to upgrade from IoT Hub free edition (F1) to one of the paid editions. For a workaround, use [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-export-template-powershell) to create a paid IoT hub with the same settings, and import device identities from the free IoT hub with our [bulk device management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-bulk-identity-mgmt).
* You can ask for other types of quota increases, like maximum units, number of hubs in a subscription, or maximum device count, in a support request.

# The iotedged service is in a failed state

If the IoT Edge service is reporting a failed state, there are several possible causes, including an error in the connection string, firewall connection errors, the container engine not running, or more. IoT Edge has a built-in troubleshooting tool that was developed to check all these common errors for you at once. 

## **Recommended steps**

Run the IoT Edge troubleshooting tool on your IoT Edge device.

* On Linux devices: `sudo iotedge check --verbose`
* On Windows devices: `iotedge check --verbose`

# The Azure portal doesn't report IoT Edge modules as running

There are several ways to check whether a module is running on your IoT Edge device. If the status reported in the Azure portal doesn't seem correct, use these other methods to inspect your module.

## **Recommended steps**

* Use the [Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools) or the [Azure IoT Edge tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsc-iot.vs16iotedgetools) extensions to monitor and manage your IoT Edge devices and modules. 
* Use a direct method to ping the IoT Edge agent and get its status. For example, with the Azure CLI, `az iot hub invoke-module-method --method-name "ping" -n <hub name> -d <device name> -m '$edgeAgent'`.
* On the IoT Edge device, use the command `iotedge list` to check the status of all modules on the device. If your module is not running, use the command `iotedge logs <module name>` to get more information.
* For ongoing reporting, consider using Event Grid to monitor connect and disconnect events.

# Loses connection to IoT Hub over time

If your IoT Edge device was running successfully for a while, then eventually loses its connection to IoT Hub, something in your configuration may be blocking the connection or you may be running an older version of IoT Edge. 

## **Recommended Steps**

* On the IoT Edge device, run the command **iotedge check --verbose**. Look particularly at the results of the connectivity checks. 
* Check the version of IoT Edge on your device by running the command `iotedge --version`. Update your device to version 1.0.7-1 or newer to take advantage of an SDK fix for intermittent connectivity issues.

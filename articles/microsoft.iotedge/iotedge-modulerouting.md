# Messages aren't being routed between modules

IoT Edge uses routing to connect message inputs and outputs of individual modules so that you can create communication pipelines in your deployments. Use these steps to troubleshoot routing errors. 

## **Recommended Steps**

* Turn on debug logs for the IoT Edge hub to see if you're getting **sent** and **received** confirmations for each module. For more information, see [View the messages going through the IoT Edge hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#view-the-messages-going-through-the-iot-edge-hub).
* Inspect each of the modules to see if they're successfully sending messages
* Double check the routes in your deployment manifest. Pay particular attention to the following common errors:

	* Do the names of the modules in your route match the actual names of the modules running on your device?
  	* Does each named input and output exist in the correct module?

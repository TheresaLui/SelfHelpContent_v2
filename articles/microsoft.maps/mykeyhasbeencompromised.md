# My key has been compromised

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Navigate to the Keys blade in your Azure Maps account.
2. You’ll notice that your account is granted 2 keys – primary and secondary. Begin using your secondary key immediately to reduce any service interruption.
3. In order to terminate the primary key, simply click the “Regenerate Primary Key” button on the Keys blade. A new primary key will be created and the compromised key will stop working immediately.

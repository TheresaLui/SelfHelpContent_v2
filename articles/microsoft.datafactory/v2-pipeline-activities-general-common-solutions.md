# V2 - Pipeline Activities - General Common Solutions

## **Recommended Documents**

* Copy Activity in Data Factory copies data from a source data store to a sink data store. Data factory supports several data stores (like Azure Blob storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL DB etc.) Check out implementation and examples of **[Supported Data Stores](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities#data-movement-activities)**.
* Implementation and examples of supported **[Transformation Activities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities#data-transformation-activities)** like Azure fucntion, Custom Activity etc.
* Implementation and examples of supported **[Control Flow Activites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities#control-flow-activities)** like Execute Pipeline, If condition activity etc.
* There are different types of **[Triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers)** (scheduler trigger, which allows pipelines to be triggered on a wall-clock schedule, as well as manual trigger, which triggers pipelines on-demand). Check out the how to guide to create triggers:

     * **[Manual Execution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers#manual-execution-on-demand)**
     * **[Schedule Trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-schedule-trigger)**

# V2 - Author and Develop - ADF Portal not Loading

## **Recommended Steps**

* Officially supported web browsers:
  * Officially supported web browsers for ADF are _Microsoft Edge_ and _Google Chrome_
  * For Data Factory V2, please use either one to access [_Azure Data Factory UI Portal_](https://adf.azure.com)

* If the ADF UI portal does not load or you are redirected to a blank page, _https://adf.azure.com/accesstoken.html_, please __enable__ third-party cookies options on your browser using the following steps found on [Troubleshoot ADF UX Issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-ux-troubleshoot-guide):
  * ADF portal uses browser Cookies to persist user session and enable interactive development and monitoring experiences
  * For _Microsoft Edge_,  please go to __Settings and More ...__ > __Settings__ > __Site permissions__ > __Cookies and site data__ to make the change, make sure **Block third party cookies** is **disabled**, you can also add the site __adf.azure.com__ on the **Allow** section by clicking the button **Add**
  * For _Google Chrome_, please visit __chrome://settings/content/cookies__ to make the change, make sure **Block third party cookies** is **disabled**, you can also add the site __adf.azure.com__ on the **Allow** section by clicking the button **Add**
  * If you disabled browser popup, check whether your browser address bar has some blocked popup. If yes, allow it. 

* If the ADF UI portal is slow or not as responsive, check if your browser version is too old. Upgrading to newer version could boost the UI performance.

# Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (Data Management Gateway) fails to copy data to/from an on-premises data store

## **Recommended steps**

- You can find detailed information in Integration Runtime logs in Windows event logs. You can find them by using Windows **Event Viewer** under **Application and Services Logs** > **Integration Runtime** While troubleshooting IR related issues look for error level events in the event viewer.
- If you see data store connection or driver related errors, launch **Integration Runtime (configuration manager)** on the host machine, switch to the **Diagnostics** tab, select/enter appropriate values for fields in the **Test connection** group, and click **Test** to see if you can connect to on-premises data source  from the gateway machine using the connection information and credentials. If the test connection still fails after you install a driver, restart the IR for it to pick up the latest change.

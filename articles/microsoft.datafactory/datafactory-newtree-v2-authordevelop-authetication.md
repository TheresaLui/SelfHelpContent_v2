# Permissions and Azure Roles for Data Factory

## **Recommended Steps**

- For access control and security purposes, Azure Data Factory requires users to have certain permissions to perform certain tasks <br/>
- Please refer to [Azure roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal#prerequisites) section for high level explanation <br/>
- For detailed explanation, please refer to [Roles and permissions for Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions) page <br/>
- We recommend you consider the built-in [Data Factory Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor) for data factory resources <br/>

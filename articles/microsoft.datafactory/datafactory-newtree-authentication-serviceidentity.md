# Generate and Retrieve Service Identity for ADF

__Note__: Data factory service identity is based upon _managed identities for Azure resources_. For more information about managed identities, please refer to [Managed Identities for Azure Resources Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)

## **Recommended Steps**

If you find that your data factory doesn't have a _service identity_ associated, following the steps in [_Retrieve service identity_](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity#retrieve-service-identity) section, you can explicitly generate one following the steps in [_Generate service identity_](ttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity#generate-service-identity) section

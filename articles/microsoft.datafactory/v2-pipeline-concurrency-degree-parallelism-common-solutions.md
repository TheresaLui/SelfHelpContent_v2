# V2 - Pipeline or trigger execution issues - pipeline concurrency or degree of parallelism

## Recommended Steps

### Self-hosted integration runtime scalability

To host increasing concurrent workload or to achieve higher performance, you can either scale up or scale out the Self-hosted Integration Runtime. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance-features#self-hosted-integration-runtime-scalability).

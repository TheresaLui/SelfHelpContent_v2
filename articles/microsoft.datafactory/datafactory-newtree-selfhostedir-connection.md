# Self-Hosted Integration Runtime fails to copy data to/from an on-premises data store

## **Recommended Steps**

* You can find detailed information in Integration Runtime logs in Windows event logs. You can find them under **Event Viewer** > **Application and Services Logs** > **Microsoft Integration Runtime**. To troubleshoot IR related issuesï¼Œplease look for error level events in the event viewer <br>
* If you see data store connection or driver related errors, launch Configuration Manager on the host machine, switch to the **Diagnostics** tab, select/enter appropriate values for fields in the **Test connection** group, and click **Test** to see if you can connect to on-premises data source  from the gateway machine using the connection information and credentials <br>
* If you recently install a driver, please restart the IR for it to pick up the latest changes <br>

* Firewall and proxy related issues: [possible symptoms and error messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#possible-symptoms-for-firewall-and-proxy-server-related-issues) <br>
  * Please ensure ports are white listed for both central _corporate_ firewall and local machine _Windows_ firewall. For more details, [Firewall Whitelisting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#ports-and-firewall) <br>
  * If your IR uses proxy server, please refer to [Proxy Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#proxy-server-considerations) <br>

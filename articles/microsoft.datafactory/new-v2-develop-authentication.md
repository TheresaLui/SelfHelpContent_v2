# Permissions and Azure Roles for Data Factory

## **Recommended Steps**

- For access control and security purposes, Azure Data Factory requires users to have certain permissions to perform certain tasks <br/>
- Please refer to [Azure roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal#prerequisites) section for high level explanation <br>
- For detailed explanation, please refer to [Roles and permissions for Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions) <br>
- We recommend you consider the built-in [Data Factory Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor) for data factory resources <br/>
- **NOTES**: to create and manage child resources for Data Factory - including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes - the following requirements are applicable:
  - To create and manage child resources in the Azure portal, you must belong to __Data Factory Contributor__ role at the _resource group_ level or above
  - To create and manage child resources with PowerShell or SDK, __contributor__ role at _resource_ level or above is sufficient
  - To have more granular access control for ADF portal users, please consider create a separate resource group for your data factory

# V2 - Alerts Common Solutions

## **Recommended Steps**

There are 2 ways to raise alerts for Azure Data Factory.

1. Raise alerts within Data Factory:

    1. This allows users to monitor activities within _one_ factory
    1. You can set up the alerts from your Data Factory UI
    1. Document: [Set Up Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/monitor-visually#alerts)

1. Raise alerts through Azure Monitor:

    1. This allows you to monitor activities across _multiple_ factories
    1. You need to integrate with Azure Monitor to utilize the features
    1. Alert state needs to be reset to _Closed_ once fired, otherwise successive issue would not raise new alert. More resource is here [Manage alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview#manage-alerts)
    1. Documents: [Monitor Metrics with Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/monitor-using-azure-monitor#monitor-data-factory-metrics-with-azure-monitor) and [Set Up Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/monitor-visually#alerts)
	1. Subjects to rate limit as described in [Azure Monitor service limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits)

# Data Factory Limits

## **Recommended Steps**
- Some default limits can be increased per customer requests <br/>
- However, some limits, including bytes per object for pipeline objects, can not be increased above the default <br/>
- Please refer the documentation link below for up-to-date information <br/>
- If you hit the bytes per object for pipeline objects limit, we recommend you split the pipeline into several smaller pipelines.

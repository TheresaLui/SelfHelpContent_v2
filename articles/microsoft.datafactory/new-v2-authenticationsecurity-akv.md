# Store Credential in Azure Key Vault

__Note__: This feature relies on data factory service identity. Please make sure your data factory has one associated. See [_ADF Service Identity_](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity) for how to generate and retrieve ADF service identity.

## **Recommended Steps**

To reference a stored credential stored in Azure Key Vault, you need to:

1. Retrieve data factory service identity
1. Grant the service identity access to your Azure Key Vault
1. Create a linked service pointing to your Azure Key Vault
1. Create data store linked service, inside which reference the corresponding secret stored in key vault

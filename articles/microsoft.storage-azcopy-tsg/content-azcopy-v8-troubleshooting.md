# AzCopy V8 Troubleshooting

1. We should always advise v10 as alternate solution. However, if the customer insists we should provide support for older versions. 
2. Why? The devs are not actively maintaining v8 at all. Hence, no updates to the product or documentation. 

## Recommended Documents

1. [Transfer data with the AzCopy v8.1 on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/storage/storage-use-azcopy)
2. [Transfer data with AzCopy v8.1 on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/storage/storage-use-azcopy-linux)

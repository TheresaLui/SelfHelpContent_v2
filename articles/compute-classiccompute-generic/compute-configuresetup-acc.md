# Azure Confidential Computing

You can now build, deploy, and run applications that protect data confidentiality and integrity in the cloud. To get started, deploy a DC-series VM through the custom deployment flow in [Azure Marketplace](https://aka.ms/ccvm).

ACC VMs are only available in **East US** and **West Europe** regions currently.

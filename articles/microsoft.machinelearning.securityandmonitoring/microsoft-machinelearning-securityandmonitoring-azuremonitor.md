# Azure Monitor

Azure Machine Learning logs monitoring data using Azure Monitor, which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Machine Learning collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources, which are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data). 

## **Recommended Steps**

Below are steps for common tasks you might want accomplish using Azure Monitor.

### **Metrics**

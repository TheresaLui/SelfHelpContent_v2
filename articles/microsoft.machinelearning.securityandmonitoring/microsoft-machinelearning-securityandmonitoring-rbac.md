# Role based access (RBAC) for workspace resources

An Azure Machine Learning workspace is an Azure resource. Like other Azure resources, when a new Azure Machine Learning workspace is created, it comes with three default roles. 

| Role | Access level |
| --- | --- |
| **Reader** | Read-only actions in the workspace. Readers can list and view assets in a workspace, but can't create or update these assets. |
| **Contributor** | View, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) assets in a workspace. For example, contributors can create an experiment, create or attach a compute cluster, submit a run, and deploy a web service. |
| **Owner** | Full access to the workspace, including the ability to view, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) assets in a workspace. Additionally, you can change role assignments. |

## Recommended Steps

If you're an owner of a workspace, you can add and remove roles for the workspace. You can also assign roles to users. Use the following links to discover how to manage access:

- [Azure portal UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli)
- [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-rest)
- [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-template)


If the built-in roles are insufficient, you can create custom roles. See the [following article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) to learn more.

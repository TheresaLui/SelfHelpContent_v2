# Policies

Azure Policy can be used to create and assign policies which can be used for implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. You can use one of the two recommended steps below in order to do so.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Built-in policies**

Azure ML includes a list of [built-in policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/policy-reference#built-in-policy-definitions) which can be assigned through Azure Policy. For instructions on assigning policies, see the following [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-portal).

### **Custom policies**

If the built-in policies do not work, you can also create custom policy definitions through Azure Policy. For instructions on creating customer policies, see the following [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition)


## **Recommended Documents**

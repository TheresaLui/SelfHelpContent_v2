# Virtual Network Configuration

## **Recommended Steps**

A virtual network acts as a security boundary, isolating your Azure resources from the public internet. To ensure your workspace, training jobs, and inferencing jobs all remain secured behing a virtual network, the follow steps should be taken:

1. Ensure your workspace is behind an Azure Private Link, which enables you to connect to your workspace using a private endpoint. This will limit access to your workspace to only occur over a set of private IP addresses inside your virtual network.
2. Ensure all other Azure resources associated with your workspace are created within a virtual network (storage accounts, compute targets, key vaults etc). 

### **Setup Private Link on Workspace**

For instructions on how to create and use a private link enabled workspace, see the following [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-private-link).

### **Setup Virtual Network on Associated Azure Resources**

For instructions on how to ensure all your associated resources are created behind virtual networks, see the following [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-enable-virtual-network).

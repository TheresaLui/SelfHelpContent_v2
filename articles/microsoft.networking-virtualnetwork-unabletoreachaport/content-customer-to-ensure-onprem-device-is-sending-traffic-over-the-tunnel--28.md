# Customer to ensure onprem device is sending traffic over the tunnel.

After confirming that the traffic is successfully passing through the VPN gateway the traffic is heading towards the customers local routing device.  It will be important that the customer's device is configured to accept and forward this traffic. 

If the customer is unable to do so it may be necessary to join a call with their device's vendor to help resolve the issue.

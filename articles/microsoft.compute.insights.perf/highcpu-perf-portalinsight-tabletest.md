# **Instances of High CPU detected on the VM in last 24 hrs**

## **Do you know there were several High CPU instances on this <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> in last 24 hrs?**

<!--issueDescription-->
Our diagnostics show there were several instances where Average Max CPU counter on this VM was above 85%. The calculations are based on Average Max CPU counter data for last 24 hrs, where it has been consistently above 85% for in 10 minute time window.

**What can cause CPU spike on a VM?**

* The load pattern is compute intensive, in which case the consistent spikes are expected
* Was there a recent code change which might be causing this behavior?
* Was there a recent change in number of users or spike in amount of data processing?
* Does it correlate with a job processing e.g. maintenance, indexing, cube processing, end of day reporting?
* A system process after a recent OS patch, could be driving high CPU consumption

## **Recommended Steps**

**Detection: If you are unaware of the process driving high CPU consumption, for the machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->, you can [access PerfInsights here](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.PerformanceDiagnosticsBlade.resourceId.$resourceId;data-blade-uri:{$domain}/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/{$resourceIdDecoded}/performanceDiagnostics)** and review results directly from the Azure portal. You may also [download PerfInsights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/performance-diagnostics#install-and-run-performance-diagnostics-on-your-vm) and run it in your virtual machine. PerfInsights generates a report that contains a dedicated tab for CPU analysis.

If you are unable to access your virtual machine via RDP or SSH you can try restarting to temporarily regain access, then proceed to troubleshoot using [PerfInsights](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Compute.PerformanceDiagnosticsBlade.resourceId.$resourceId;data-blade-uri:{$domain}/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/{$resourceIdDecoded}/performanceDiagnostics) to determine what is causing the CPU spike.

**If it's expected due to the kind of data or user pattern, then it is recommended to resize to a higher VM SKU**. You can read more about different [Azure Virtual Machine offerings](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/) and decide on which Virtual Machine offering best suits your workload.

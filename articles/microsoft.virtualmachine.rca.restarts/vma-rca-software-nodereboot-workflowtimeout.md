# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> The host node reboot was triggered by our Azure monitoring systems, which detected that the physical node was not successfully responding to VM operations.
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> VMs that could be relocated to different, healthy nodes were automatically moved before the host node was rebooted and the unhealthy node has been taken out of service.  VM Services were restored following the reboot.

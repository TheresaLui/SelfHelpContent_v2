## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.

<!--/resolutionDetails-->

<!--additionalInfo-->
### **Additional Information**
> If the physical node is impacted again within 7 days, the node will be taken out of production for hardware diagnosis and repair. We request that you contact us if the issue occurs again. Our core platform engineers are aware of this issue and are working closely with hardware teams to minimize these failures.

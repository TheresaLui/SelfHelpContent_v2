# Your resource took a little longer to update

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated memory-preserving update action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The update process succeeded but your VM was unavailable longer than the expected maximum duration of 30 seconds. RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed during this time.<br>

This update is part of the maintenance routinely performed on the underlying hosts for this VM. During these updates, the VM is frozen for up to 30 seconds and then resumed. Our engineers are alerted to investigate all factors and address issues that could have caused this update to exceed its maximum duration. To learn more about our maintenance and update process, see [Maintenance for virtual machines in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-planned-maintenance/).<br>

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. To learn more about high availability options, refer to the following articles:<br>

* [Manage the availability of virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-manage-availability)<br>
* [Configure availability of virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-how-to-configure-availability)

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal. To learn more about Azure Resource Health, see [Understand and use Resource Health Center to troubleshoot this scenario in the future](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-health/resource-health-overview).<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.<br>

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, may have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> The host node reboot action was triggered by our Azure monitoring systems which detected a driver failure condition on the physical node where the virtual machine was hosted. This caused your VM to get rebooted.
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> VM was restored following reboot of the host node.
> 
> Our core platform OS engineers have identified a fix for this issue and it's currently being deployed across Azure platform.

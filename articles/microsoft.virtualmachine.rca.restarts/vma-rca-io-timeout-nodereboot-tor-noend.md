# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> During this incident, a top of rack (ToR) network router connecting a single rack of servers reloaded after experiencing a hardware failure. This caused temporary IO transaction timeouts between the physical host node where your VM was running and the Azure Storage services where your Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) reside, resulting in an Azure initiated VM restart.
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> VM was restored following reboot of the host node.
> 
<!--/resolutionDetails-->

<!--additionalInfo-->
### **Additional Information**
> The Azure platform continuously monitors reads and writes (IO transactions) from your VMs to Azure Storage. If transactions do not complete successfully within 120 seconds (inclusive of retries), the connectivity is considered to be lost and a temporary VM shutdown is initiated. This is done to preserve data integrity and prevent corruption of your VM. After the platform detects that the storage service connectivity is restored, the VM is automatically restarted.

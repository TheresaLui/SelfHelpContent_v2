# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### *Root Cause*
> We identified that the host node where the VM was running was experiencing a transient platform issue during routine background operations. The background operations activity exposed a Host OS issue, where heavy I/O to local disk impacted the VMs. On the physical node, local disk errors were observed. Our core OS engineers are currently evaluating a solution for this platform issue.

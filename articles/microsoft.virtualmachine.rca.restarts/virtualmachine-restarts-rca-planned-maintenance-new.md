# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This expected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated planned maintenance action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

This planned maintenance update required a reboot of your virtual machines to apply the required updates to the infrastructure. The VM was shut down while we patched the infrastructure, and then restarted.

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### *Root Cause*
> Microsoft Azure team has finished investigating the issue with your virtual machine. The physical host node where your VM was running was undergoing a regular maintenance of the networking stack. This impacted connectivity briefly.
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### *Resolution*
> VM Services were restored following the reboot. Our core engineers are working on improving the platform to minimize such occurrences.
> 
<!--/resolutionDetails-->

<!--additionalInfo-->
### *Additional Information*
> Azure periodically performs updates to improve the reliability, performance, and security of the host infrastructure for virtual machines. There is an expected downtime during these updates.

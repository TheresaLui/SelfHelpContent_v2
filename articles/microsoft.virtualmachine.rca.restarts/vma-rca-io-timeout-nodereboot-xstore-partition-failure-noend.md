# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### *Root Cause*
> This unexpected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated VM shutdown** triggered by detection of **temporary IO transaction timeouts** between the physical host node where your VM was running and the Azure Storage services where your Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) reside. The IO timeouts occurred due to a load balancing operation that took longer than expected.
> 
> Azure platform continuously monitors reads and writes (IO transactions) from your VMs to Azure Storage. If transactions do not complete successfully within 120 seconds (inclusive of retries), the connectivity is considered to be lost and a temporary VM shutdown is initiated to preserve data integrity and prevent corruption of your VM. After the platform detects that the storage service connectivity is restored, the VM is automatically restarted.

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### *Resolution*
> Azure Storage is a multitenant environment, which means there are multiple storage accounts being served by a single storage cluster. Azure Storage uses a partitioning system that automatically load balances partitions across multiple servers in the cluster based on traffic. Load balancing identifies when a given partition server is resource constrained and reassigns one or more partition ranges to less utilized partition servers. This operation took a longer time to complete than normally expected. After the operation completed, the data in the partition became available and VM availability was restored.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> The Host Node where the VM was running encountered a hardware issue involving local disk operations which impacted the VM.
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> VM was restored following reboot of the host node.
> 
<!--/resolutionDetails-->

<!--additionalInfo-->
### **Additional Information**
> The Hardware Engineering team is working on the following long-term fixes to reduce the impact of these errors:
> - Azure is continually working to make improvements to pre-production hardware screening.
> - Azure is continually making improvements to the firmware and software stack for error handling and recovery of disks to prevent node reboots.
> - Improvements to failure prediction telemetry and models.
> 
> We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> The temporary VM shutdown was triggered by our Azure monitoring systems that detected networking issues between the physical host node where your VM was running, and the Azure Storage services where your VHDs reside. As designed, this action was taken to preserve data integrity of your VM. After the node detected that conditions had improved, the VM was restarted.

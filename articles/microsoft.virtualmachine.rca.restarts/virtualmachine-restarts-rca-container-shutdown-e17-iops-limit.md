# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM <!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname--> became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**.
This unexpected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated VM shutdown** triggered by detection of **temporary IO transaction timeouts** between the physical host node where your VM was running, and the Azure Storage services where your Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) reside.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Azure Standard Storage disks have a limit of 500 IOPS for each VHD.  We have documented a few best practices for [Configuring Azure Virtual Machines for Optimal Storage Performance](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/10/14/configuring-azure-virtual-machines-for-optimal-storage-performance.aspx)<br> 

Depending on the workload, a striped disk or configuring Storage Spaces inside the Guest VM may help mitigate the issue.  You may also want to consider Premium Storage if the issue persists.<br>

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set.<br>

To learn more about high availability options, refer to the following articles:<br>

* [Manage the availability of virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-manage-availability)<br>
* [Configure availability of virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-how-to-configure-availability)<br>
* [Managed Disks Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview)

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal.<br>

To learn more about Azure Resource Health, see [Understand and use Resource Health Center to troubleshoot this scenario in the future](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-health/resource-health-overview).<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.<br>

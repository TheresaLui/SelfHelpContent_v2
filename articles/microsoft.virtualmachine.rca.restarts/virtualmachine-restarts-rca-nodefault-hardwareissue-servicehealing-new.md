# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM <!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname--> became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This unexpected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated auto-recovery action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The auto-recovery action was triggered by a hardware issue on the physical node where the virtual machine was hosted. As designed, your VM was automatically moved to a different and healthy physical node to avoid further impact. RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed during this time.<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.<br>

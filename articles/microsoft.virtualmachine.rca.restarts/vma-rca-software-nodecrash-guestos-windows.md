# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> This unexpected occurrence was caused by a crash in the VM's operating system due to due to internal checks in the virtual machine that caused the deployment to be terminated.
> 
> To avoid potential memory and disk data corruption, the guest operating system stops running when it detects a serious error condition. This condition can occur for many different reasons, including the following:
> 
> - A memory address that causes an access violation
> - An unexpected exception or trap
> - A faulting kernel mode driver
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> The VM recovered after the guest operating system crashed.

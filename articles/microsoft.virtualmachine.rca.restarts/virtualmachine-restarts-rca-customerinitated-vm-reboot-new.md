# Virtual Machine Connectivity Issue: VMA RCA

## We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM <!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname--> became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This expected occurrence was caused by a **user initiated reboot action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The reboot was triggered by an authorized user or process from either the Azure Portal or Azure Resource Manager interfaces. As a result, your VM was rebooted. RDP connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed during this time.<br>

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal.<br>

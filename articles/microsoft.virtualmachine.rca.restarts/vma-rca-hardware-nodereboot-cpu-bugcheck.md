# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## **VM Availability**
<!--issueDescription-->
The Azure monitoring and diagnostics systems identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. During this time RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

<!--rcaDescription-->
### **Root Cause**
> The Host Node where the VM was running encountered a **CPU Error** on the physical node where the virtual machine was hosted. 
> 

<!--resolutionDetails-->
### **Resolution**
> This node has been taken out of service for debugging and your VM has been transferred over to a different node.
> 
<!--/resolutionDetails-->

<!--additionalInfo-->
### **Additional Information**
> The Hardware Engineering team is working on the following long-term fixes to reduce the impact of these errors:
> - Azure is continually working to make improvements to pre-production hardware screening
> - Azure is continually working with manufacturers to identify and prevent failures through improvements in CPU microcode
> - Improvements to CPU failure handling to reduce or avoid impact to customers
> - Improvements to failure prediction telemetry and models
> 
> We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.

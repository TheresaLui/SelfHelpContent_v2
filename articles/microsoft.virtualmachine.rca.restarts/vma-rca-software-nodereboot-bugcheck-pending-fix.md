# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM **<!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname-->** became unavailable at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **<!--$EndTime--> EndTime <!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This unexpected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated host node reboot action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The host node reboot action was triggered by our Azure monitoring systems that detected a failure condition due to a **recently discovered platform bug** with the physical node where the virtual machine was hosted. This caused your VM to get rebooted. RDP and SSH connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM, could have failed during this time.

Our core platform engineers identified the bug and are currently working on a fix that will be deployed to all affected nodes.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
## **VM Availability incident diagnostic information for [vmname]<!--($vmname)-->:** ##
 
We identified that your VM became unavailable at **[StartTime]<!--($StartTime)--> (UTC)** and availability was restored at **[EndTime]<!--($EndTime)--> (UTC)**. This expected occurrence was caused by a **user initiated redeploy action**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

The redeploy action was triggered by an authorized user or process via either Azure Portal or Azure Resource Manager interfaces. As a result, your VM was moved to a different host node. This caused your VM to get rebooted. RDP connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM may have failed during this time.<br>
To learn more about this user initiated redeploy action, please refer to the following article:<br>

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal.<br>

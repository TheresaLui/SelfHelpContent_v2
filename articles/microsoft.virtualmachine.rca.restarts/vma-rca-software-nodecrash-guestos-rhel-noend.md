# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM <!--$vmname-->Virtual machine<!--/$vmname--> experienced downtime at **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**. This unexpected occurrence was caused by a crash in the VMâ€™s operating system due to due to internal checks in the virtual machine that caused the deployment to be terminated.
<!--/issueDescription-->

To avoid potential memory and disk data corruption, the guest operating system stops execution when it detects a serious error condition. This condition can occur for many different reasons, including the following:

- A memory address that causes an access violation
- An unexpected exception or trap
- A faulting kernel mode driver

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working to improve the platform to reduce incidences of virtual machine unavailability.

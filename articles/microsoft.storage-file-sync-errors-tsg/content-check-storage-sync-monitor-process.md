# How to check if the Storage Sync Monitor process is running

1. When you view the status of a server under Registered Servers, the server has a status of "Appears offline." OR
2. When I view the health of a server endpoint, the health status is "No Activity."
3. This issue can occur if the Storage Sync Monitor process is not running or the server is unable to communicate with our service due to a proxy or firewall.

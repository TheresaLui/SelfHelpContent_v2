# Azure Security Center Data and Storage SQL Common Solutions

SQL Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) provides a single go-to location for discovering, classifying and protecting sensitive data, managing your database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to the database. You can enable ATP on your entire database server and apply to all databases on the server.

SQL Vulnerability Assessment has some new and valuable capabilities:

- **Automated scheduled scans**. Configure SQL Vulnerability Assessment to automatically run a scan for you once a week and send you an email with a result summary.
- **Exportable report**. One click to create and download an Excel report of the complete assessment results.
- **Augmented rule set**. A broader set of checks covering both database and server-level vulnerabilities, which impact the overall security of the database system.
- **Scan history**. View a complete history of all scans run on a database, with an ability to drill down into the details of each historic scan result.

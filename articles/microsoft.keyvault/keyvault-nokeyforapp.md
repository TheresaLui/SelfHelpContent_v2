# Application Cannot Obtain or Use a Key
## **Recommended steps**

* Authorize an application to use a key or secret. Assume for this example that the service principal name (spn) is "yourSPN" and that the user principal name is "yourUPN".<br>
    ```
        az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --spn yourSPN --key-permissions decrypt sign
        az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --upn yourUPN --secret-permissions get
    ```
**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?

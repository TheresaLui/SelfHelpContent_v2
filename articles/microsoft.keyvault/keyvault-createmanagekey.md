# How to Create and Manage Keys
## **Recommended steps**

* Create a new key vault and a key inside the vault.<br>
[Key Vault Getting Started Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started)
* You can also create a key vault using the Azure Portal.<br>

**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>
[Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)
* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

# How to Set Key Vault Type for Azure Key Vault
## **Recommended steps**

* There are two different types of Key Vaults: "Premium" and "Standard". One example of a scenario where you would create a "Premium" vault would be if you have a vault subscription that supports creation of HSM-protected keys and you want to create HSM-protected keys.<br>

**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

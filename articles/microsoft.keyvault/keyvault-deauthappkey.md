# Authorizing and Deauthorizing Applications to Use Keys
## **Recommended steps**

* Authorizing Applications to Use Keys<br>
* Authorize an application to use a key or secret. Assume for this example that the service principal name (spn) is "yourSPN" and that the user principal name is "yourUPN".<br>
    ```
        az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --spn yourSPN --key-permissions decrypt sign
        az keyvault set-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --upn yourUPN --secret-permissions get
    ```
* Deauthorizing application to use keys.<br>
    ``` 
        az keyvault delete-policy --name 'ContosoKeyVault' --upn yourUPN
    ```

##Troublshooting

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

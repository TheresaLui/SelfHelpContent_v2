# How Configure an Application to Use Keys
## **Recommended Steps**

* [Using Azure Key Vault from a Web Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-use-from-web-application)<br>
* [Use an App Service Managed Identity to Access Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-identity)

**Troubleshooting**

* To see how to associate a certificate with an Azure AD application look at [Getting Started with Key Vault for Certificates](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2016/09/26/get-started-with-azure-key-vault-certificates/) <br>
* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>

	[Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

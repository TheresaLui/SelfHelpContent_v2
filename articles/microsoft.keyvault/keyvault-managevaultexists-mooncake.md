# Managing an Existing Key Vault
## **Recommended steps**

* Authorize an application to use a key or secret with these steps for [creating and managing a key vault with PowerShell](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-get-started)

**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?

    [Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)
* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?

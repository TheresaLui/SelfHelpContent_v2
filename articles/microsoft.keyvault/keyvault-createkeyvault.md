**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

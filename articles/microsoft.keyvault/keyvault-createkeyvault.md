# How to Create and Manage a Key Vault
## **Recommended Steps**

* [Create a Key Vault with CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2#create-a-key-vault)
* [Create a Key Vault with Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault)

### **Troubleshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?
	
	[Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?

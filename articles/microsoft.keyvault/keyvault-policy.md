# Policy For Azure Key Vault

## **Recommended Steps**

Azure Policy for Key Vault is a governance tool designed to help you manage your key vaults at scale.

* [Integrate Azure Key Vault with Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/azure-policy?tabs=certificates)

### **Troubleshooting**

* User Cannot Create a Policy Definition
    1. Dataplane policy for Key Vault is still in preview. **Custom policy definitions are not supported at this time.**
    1. For other policies, use a JSON Validator like JSON Lint to confirm the policy is valid JSON.
    1. You may be using a policy alias that is not supported. Run this command to get the updated list of supported aliases. Get-AzPolicyAlias -NamespaceMatch ‘Microsoft.KeyVault’ -ListAvailable

* Deny policy is not taking effect.
    1. It may take up to 1 hour after policy assignment for the deny effect to start working.
    1. Make sure that enforcement is set to "Enabled" and effect is set to "Deny." Both conditions need to be set.

* Audit policy is not showing results.
    1. Audit results may stay in the "Not Started" state or "0 out of 0" state for up to 24 hours after policy assignment.

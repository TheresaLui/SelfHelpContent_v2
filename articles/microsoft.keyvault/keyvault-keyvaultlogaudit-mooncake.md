# How to Logging and Auditing with Key Vault

## **Recommended Steps**

* Auditing with Key Vault: [Set up key vault with end-to-end key rotation and auditing](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-key-rotation-log-monitoring)

### **Troubleshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?

    * [Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have over 16 applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?

    * [Grant permission to many applications to access a key vault](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-group-permissions-for-apps)

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Creating and Managing Key Vault with Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2)
* [Creating and Managing Key Vault with PowerShell](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-overview)

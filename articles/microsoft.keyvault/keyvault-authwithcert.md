# Azure Key Vault Authentication with Certificate
## **Recommended Steps**

1. Create Service Principal with a Certificate
2. Give Service Principal Permission to Access your Key Vault
3. Access Key Vault with Service Principal and Certificate

### **Troubleshooting**

* Unauthorized access, access denied, forbidden, or similar error:

	The principal used doesn't have access to the resource it's trying to access. Grant the App Service's access to a resource.

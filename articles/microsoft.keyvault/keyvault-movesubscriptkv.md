# How to Change Key Vault Type for Azure Key Vault
## **Recommended steps**

* There are two different types of Key Vaults: "Premium" and "Standard". Here is an example of how to create a "Premium" and "Standard" key vault, respectively. One example of a scenario where you would create a "Premium" vault would be if you have a vault subscription that supports creation of HSM-protected keys and you want to create HSM-protected keys. Assume that your vault name is "myvault" and your resource group name is "yourResourceGroup".<br>
* Azure CLI 2.0:<br>
    ```
		az keyvault create --name 'myvault' --resource-group 'yourResourceGroup' --location 'East Asia' --sku 'Premium'
		az keyvault create --name 'myvault' --resource-group 'yourResourceGroup' --location 'East Asia' --sku 'Standard'
	```
* Azure PowerShell:<br>
	```
		New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName 'myvault' -ResourceGroupName 'yourResourceGroup' -Location 'East Asia' -SKU 'Premium'
		New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName 'myvault' -ResourceGroupName 'yourResourceGroup' -Location 'East Asia' -SKU 'Standard'
	```

##Troublshooting

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?<br>

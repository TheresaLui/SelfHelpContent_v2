# How to Logging and Auditing with Key Vault 
## **Recommended Steps**

* [Logging with Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-logging)
* [Key Vault Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/alert)
* [Secrets, Keys and Certificates lifetime monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/event-grid-logicapps)

### **Troubleshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?
	[Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have many applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows  access control 1024 entries, how can I achieve that?

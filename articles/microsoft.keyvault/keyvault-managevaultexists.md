# Managing an Existing Key Vault
## **Recommended Steps**

* [Create and manage Key Vault with CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2)<br>
* [Secure your Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-secure-your-key-vault)<br>

### Troubleshooting

* How can I backup key vault or key vault objects?<br>

	You can backup individual key vault objects ie. Backup Key, Backup Secret, Backup Certificate [Using Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/keyvault/backupkey), [Using Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.keyvault/backup-azurekeyvaultkey?view=azurermps-6.13.0). The backup command backs up all versions of each secret. If you have a secret with a large number of previous versions (more than 10), the request size might exceed the allowed maximum and the operation might fail.

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?<br>

	[Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. How can I add multiple access policies?<br>

    Key vault supports up to **1024** access policy entries, with each entry granting a distinct set of permissions to a particular security principal.

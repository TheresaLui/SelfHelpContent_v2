# How to Create and Manage a Key Vault

## **Recommended steps**

* Create a New Key Vault

    [Key Vault Getting Started Guide](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-get-started)

* You can also create a key vault using the Azure Portal.

    [Create a Key Vault with Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.cn/#create/Microsoft.KeyVault)

**Troublshooting**

* My subscription was moved from tenant A to tenant B. How do I change the tenant ID for my existing key vault and set correct ACLs for principals in tenant B?

    [Change a key vault tenant ID after a subscription move](https://docs.azure.cn/key-vault/key-vault-subscription-move-fix)

* I have several (over 16) applications that need to access a key vault. Since Key Vault only allows 16 access control entries, how can I achieve that?

# Develop with Azure Key Vault
## **Recommended Steps**

* [Developer's Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-developers-guide)

### **Troubleshooting**

* Unauthorized access, access denied, forbidden, or similar error: 

	The principal used doesn't have access to the resource it's trying to access. Grant the App Service's access to a resource.

# Getting 403 error code

### Symptom

Rest API call fails with 403 error.

### Troubleshooting & Solution

This usually means that the clientâ€™s request is formed correctly, but the REST API server refuses to honor it; the user does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.

- Since error indicates not enough permissions, check the token or  re-create token to re-test
- Check if  webapp or API service you are trying is not down by checking if there was [an outage during that period](http://status.databricks.com) 
- If issue persists, ask SME on Ava and create Databricks SF ticket if needed

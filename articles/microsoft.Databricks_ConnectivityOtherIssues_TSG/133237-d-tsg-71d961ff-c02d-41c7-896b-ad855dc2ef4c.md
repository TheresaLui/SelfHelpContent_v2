# Error fetching notebook snapshot

### Symptom

When you are running job with the notebook, you may get the error:

`Run result unavailable: job failed with error message: INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: You do not have View permission on <notebook-path>`

### Troubleshooting & Solution

This error means user does not have the permission to run this notebook:

- You can check the same on permission tab
- Confirm the job owner from job URL -> Advance -> Permission	
- Give permission to run the notebook explicitly to the user who wants to run this job. Also, check the job permission for the same if the user has access to run this job

- If issue persists or further assistance needed, ask SME on Ava and create Databricks SF ticket if needed.

# SCIM AD invalid credentails

### Symptom

Testing connection using SCIM AD fails with invalid credentails error.

### Troubleshooting & Solution

- Validate the PAT token (outside SCIM) 
- If the token is good and only fails from AD SCIM, please see [if the workspace is IP access list enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/ip-access-list#check-if-your-workspace-has-the-ip-access-list-feature-enabled). If IP access is enabled in workspace and customer still wants to have AD connect, it is important to note that IP access list does not support filtering the request based on the APP call. Customer can explore options in Azure conditional access, but will have to disable IP access whitelist in Databricks. Please reach out to AD team for the same. 
 	
### Next Steps

- If issue persists or further assistance needed, ask SME on Ava and involve AD/Network teams if needed.

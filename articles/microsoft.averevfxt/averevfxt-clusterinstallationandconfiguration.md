# Avere vFXT Cluster Installation and Configuration Issues

Most customers can resolve installation and configuration issues by following the [Avere vFXT for Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/).  You need to plan your deployment, fulfill prerequisites, and finally deploy the cluster.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Planning your deployment is important. If you haven't already, please spend time reviewing our document regarding [planning for your deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-deploy-plan).
2. If a step wasn't missed in the planning process, then a step may have been missed in the [preparation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-prereqs)
3. If you're sure that you've completed both planning and preparation, then you should have a smooth deployment. You may move onto the [actual creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-deploy) of the cluster.

# Avere vFXT Client Access Issues

Most client connectivity issues will be resolved by following these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Determine if the client can ping a client-facing IP address.  `ping <client-facing-IP-address>` from a Linux or Windows host.
2. If you are connecting via NFS, try connecting to the NFS TCP port (2049).  If you are connecting via SMB, try connecting to the SMB TCP port (445).  From Linux, `nc -zv <client-facing-IP-address> <port>`. From Windows, `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <client-facing-IP-address> -Port <port>`
3. If the above connectivity tests fail, then you need to [troubleshoot network connectivity between your client and the Avere vFXT](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-troubleshoot-connectivity-problem-between-vms)
4. If you have basic network connectivity to the server, try to verify that filesystem services are running on the remote node.  If Linux, run `rpcinfo <client-facing-IP-address>; showmount -e <client-facing-IP-address>`.  On Windows, connectivity tests may harder if the problem is an authentication problem.  A simple connectivity test with Windows is `net view \\<client-facing-IP-address>`
5. If you've verified basic connectivity and that file system services are running, validate that the Avere vFXT cluster is healthy by visiting its management UI and checking for alerts

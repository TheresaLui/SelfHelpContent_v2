# Avere vFXT Networking Issues

Please consider the following information when dealing with a network connectivity issue.

## **Debugging with Ping**

First, if this is a problem that involves clients accessing the Avere vFXT cluster, please re-categorize this issue under the "Client Access Issues" support topic.

All Avere vFXT nodes are pingable.  You may test network connectivity by running the `ping` command in order to determine if network interfaces are responding.  Sometimes it is helpful to debug a Linux VM in the VNet and subnet that contains the Avere vFXT cluster.  You may also benefit by testing connectivity from your on-premises network by sourcing `ping` packets from a machine on that network.

## **Resource Groups and Network Infrastructure**

This [Resource group and network infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-deploy-plan#resource-group-and-network-infrastructure) article describes that a resource group needs to be created for the Avere vFXT, but you can use existing VNets and subnets.

## **IP Address requirements**

Avere vFXT clusters require a number of IP addresses. [IP address requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-deploy-plan#ip-address-requirements) describes the different types of IP address ranges required to deplay an Avere vFXT cluster.

## **Cluster Access**

This [Cluster access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-deploy-plan#cluster-access) describes how to access the vFXT cluster.

## **DNS Configuration**

The Avere vFXT depends on round-robin DNS to provide load-balanced DNS access to clients. [Avere cluster DNS Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/avere-vfxt/avere-vfxt-configure-dns) describes how to set this up.

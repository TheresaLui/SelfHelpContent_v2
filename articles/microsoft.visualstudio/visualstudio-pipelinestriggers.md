   -    [GitHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github#failing-triggers)
   -    [GitHub Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github-enterprise#failing-triggers)
   -    [BitBucket Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/bitbucket#failing-triggers)
   -    [BitBucket server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/on-premises-bitbucket#failing-triggers)
   -    [TFVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/tfvc#ci-triggers)
   -    [Subversion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/subversion#failing-triggers)	

* I am using scheduled triggers in my YAML pipeline, and the pipeline is not being triggered on schedule

  - Read the suggestions in [scheduled triggers FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers#faq).

* I am using pipeline resources in my YAML pipeline, and the pipeline is not being triggered

* I have a classic build or release pipeline, and triggers do not work
  - [Classic release pipeline triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/triggers)
  - [Build completion triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/pipeline-triggers?tabs=classic) in classic build pipelines

* My pipeline is triggered, but it is stuck waiting
  Go back and change the problem type as follows:

    - Problem type: **Pipelines - Configuring pipelines**

* My pipeline is triggered, but fails in `checkout` or `get sources` step
  Go back and change the problem type as follows:
  
    - Problem type: **Pipelines - Building and testing your application**
    - Problem subtype: **Getting source code from repository into pipeline**

* I have other issues with integrating my pipeline with Azure Repos, GitHub, BitBucket, or Subversion.

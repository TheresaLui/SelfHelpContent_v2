# Azure Pipelines Marketplace Extensions

## **Recommended Steps**

* I have a problem with using **SonarQube** in my pipeline

  - SonarQube integration into a pipeline is through [SonarQube extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarqube) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. If you have an issue with how SonarQube extension works, seek support on that Marketplace page. The Azure DevOps support team is unable to support Marketplace extensions.
  - If you use Microsoft-hosted agents and if your SonarQube server is behind a firewall, [learn how to configure your firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#networking)

* I have a problem with using the **Terraform** extension in my pipeline

  - Terraform integration into a pipeline is through [Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. If you have an issue with how Terraform extension works, seek support on that Marketplace page. Terraform issues should be reported on this [GitHub respository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-extensions/issues). The Azure DevOps support team is unable to support Marketplace extensions.

# Azure Pipelines Marketplace Extensions

## **Recommended Steps**

Are you facing one of these common problems?

* I have a problem with using **SonarQube** in my pipeline

  - SonarQube integration into a pipeline is through [SonarQube extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarqube) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. If you have an issue with how SonarQube extension works, then your best bet is to seek support on that Marketplace page. The Azure DevOps support team is unable to support Marketplace extensions.
  - If you use Microsoft-hosted agents and if your SonarQube server is behind a firewall, see [this topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#networking) for how to configure your firewall

* I have a problem with using **Terraform** extension in my pipeline

  - Terraform integration into a pipeline is through [Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. If you have an issue with how Terraform extension works, then your best bet is to seek support on that Marketplace page. Terraform issues should be reported on this [GitHub respository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-extensions/issues). The Azure DevOps support team is unable to support Marketplace extensions.

* I have a problem with using an extension in my pipeline

  - The Azure DevOps support team is unable to support Marketplace extensions. Your best bet is to locate the extension you are using on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Pipelines&sortBy=Installs). On that page, you should be able to find a link to get support. This is usually a GitHub repository in which you can create an issue or a link to get community support.

# Azure Artifacts

Resolve common issues around artifacts with the following solutions.

## **Recommended Steps**

* I am unable to upload additional packages and get the error: "Artifact cannot be uploaded because max quantity has been exceeded or the payment instrument is invalid"

  - Go to the **Billing** section under **Organization Settings** and make sure that your tier is set to **No limit, pay as you go**. After you make this change, the new setting can take approximately 1 hour to take effect.

* How can I see which packages are stored and where?

  - Go to the **Artifacts and Storage** section under **Organization Settings**. Here, you can see a breakdown of your packages within feeds and projects. More information can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azuredevops-artifacts-storage-exploration).

* I used to be on usage tiers, and am no longer on that!

  - See [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-artifacts-billing-changes-coming-october-2020/) for changes to Artifacts billing

# Common Permissions-Related Issues

Use this topic to resolve common permissions-related issues.

## **Recommended Steps** 

**Why can't users access some features?**

* They may need a different [access level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#supported-access-levels) assigned. This is in addition to permissions granted through security groups. For example, [Stakeholder](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#stakeholder-access) access level provides partial support to select features, allowing users to view and modify work items, but not to use all features.

**How do I find my admin?**

* See [Find your administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/lookup-organization-owner-admin?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page).

**I added a user to my project. Why can't they see the project?**

* To view a [project](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/permissions?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page#project-level-groups), users must have the [**view project level information** permission set to **allow**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fsecurity-access-billing%2Ftoc.json&amp;bc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fsecurity-access-billing%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&amp;view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page).

**I accidentally removed my permissions, and am unable to grant them again. What should I do?**

* The only way to resolve this scenario is to [find your project/org admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/lookup-organization-owner-admin?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page) and ask them to grant the permission again.

**How do I remove users from Azure DevOps?**

* See [How to remove users from Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/delete-organization-users?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=preview-page).

**Why can't I create an organization?**

* Contact your administrator to determine if your organization is using [the Azure AD tenant policy to restrict new org creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/azure-ad-tenant-policy-restrict-org-creation?view=azure-devops).

**Why can't guest users search for Azure Active Directory users?**

* By default, [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-why-are-no-identities-found-when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization).

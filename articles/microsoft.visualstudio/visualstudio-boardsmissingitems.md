# Missing or Incorrect Work Items

## **Recommended Steps**

Are you facing one of these common problems?

* Why can't I find a work item on the backlog or board?

  - Make sure the work item is assigned to area path that corresponds to the teams backlog. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations?view=azure-devops)

  - Ensure you are looking at the [correct backlog level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-overview?view=azure-devops#product-and-portfolio-backlogs)

  - You may not have the backlog level enabled for your team. Try setting your team's [preferences for backlog levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels)

  - Try changing your settings so [Bugs are managed with requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog?view=azure-devops)

  - If you are have a large team, you may have reached the limit of 10,000 items that can be displayed on the backlog. See [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/object-limits?view=azure-devops#backlogs-boards-and-teams) for details

  - If you are missing Bugs on your board, make sure you are [showing bugs on the backlogs and boards](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fboards%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fboards%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops)

  - Check the recycle bin to see of the work item was deleted. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/remove-delete-work-items?view=azure-devops)

  - Try creating a [query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/queries/query-index-quick-ref?view=azure-devops) to search for work items by id or title

- The board or backlog I am seeing is not for my team. How to I find my Teams backlog or board?
  - Use the board and backlog picker to find the right board or backlog for your team. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-quickstart?view=azure-devops#open-your-kanban-board-from-the-web-portal)

# Azure pipelines issues while making use of Azure virtual machines or scale sets tasks

Resolve common issues with VMs and scale sets tasks using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**


* **My application successfully starts on VM or VMSS using Azure pipelines. However, the application process is terminated in the *Finalize Job* of the pipeline run.**
	
    All processes started by Azure pipelines are terminated and cleaned up in the **Finalize Job**. If you don't want the processes to be closed, please create and set a variable **Process.clean=false**. The next time you create a new release, you'll need to close the previous application before deploying a new one.

* **I want to deploy the application on virtual machine scale set.**

    [Follow these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-deploy-app#:~:text=To%20run%20applications%20on%20virtual,scripts%20on%20existing%20VM%20instances)

* **My Build pipeline is failing with PowerShell task on the remote machine**

    Ensure that WinRM is configured and associated on the remote machine to execute the PowerShell task. [Refer to this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/winrm).

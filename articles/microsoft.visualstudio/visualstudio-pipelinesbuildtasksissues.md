# Azure Pipelines issues when using various build tasks

## **Recommended Steps**

Are you facing one of these common problems?

* I encounter an error **NU1101: Unable to find package WindowsAzure.Storage. No packages exist with this id in source(s): Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages** in the DotNet build task

	Add a **dotnet restore** step before the build step which will complete the restore before the build and add the **--no-restore** argument to the build step.

* **.NET Core** task is failing in my pipelines

	Ensure that you are using the right version of the task and that the packages for the project are compatible with the target Netcore framework that makes use of latest MSBuild.

* An error occurs while running **dotnet run extract**

	Make sure you are using a proper format while running 'dotnet run extract'.

* I need guidance on using the **.NetCore** build tasks in my Azure Pipelines

	You can refer to [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/dotnet-core?view=azure-devops)

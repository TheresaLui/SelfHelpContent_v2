# Azure DevOps Services Change Org Owner

Most users can resolve issues concerning changing the organization owner by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

Most change organization owner requests fall into the following categories:

###  I need to change the owner of my organization and either the current organization owner or a project collection administrator is still active. 
    
Prerequisites:
  - Ensure that you are either a project collection [administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-user-and-permissions-management?view=azure-devops#q-how-do-i-find-a-project-collection-administrator) or the organization [owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-user-and-permissions-management?view=azure-devops#q-how-do-i-find-the-organization-owner) 
  - Ensure that the account that you want to make the organization owner has signed in to your organization, created a profile, and agreed to the Terms of Services
  - Ensure that the account has accessed the organization at least once after creating an initial profile

If this is your issue and you meet the above prerequisites, see [Changing organization owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-organization-ownership?view=azure-devops#change-organization-owner).
	
###  I need to change the owner of my organization and the organization owner and project collection administrator(s) are no longer active.

Prerequisites: 
  - Your Azure DevOps Services organization must be connected to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

If this is your issue and you meet the above prerequisites, see [How to transfer ownership to another user](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/resolve-orphaned-organization?view=azure-devops).

###  I need to change the owner of my organization. It is not connected to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and neither the current organization owner or project collection administrator(s) are still active.
    
If this is your issue or your issue is not listed, continue to create a support request.

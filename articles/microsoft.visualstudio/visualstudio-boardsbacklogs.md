# Azure Boards backlog issues

## **Recommended Steps**

Are you facing one of these common problems?

* Why can't I find a work item on the backlog?

  - Make sure the work item is assigned to area path that corresponds to the teams backlog. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations?view=azure-devops)

  - Ensure you are looking at the correct backlog level. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-overview?view=azure-devops#product-and-portfolio-backlogs)

  - You may not have the backlog level enabled for your team. Try setting your team's [preferences for backlog levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels)

  - Try changing your settings so Bugs are managed with requirements. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog?view=azure-devops)

  - If you are have a large team, you may have reached the limit of 10,000 items that can be displayed on the backlog. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/object-limits?view=azure-devops#backlogs-boards-and-teams)

* Why are Features or Epics missing from the backlog?

  - Ensure you are looking at the correct backlog level (Epics, Features, Stories). [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-overview?view=azure-devops#product-and-portfolio-kanban-boards)

  - Try showing parents to [expand the tree hierarchy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/organize-backlog?view=azure-devops)

  - Check the filter to make sure it is not excluding the work item type. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/filter-backlogs?view=azure-devops)

* I don't see any work items that are in progress

  - Try configuring your backlog view to show work In Progress. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-overview?view=azure-devops#in-progress-items-and-work-listed-on-the-backlog)

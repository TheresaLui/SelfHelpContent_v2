# Azure Pipelines Timeout Issues

## **Recommended Steps**

Following are steps to resolve specific issues concerning timeouts in Azure Pipelines.

* I purchased additional parallel jobs. However, my pipelines still time out after 60 minutes.

  - By purchasing Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs, you can increase your timeouts up to 6 hours per job. The default timeout is still 60 minutes. 
  - To increase the timeout in YAML pipelines, specify the [`timeoutInMinutes`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#timeouts) property in the YAML file.
  - To increase the timeout in classic pipelines, specify the value of timeout in the [Options tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic#timeouts).

* I have pipelines that run for several hours. How do I configure Azure Pipelines to run these pipelines?

  - The maximum duration of each job in a pipeline is 6 hours on Microsoft-hosted agents if you build open-source or public projects. It is also 6 hours if you purchased Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs. Otherwise, it is 60 minutes. To go from 60 minutes to 6 hours, you need to [purchase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs?view=azure-devops) Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs.
  - There is no way to run jobs longer than 6 hours on Microsoft-hosted agents.
  - You can use self-hosted agents to run longer jobs. There are no limits on how long jobs can run on self-hosted agents.
  - You can split your pipeline into multiple jobs, each of which take less than 6 hours, and still run the pipeline on Microsoft-hosted agents.

* What are all the places where I can configure timeouts for my build or YAML pipelines?

  - You can configure timeout for each [step](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#controloptions) and for each [job](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#timeouts) in a pipeline.
  - The maximum duration for each job depends on whether you use self-hosted agents (no limits) or [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs?view=azure-devops). In the case of the latter, it also depends on whether you use free tier for private projects (60 minute limit) or paid tier/public projects (6 hours).

* My pipeline waits a long time for an agent to be allocated.
  - Go back and change the problem type as follows:
Problem type: **Pipelines - Configuring pipelines**
Problem subtype: **My pipelines are stuck waiting in a queue**
  
* I get the error message, "We stopped hearing from agent Azure Pipelines 2. Verify the agent machine is running and has a healthy network connection."
  - Go back and change the problem type as follows:
Problem type: **Pipelines - Configuring pipelines**
Problem subtype: **Microsoft-hosted agents - disk space, IP address range, and so on**

* I deployed a self-hosted build agent as limit exceeded beyond the free minutes specified. However, all my builds still fail.

  - The pipeline would be pointing to an Azure Pipeline agent. Change the agent pool to the self-hosted pool and it will work.

* How do I increase build timeout?

   - Change the **jobTimeoutInminutes** value by referring to this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#timeouts)

* My build pipeline is timing out even after setting the **Build timeout in minutes** to 0.

  - This is because the **jobTimeoutInMinutes** is set to 60 for the pipeline. Change the timeout in the **Agent Job settings** to 0.

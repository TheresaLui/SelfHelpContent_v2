# Azure pipelines issues while making use of Azure Service Connections

## **Recommended Steps**

Here are solutions to many common Azure pipeline issues when making Azure Service connections.

* **Why are service endpoints automatically created when running YAML pipelines?**
The service endpoints are created automatically because of AAD subscription auth specified in the pipelines. AAD auth in Pipelines is used for creating ARM service connection or AKS service connection. [Refer this document for more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-using-automated-security).

* **Unable to delete the service connections**
This situation is often encountered when you are trying to migrate to a new tenant. In such scenarios, go to the old tenant and delete the app registrations present and delete the [service connection via API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/devops/serviceendpoint/endpoints/delete?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0).

* **Operation failed to create Service connection**
When creating the service connection, [make sure that it is verified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#create-a-service-connection)

* **Error: "Service Connection is unable to access the pipeline"**
Make sure that you're using the correct service connection and that the tasks used in the pipeline can access the credentials defined in the secrets.  [Learn how to use a service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#use-a-service-connection).

* **Failed to authorize the service connection resource for pipeline**
Make sure that the appropriate service connection is selected in the pipeline and has the necessary [pipeline permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#pipeline-permissions) are granted to access this service connection.

* **Service connection name cannot be read from variable in pipeline**
By design, Azure DevOps does not allow Service Connection names to be used as pipeline variables. [Refer this document for more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#use-a-service-connection).

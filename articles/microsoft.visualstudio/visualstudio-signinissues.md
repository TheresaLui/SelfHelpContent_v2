# Common causes of sign-in issues

## **Recommended Steps**

Troubleshoot connectivity<br>

As a first step in resolving any connectivity issues with Azure DevOps, complete the following steps:
1. Sign out of your browser. To do so, select the Visual Studio sign out link.
2. Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del.
3. Open Internet Explorer and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies.
4. Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE.
5. Use a private browser session to retry the connection. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection, and then re add it.<br>

# Common causes of sign-in issues 

## **Recommended Steps** 

### Troubleshooting Connectivity

As a first step in resolving any connectivity issues with Azure DevOps, complete the following steps: 

1. Sign out of your browser. To do so, select the Visual Studio sign out link. 
2. Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del. 
3. Open Internet Explorer and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies. 
4. Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE
5. Use a private browser session to retry the connection. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it.<br>

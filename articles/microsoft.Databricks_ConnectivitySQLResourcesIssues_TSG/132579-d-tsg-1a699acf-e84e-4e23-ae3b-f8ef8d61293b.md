# Could not connect to MySQL Postgres or JDBC  connection to Database times out 

### Symptom

Could not connect to MySQL, Postgress, or JDBC - connection to Database times out getting errors like:

`OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection timed out`

`Database 'xxx' on server '[REDACTED].database.windows.net' is not currently available. Please retry the connection later`

`The TCP/IP connection to the host [REDACTED].worker.database.windows.net, port 11042 has failed. Error: 'connect timed out. Verify the connection properties. Make sure that an instance of SQL Server is running on the host and accepting TCP/IP connections at the port. Make sure that TCP connections to the port are not blocked by a firewall.'`

### Troubleshooting

1. Are you able to nslookup database with FQDN mysql.database.windows.com or postgress server123.com from notebook?

      Postgress example:

		%sh  telnet testprogress.postgres.database.azure.com 5432 
		Trying 191.238.6.43... 
		Connected to cr1.eastus1-a.control.database.windows.net. Escape character is '^]'.

      MySQL example:

		 %sh telnet consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306 
		 Trying 104.42.238.205... 
		 Connected to cr2.westus1-a.control.database.windows.net. Escape character is '^]'

2. Are you able to tracert to mysql.database.windows.com or postgress server123.comfrom notebook?

3. Is it specific to a cluster or all clusters?

4. Is Databricks VNet whitelisted in Azure Datbase firewall?

5. Is there a SQL endpoint or route available to database?


### Solution

- If nslookup fails, they may be using a custom DNS. Try to change a DNS that works and point to ARR. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances. 
- If traceroute fails, add a route with adding SQL endpoint or private endpoint, and attach to Azure Databricks VNet.
- If the firewall does not have Databricks VNet whitelisted, whitelist it and try.
- If traffic is routed through firewall or proxy. Add a rule to allow traffic to mysql.database.windows.com or postgress server123.com. 

### Next Steps

If issue persists, ask SME on AVA and involve Azure Network or SQL teams if needed.

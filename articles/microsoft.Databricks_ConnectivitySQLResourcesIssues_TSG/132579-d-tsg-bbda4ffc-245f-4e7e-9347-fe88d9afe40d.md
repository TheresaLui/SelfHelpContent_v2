# Simple SQL commands getting timed out because of the metastore issue

### Symptom

Simple SQL commands getting timed out because of the metastore issue. The behavior is consistent failure once the issue is hit and is resovled with the cluster restart.

`20/03/19 07:11:24 ERROR RetryingHMSHandler: Retrying HMSHandler after 2000 ms (attempt 1 of 1) with error: javax.jdo.JDODataStoreException: (conn=61098) Could not send query: Connection timed out (Read failed)  at org.datanucleus.api.jdo.NucleusJDOHelper.getJDOExceptionForNucleusException(NucleusJDOHelper.java:451) `


### Troubleshooting

- Do nc test to verify the metastore host is reachable from the customer VNet. Run similar command from a notebook in the customer environment:

		%sh nc -zv consolidated-centralus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306

		%sh for i in {1..10} ; do nc -zv consolidated-westus-prod-metastore.mysql.database.azure.com 3306
		done

- Check if you can connect to Metastore backend using simple JDBC snippet (use executeQuery scala snippet) or SQL client tools (mysql client for example) from the notebook. 

- Verify that issue is not consistent across all clusters in the workspace.


### Solution

- If you see metastore is not reachable with nc test or sample jdbc/mysql client test,  check customer network settings and reach out to Azure Networking/Database team if needed.

- If you see JDBC/mysql client test working, it could be related to BoneCP connection pooling used with Hive metastore client. If the customer has not been already configured with HIkariCP, help setting up HikariCP for Hive metastore client and monitor the environment.

# Configure Client migration for Office

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,<br><br><br>Please make sure the client side configuration is completed correctly as per [Migrate AD RMS-Azure Information Protection - Phase 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/migrate-from-ad-rms-phase3) <br>If you are using DNS based redirection, remember that this will work only for O365 version of the Office clients. MSI Versions of the office doesnâ€™t use DNS based redirection. For such clients make sure to run the Client Migration scripts as per the document.<br>Also open the registry on the client machine and make sure the values are added properly as defined in the migration scripts.<br><br>Best regards,

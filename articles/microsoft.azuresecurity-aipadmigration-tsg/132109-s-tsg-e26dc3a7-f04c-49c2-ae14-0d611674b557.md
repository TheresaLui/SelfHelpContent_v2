# Configure DNS based redirection

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,<br><br>When an old AD RMS protected email is opened from OWA after migrating to AIP, the Exchange Online will try to reach the AD RMS url to decrypt the message. So it is important to add the DNS based redirection for the AD RMS url after the migration to AIP. Old AD RMS protected mails will fail to open from OWA if the DNS based redirection is not configured.<br><br>Please configure DNS based redirection as per:[  Migrate AD RMS-Azure Information Protection - Phase 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/migrate-from-ad-rms-phase3#client-reconfiguration-by-using-dns-redirection)<br><br>Best Regards,

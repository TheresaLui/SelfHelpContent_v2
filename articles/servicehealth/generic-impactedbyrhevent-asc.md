# Your Azure resource was impacted by a resource health event
At <!--$startTime-->startTime<!--/$startTime--> UTC, the Azure monitoring system received the following information regarding your resource <!--$ResourceName-->ResourceName<!--/$ResourceName-->:

<!--$Summary-->Summary<!--/$Summary-->

<!--$DetailedStatus-->DetailedStatus<!--/$DetailedStatus-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Use Azure Resource Health**: [view detailed information](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade/resourceHealth) about the current and past health status of your Azure resource, <!--$ResourceName-->ResourceName<!--/$ResourceName-->, as well as recommended actions that you can take for specific availability issues.

* **Create a Resource Health alert**: the alert will notify you and your team the next time there is an issue with your Azure services that affects you. [Configure alerts for resource health events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-arm-template-guide).

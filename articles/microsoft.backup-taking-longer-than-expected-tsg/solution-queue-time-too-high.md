# Queue time is high

<!--issueDescription-->

There might be a lag between taking the snapshot and copying it to vault.<br>
<br>
At peak times, it can take up to eight hours for backups to be processed. The backup time for a VM will be less than 24 hours for the daily backup.<br>
<br>
Follow best practices: <br>
<br>
Modify the default schedule times that are set in a policy. For example, if the default time in the policy is 12:00 AM, increment the timing by several minutes so that resources are optimally used.<br>

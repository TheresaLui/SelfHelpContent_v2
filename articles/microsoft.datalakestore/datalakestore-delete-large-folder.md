# ADLS Gen1 - delete large folder
 

Recursive deletes of large subfolders in an ADLS Gen1 account may time out when the user performing the deletes is not a superuser. Recursive deletes require recursive enumeration of subfolders to perform ACL checks to ensure that the user has the required permissions to delete all files under the target folder.  
<br>

## **Recommended steps**


1. Issue the recursive delete as a superuser. This will skip the recursive enumeration required for ACL checks.<br>

2. If 1) is not possible, try to delete smaller sub-folders individually before deleting the parent folder.<br>

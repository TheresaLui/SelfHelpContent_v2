# How do I update the gateway service?

## **Recommended steps**

* You can configure gateway updates to occur automatically or manually in the [Gateway update blade](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_RSMT.GatewayUpdateBlade). If “Automatic” is selected, the update will be installed within 30 minutes after the update has become available. If “Manual” is selected, you will need to choose “Schedule now” to schedule a one-time update to occur within the next 30 minutes.
* If an immediate update is necessary, you can do so by restarting the gateway service. Log on to the gateway machine, run “services.msc” to launch the Services MMC snap-in. Restart the "ServerManagementToolsGateway" service and the update will occur within a few minutes.

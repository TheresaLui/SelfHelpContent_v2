# Bugs with name resolution on ATM profiles

The resolved IP doesn?t belong to any specific P2S GW?s VIP between all the P2S GWs of the vWAN, or customer is using ?HUB user VPN configuration? and the resolved IP is the one of an unexpected HUB?s GW.

These would be both bugs.

Please engage TA for validating possible alternatives.

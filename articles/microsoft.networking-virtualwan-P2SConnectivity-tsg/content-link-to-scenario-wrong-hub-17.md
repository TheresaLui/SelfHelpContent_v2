# Link to scenario wrong HUB

If the client is experiencing redirection to an unexpected HUB, this is likely to be an issue with the client's LDNS mapping.

Please restart troubleshooter and select scenario *Client is getting redirected to incorrect HUB* first, since we need to fix client's redirection to wrong HUB before debugging pure P2S connectivity.

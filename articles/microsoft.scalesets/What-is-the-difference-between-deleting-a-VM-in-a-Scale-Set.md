# What is the difference between deleting a VM in a Scale Set, vs. deallocating the VM? When should I choose one over the other?

The main difference is that deallocate doesnâ€™t delete the VHDs, so there are storage costs associated with stop deallocate. Reasons you might use one over the other include:
- You want to stop paying Compute but keep the disk state of the VMs.
- You want to start a set of VMs faster than scaling out a scale set.
  - related to this scenario, you created your own autoscale engine and want faster end to end scale.
  - You have a scale set that is unevenly distributed across FD/UDs (due to selectively deleting VMs or due to VMs being deleted after overprovisioning). Stop deallocate followed by start on the scale set will evenly distribute the VMs across FD/UDs.

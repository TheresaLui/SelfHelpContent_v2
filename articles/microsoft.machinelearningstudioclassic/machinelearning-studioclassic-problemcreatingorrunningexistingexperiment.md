# Problem creating or running existing experiment

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If module errors occur, please check [module reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/), or [module error code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/errors/machine-learning-module-error-codes).
    - Specifically for error like "The input is not a valid Base-64 string as it contains a non-base 64 character, more than two padding characters, or an illegal character among the padding characters.", please make sure there is no white spaces in your input value.
1. Studio (classic) has compute memory sku limitation. Actually the compute is a shared host pool where one customer can use 8 cores, 56GB at most for training. Memory cost could also be affected by different machine learning algorithms and parameter settings. For more powerful compute resource, please consider using [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer).

## **Recommended Documents**
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) is a collaborative, drag-and-drop tool you can use to build, test, and deploy predictive analytics solutions on your data. Customers currently using or evaluating Machine Learning Studio (classic) are encouraged to try [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer), which provides drag and drop ML modules plus scalability, version control, and enterprise security.

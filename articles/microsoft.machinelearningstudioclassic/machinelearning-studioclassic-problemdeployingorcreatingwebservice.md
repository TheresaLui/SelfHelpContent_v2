# Problem deploying or creating web service

## **Recommended Steps**

For errors like "Error Message: Web Service deployment failed. This account does not have sufficient access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace. In order to deploy a Web Service to Azure, the same account must be invited to the Workspace and be given access to the Azure subscription that contains the Workspace.", the root cause is authentication, **Deploy Web Service [Classic]** is recommended. When userâ€™s in multiple tenants and one or more tenants required MFA (multi-factor authentication), this error might occur. There are two ways user could have a try:

    - Create a new account in your target tenant (where your workspace belongs to). 
    - Or one existing account which only exists in the target tenant, invite this account to your studio workspace and assign proper role to it in your subscription.

Then try to login to your studio workspace use this account and deploy webservice to see if it works.

# Can't access machine learning studio (classic) portal

## **Recommended Steps**

The permission control of Studio (classic) workspace is different from Azure. If user is not invited to the workspace, even he can see the workspace resource from Azure portal, he is still not able to see the workspace from Studio (classic) portal. This means, although the customer see the workspace listed under the subscription, but since he doesn't have the permission to the workspace, he cannot access from Studio (classic) portal.

Make sure that you are invited to a Studio (classic) workspace, then you can access to it.

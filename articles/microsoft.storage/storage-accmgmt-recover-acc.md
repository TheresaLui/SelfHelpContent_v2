# Recover deleted storage account

## **Recommended Steps**

You can initiate the recovery of a storage account here: [Recover a deleted storage account](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Storage.RecoverStorageAccountBlade.subscriptionId.$subscriptionId). Please note that certain conditions need to be met for a storage account to be recoverable. The conditions that are necessary for a storage account or storage account data to be recoverable are laid out below.

Storage resource recovery is only possible if **a new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since** and if the following conditions are true.

**Resource group** recovery:

We can only attempt to recover deleted storage accounts within the resource group that was deleted in the last 14 days. All other resources will need to be manually rebuild.

**Storage account** recovery:

- The storage account was deleted in the last 14 days

**Container** recovery:

1. The container was deleted in the last 14 days<br>
2. Storage account replication is configured as one of the following (we need the geo-replicated data for recovery):

   * [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs)
   * [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)
   * [Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-gzrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json)

**Blob and disk** recovery:

1. This is a critical production data
2. Blob was deleted in the last:<br>

	* 7 days for standard storage<br>
	* 3 days for premium storage<br>

# Recover deleted storage account

## **Recommended Steps**

Storage account recovery is only possible if both the following conditions are true:

1. Storage account was deleted in the last 14 days
2. A new storage account with the same name has not been created since

**Note:** Garbage collection could occur on our system at any time, so we cannot guarantee successful recovery.

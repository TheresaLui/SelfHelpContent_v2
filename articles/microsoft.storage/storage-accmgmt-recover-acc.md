# Recover deleted storage data

### **Storage Account Recovery**

You can initiate the recovery of your storage account directly from the portal. <br />

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-recover?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json) and click on the button below to recover your deleted storage account.

<a href="data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Storage.RecoverStorageAccountBlade.subscriptionId.$subscriptionId"><button type="button" style="background-color:#1E90FF;color:white;width:240px; height:40px;"><b> Initiate Storage Account Recovery </b> </button></a>

Note: If you are trying to recover a storage account in a deleted resource group, re-create the resource group first. Recovery will fail if the resource group is not re-created.

### **Storage Data Recovery Guidelines**

Container, Blob and Disk Recovery

1. If soft-delete is enabled for your container/blob, you can undelete your container/blob if you are still in your retention period. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) for instructions.
2. If soft-delete is not enabled, your container/blob/disk can only be recovered if the following conditions are true:

Container recovery

1. The container was deleted in the last 14 days<br>
2. Storage account replication is configured as [GRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs), [RA-GRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) or [GZRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-gzrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) (We need the geo-replicated data for recovery)
3. A new storage object with the same name has not been re-created since deletion.

Blob and disk recovery

1. This is a critical production data
2. Blob was deleted in the last:<br>
	* 7 days for standard storage<br>
	* 3 days for premium storage<br>
3. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion. 

Note: It may not be possible to recover deleted data even if above conditions are true. As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten.Follow our [best practices for protecting your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#best-practices-for-protecting-your-data) to ensure that accidentally deleted content can be recovered in the future.

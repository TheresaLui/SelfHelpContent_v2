# Recover deleted Storage Account

## **Recommended steps**
Storage Account recovery is only possible under the following conditions. Please check if:

1. Account was deleted in the last 14 days<br> 
2. A new Account with the same name has not been created since<br> 

**Note:** Garbage collection could occur on our system at any time, so we cannot guarantee successful recovery.

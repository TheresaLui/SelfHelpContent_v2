# Recover deleted storage account

## **Storage Account Recovery**

You can initiate the recovery of your storage account directly from the portal. Click on the link below to recover your storage account: <br />

## [**Recover a deleted storage account**](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Storage.RecoverStorageAccountBlade.subscriptionId.$subscriptionId) <br />

Please note that certain conditions need to be met for a storage account to be recoverable:

1. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion.
2. The storage account was deleted in the last 14 days.
3. It is not a classic storage account.

## **Container**, **Blob** and **Disk** Recovery

### **Soft-Delete**:

1. Check if you have soft-delete enabled for your container/blob.
2. If enabled, you can undelete your container/blob if you are still in your retention period. 

For more information on how to recover a container or a bob using soft-delete, [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).

3. If soft-delete is not enabled, **your container/blob/disk can only be recovered if the following conditions are true**:

### **Container** recovery:

1. The container was deleted in the last 14 days<br>
2. Storage account replication is configured as one of the following (we need the geo-replicated data for recovery):

   * [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs)
   * [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)
   * [Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-gzrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json)
3. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion.

### **Blob and disk** recovery:

1. This is a critical production data
2. Blob was deleted in the last:<br>

	* 7 days for standard storage<br>
	* 3 days for premium storage<br>
3. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion. 


### **Resource group** recovery:

**We cannot recover a deleted resource group.** We can only attempt to recover deleted storage accounts within the resource group that was deleted in the last 14 days. All other resources will need to be manually rebuilt.
<br />
<br />
**Note:** It may **not** be possible to recover deleted data even if above conditions are true. As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten.<br>

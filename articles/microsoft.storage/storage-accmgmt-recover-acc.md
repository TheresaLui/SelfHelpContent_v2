# Recover deleted storage account

## **Recommended Steps**

Storage account recovery is only possible if both the following conditions are true:

1. Storage account was deleted in the last 14 days
2. A new storage account with the same name has not been created since

**Note:** As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten. This storage account and all its content may not be recoverable by Azure even when all conditions above are true.<br>

Follow our [best practices for protecting your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#best-practices-for-protecting-your-data) to ensure that accidentally deleted content can be recovered in the future.

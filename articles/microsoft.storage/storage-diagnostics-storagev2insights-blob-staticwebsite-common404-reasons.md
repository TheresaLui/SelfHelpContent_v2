# Why am I getting 404 from Static Website?

<!--issueDescription-->
Please see the Recommended Steps to resolve HTTP 404 errors with Static Website.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Some of the common causes of getting an HTTP 404 error are as below:

- Use a web endpoint such as *https://myaccount.z5.web.core.windows.net/index.html* instead of a blob endpoint like *https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/$web/index.html*. You can find the actual endpoint on the Azure portal.
- For Static Website file names along with extensions are case sensitive even though served over HTTP, therefore index.html != Index.html
- CDN endpoint might take time to provision. Please wait 90 mins after you provisioned new CDN for the propagation to happen.

Most users are able to resolve their AD authentication over SMB issue using the steps below. These solutions are written by Azure engineers, and will solve most common issues.

## **Recommended Steps**    
Ensure that the following steps are completed to enable AD Authentication feature on your storage account:
1.	Have you ran through the [prerequisites to enable AD authentication over SMB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#prerequisites)?
2.	Is the virtual machine you used to mount Azure Files using AD credentials domain joined to AD?
3.	Is your storage account deployed to [an region where AD Authentication is available](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#regional-availability)?
4.	Have you [registered your storage account against your AD environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#enable-ad-authentication-for-your-account)? 
5.	Have you [granted share level permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#assign-access-permissions-to-an-identity) to the target user through RBAC?
6.	Have you [granted file/directory level permissions (NTFS ACLs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable#configure-ntfs-permissions-over-smb) to the target user through file explorers or icacls?

# Replication type RA-GRS is unsupported on Azure Files

<!--issueDescription-->
Azure Files is supported only on locally redundant storage (LRS), zone redundant storage (ZRS), and geo-redundant storage (GRS) accounts. We plan to support read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) storage in the future, but we don't have a timeline to share.

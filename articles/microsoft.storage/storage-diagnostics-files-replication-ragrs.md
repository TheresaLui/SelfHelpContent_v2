# Troubleshoot Azure Files Share mounting errors

<!--issueDescription-->
Currently, Azure Files supports locally redundant storage (LRS), zone redundant storage (ZRS), and geo-redundant storage (GRS). It is possible to use read-access geo-redundant (RA-GRS) with Azure Files, but it is not possible to read from secondary. Read from secondardy will be available in the future, but we don't have timelines to share at this time.

# High client latency detected

<!--issueDescription-->

High client latency was observed for storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** between time **<!--$IssueStartTime-->[IssueStartTime]<!--/$IssueStartTime-->** and **<!--$IssueEndTime-->[IssueEndTime]<!--/$IssueEndTime-->**, additionally, high client latency was also observed for the most recent time between **<!--$CurrentIssueStartTime-->[CurrentIssueStartTime]<!--/$CurrentIssueStartTime-->** and **<!--$CurrentIssueEndTime-->[CurrentIssueEndTime]<!--/$CurrentIssueEndTime-->**. The high latency could originate from either slow public internet connections, slow corporate proxy servers, bad routes, slow application performance such as high CPU, or client's network configuration problems.

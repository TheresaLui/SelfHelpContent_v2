# Requests to storage account failed authorization due to insufficient ACL permission
<!--issueDescription-->
 Between **<!--$StartTime-->[StartTime]<!--/$StartTime-->** and **<!--$EndTime-->[EndTime]<!--/$EndTime-->**, we didn't find any requests that failed authorization due to an insufficient **Access Control List (ACL)** associated with the user (service principal). However, we found a recent occurrence of ACL failures around **<!--$CurrentTimestamp-->[CurrentTimestamp]<!--/$CurrentTimestamp-->**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

The following table shows details of the failed requests with the operation type `Get(Read)` or `Put/Post(Write)`, along with the folder or file path and user. For successful authorization, the user (service principal) should have the following ACLs:

- **For the folder path** - Provide **Execute**(**X**) and **Read**(**R**) permissions for the relevant folder and **Execute**(**X**) permission on all the parent folders till root.<br>
- **For the file path** - Provide **Read**(**R**) or **Write**(**W**) permission, depending on the operation on the file and **Execute**(**X**) permission on all the parent folders till root.

To learn more about ACLs, see [Manage Access control lists (ACLs) in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).

**Note:** There may be more client IPs for which requests are blocked, but that are not displayed here. For  the full list, see the **[storage analytics log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-analytics#about-storage-analytics-logging)**.

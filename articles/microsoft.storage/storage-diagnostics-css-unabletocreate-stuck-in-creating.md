# **Storage Account stuck in creating state**

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure identified that the Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** is stuck in creating state because another Storage Account with the same name was recently deleted and has not been garbage collected (GC) yet. 

Please file an ICM for Storage team to further investigate. <br>

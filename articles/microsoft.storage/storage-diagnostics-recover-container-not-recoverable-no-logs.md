# Unable to recover Blob Container
<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure sincerely apologizes that we are unable to recover deleted blob container(s).
<!--/issueDescription-->

### Blob container(s) does not exist
The following blob container(s) in storage account _**<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**_ are not recoverable because we cannot find deletion log for them between **<!--$LogSearchStartTime-->[LogSearchStartTime]<!--/$LogSearchStartTime-->** and **<!--$LogSearchEndTime-->[LogSearchEndTime]<!--/$LogSearchEndTime-->**. Any container(s) that was deleted at an earlier time are also not recoverable. As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten. These blob container(s) and all their contents were cleaned up after deletion and is no longer recoverable by Azure:<br>

### Active blob container(s) exist
The following blob container(s) already exist in storage account _**<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**_ which means that they were either not deleted or has been recreated with the same name. It is not possible for us to recover a container with the same name as another container in the  storage account:<br>

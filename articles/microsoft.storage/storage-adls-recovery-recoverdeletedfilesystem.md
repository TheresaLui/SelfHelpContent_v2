# Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage recover deleted file system

## **Recommended Steps**

File system recovery is only possible under the following conditions. Please check if:

1. File system was deleted in the last 14 days
2. Storage Account replication is configured as [Geo-redundant storage(GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs) or [Read-access-geo-redundant storage(RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)<br>
3. A new File system with the same name has not been created since

**Note:** Garbage collection could occur on our system at any time, so we cannot guarantee successful recovery.

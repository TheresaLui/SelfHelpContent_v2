### Storage Data Recovery Guidelines

**Container, Blob and Disk Recovery**

1. If soft-delete is enabled for your container/blob, you can undelete your container/blob if you are still in your retention period. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) for instructions.
2. If soft-delete is not enabled, your container/blob/disk can only be recovered if the following conditions are true:

**Container recovery**

1. The container was deleted in the last 14 days<br>
2. Storage account replication is configured as [GRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs), [RA-GRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) or [GZRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-gzrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) (We need the geo-replicated data for recovery):
3. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion.

**Blob and disk recovery**

1. This is a critical production data
2. Blob was deleted in the last:<br>
	* 7 days for standard storage<br>
	* 3 days for premium storage<br>
3. A new storage object with the same name has not be re-created since deletion. 

**Note**: It may not be possible to recover deleted data even if above conditions are true.

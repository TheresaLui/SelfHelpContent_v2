# Change to ZRS replication type

Changing redundancy type to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) involves moving the physical data from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a [qualified region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs#support-coverage-and-regional-availability). 

## **Recommended Steps**

You have two primary options for converting to ZRS:

- Manually copy or move data to a new ZRS account from an existing account. If you need the migration to complete by a certain date consider performing a manual migration. A manual migration provides more flexibility than a live migration. With a manual migration, you're in control of the timing.
- Request a live migration. If your application requires high availability, Microsoft also provides a live migration option. A live migration is an in-place migration with no downtime. During a live migration, you can use your storage account while your data is migrated between source and destination storage stamps. During the migration process, you have the same level of durability and availability SLA as you normally do. 


Consider the following before to submitting a request for live migration to ZRS:

- While Microsoft handles your request for live migration promptly, there's no guarantee as to when a live migration will complete. If you need your data migrated to ZRS by a certain date, then Microsoft recommends that you perform a manual migration instead. Generally, the more data you have in your account, the longer it takes to migrate that data.
- Changing replication type from ZRS to LRS/GRS/RA-GRS is currently not supported. You will need to create a new storage account and manually migrate the data.
- Blob and GPv1 accounts will automatically be upgraded to GPv2 once the migration is complete. Make sure you review the [differences between the account types including billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).
- You must [manually convert your RA-GRS account(s) to GRS or LRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#changing-replication-strategy) before requesting live migration to ZRS
- There are no ingress or egress costs associated with the live migration
- Empty LRS/GRS accounts won't be migrated. Please create a new ZRS account instead.
- You can only request a live migration within the same region - for example, an LRS account in East Asia cannot be converted to ZRS in US West 2 with live migration. You will need to perform the data migration manually.
- Live migration is only supported for Standard accounts. Premium accounts are not supported.
- You can only request a live migration in a [region where ZRS is supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs#support-coverage-and-regional-availability)
- Changing replication type from ZRS Classic to ZRS is currently not supported. Our team is working on adding support for this operation. Once available you will be able to change the replication type to ZRS much like you upgrade from GPv1 to GPv2 account type.

# Change to ZRS replication type

Changing redundancy type to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) involves moving the physical data from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a [qualified region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#zone-redundant-storage). 

## **Recommended Steps**

You have [two primary options](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration?tabs=portal#perform-a-manual-migration-to-zrs-gzrs-or-ra-gzrs) for converting to ZRS:

- Manual Migration : Manually copy or move data to a new ZRS account from an existing account. If you need the migration to complete by a certain date consider performing a manual migration.
- Live Migration : If your application requires high availability, Microsoft also provides a live migration option. A live migration is an in-place migration with no downtime. 


Consider the following before to submitting a request for live migration to ZRS:

- There are no ingress or egress costs associated with the live migration
- You must [manually convert your RA-GRS account(s) to GRS or LRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#changing-replication-strategy) before requesting live migration to ZRS


- You can only request a live migration in a [region where ZRS is supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#zone-redundant-storage)

- Costs associated to your account may vary. [Click here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/?OCID=AID2100131_SEM_44cd34dfe0551f34d5ac54d8cbed6754%3AG%3As&ef_id=44cd34dfe0551f34d5ac54d8cbed6754%3AG%3As&msclkid=44cd34dfe0551f34d5ac54d8cbed6754) to see the costs for different redundancy options. Additionally, Blob and GPv1 accounts will automatically be upgraded to GPv2 once the migration is complete. Make sure you review the [differences between the account types including billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview)

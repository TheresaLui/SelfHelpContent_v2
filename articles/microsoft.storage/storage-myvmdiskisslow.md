# My VM/Disk is slow

## **Recommended steps**
Try following steps to diagnose and mitigate VM performance issue.

1. **Do you know PerfInsights can help you analyze Guest VM issues?** Start here: [Download PerfInsights](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54915&fa43d42b-25b5-4a42-fe9b-1634f450f5ee=True).<br> To ensure a speedy resolution, you can also provide us the PerfInsights logs if you create a support case.
2. Review your application error logs, traces and metrics to find any bottlenecks causing performance issues.<br>
Restart Application and machine as a quick way to recover from one-time issues.
3. Review OS (Operating System) level metrics such as CPU, memory usage, IO and network to see if any resource has consistent high utilization.<br>
For example on Windows use Perfmon.
4. Use VM Diagnostics and Storage Diagnostics in Azure Portal to identify if any resource being overutilized or throttled.<br>
[Enable diagnostics, monitor, identify and remediate issues with Azure VMs and storage](http://aka.ms/azurevmperf)
5. Scale up the Virtual Machine to a different VM type or series for increased performance<br>
Click 'Size' in the Settings blade of the VM resource.
6. Consider using Premium Storage account if its an I/O intensive use-case.<br>

# Troubleshoot and resolve ADLS Gen2 Lifecycle Management issues

Most customers resolved their Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen 2) Lifecycle Management issue on their own, using the following information.

## **Recommended Documents**

### **Some Lifecycle Management features may not be supported for ADLS Gen 2 storage accounts**
[Blob storage features available in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-supported-blob-storage-features)

### **Reasons why Lifecycle Management may not have executed as expected**

- [New and updated policy can take 24 to 48 hours to execute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#faq). We recommend waiting up to 48 hours to see the first batch of data transitions.
- [Unsupported blob types or actions are ignored during policy execution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#sample-rule) 
    - [Page blobs are not supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#sample-rule) 
    - [Append blobs support tiering only](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#sample-rule) 
- [System containers, such as **$logs** (diagnostic logs), **$web** (static website), and **$blobchangefeed** are not supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#sample-rule). These containers will be ignored during policy execution.
- [Immutable blob policies, legal holds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutable-storage) [and Blob Leases will prevent blobs from being deleted](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/lease-blob)
- [You are not using a supported Storage account type](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#availability-and-pricing)

### **Common prefix match misunderstandings**

For successful execution of Lifecycle Management policies on the storage account, refer the following execution and rule criteria to make modifications.

1. Wildcard character - asterisk ( * ) - does not mean _'matches one or more occurrences of any character'_. The asterisk is a valid character in a blob name in Azure Storage. If you add an asterisk in a rule, it means match the blobs with an asterisk in the blob name.

2. Wildcard character - question mark (?) - does not mean _'match a single occurrence of any character'_. The question mark is a valid character in a blob name in Azure Storage. If you add a question mark in a rule, it means match the blobs with a question mark in the blob name.

3. prefixMatch - exclamation mark and equal sign (!=) - The prefixMatch rules only consider positive(=) logical comparison. Therefore negative(!=) logical comparison are ignored.

- [Policy Rule Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts#rule-filters)

### **Lifecycle Management doesn't execute when Storage Firewall is enabled without "Trusted Services" selected**

- [Configure firewall and virtual networks Exception](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#manage-exceptions)
- [Trusted Microsoft Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#trusted-microsoft-services)
- [Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security)

### **Last Access Time based policies (Preview)**
- [Last Access Time Tracking is only available in these limited Regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#move-data-based-on-last-accessed-date-preview)
- [Setup a Lifecycle Management policy based on Last Access Time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal#how-last-access-time-tracking-works)

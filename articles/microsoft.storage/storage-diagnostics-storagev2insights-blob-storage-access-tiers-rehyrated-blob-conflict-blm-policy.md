## **Recommended Steps**

You can take one of more of these steps to overcome the conflict and prevent the rehydrated blob getting transitioned back to archive access tier.

* Modify the Rule Filters or Actions in the Lifecycle Management Policy on the storage account.
* Disable the Lifecycle Management Policy on the storage account.
* Copy an archived blob to an online tier in another storage account or a different container in same storage account. Make sure the other container is not covered by the policy.

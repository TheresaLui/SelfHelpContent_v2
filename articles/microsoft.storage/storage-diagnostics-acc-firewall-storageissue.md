# Storage issues when Storage Firewalls is enabled

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that [Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security) is configured on the Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**. Some Storage services such as blob to blob copy and Disk Import/Export do not work when Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks is configured. Storage team is working to fix this issue. In the meantime, please [disable Firewalls and Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#change-the-default-network-access-rule) and retry the failed operation.

# Azure file share was throttled

<!--issueDescription-->
The File Open/Close API transactions in storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** are high in proportion to the overall set of File API transactions. Please validate if this pattern of high File Open/Close API transactions is applicable for your workload as this could be be potentially the root cause for latency issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Refer to the [Azure Files scale targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets#file-share-and-file-scale-targets) to learn more about the scalability targets
* Refer to the [Azure Files extensive open/close operations causing latency workaround](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshooting-files-performance#high-latencies-for-metadata-heavy-workloads-involving-extensive-openclose-operations) to mitigate latency issues
* Refer to the [Azure Files heavy metadata workload workaround](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshooting-files-performance#cause-2-metadatanamespace-heavy-workload) to mitigate latency issues
* If the file share is a standard file share, check if [larger file shares](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-planning#onboard-to-larger-file-shares-standard-tier) is available in your region. Larger file shares support up to 10,000 IOPS per share.

# Running VM attached
<!--issueDescription-->
## **Running VM has been detected**
Microsoft Azure has concluded an investigation of your delete operation against your storage account <!--$StorageAccountName-->[StorageAccountName]<!--/$StorageAccountName-->:**. We identified that The VM <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->, is actively running. That’s preventing the deletion of your <!--$StorageAccountName-->[StorageAccountName]<!--/$StorageAccountName--> storage account. You will have to stop & delete the VM before you can delete the storage account.<br>

# Blob Recovery with soft delete disabled

<!--issueDescription-->

Client side recovery of storage blob **{BlobPath}** is not supported because soft delete is disabled on storage account **{ResourceName}**. Manual recovery from server side is also not possible. We have run the backend check and find that some data has been permanently lost, so the data cannot be recovered.

Third-party services running outside Azure must ensure that their IPs are in the allowed list when Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks is configured.<br> 

Only the following IPs are allowed to access Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**:
<!--$IPRules-->[IPRules]<!--/$IPRules-->

You can [grant access to the associated IP ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#grant-access-from-an-internet-ip-range) to ensure that your application IP is in the allowed list.

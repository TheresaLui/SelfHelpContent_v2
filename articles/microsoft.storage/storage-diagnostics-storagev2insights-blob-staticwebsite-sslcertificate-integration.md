<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Currently the way to configure **[custom SSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-custom-domain#enable-custom-domain-and-ssl)** certificate with Static Website is to use **[Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-https-custom-domain-cdn)**. CDN provides consistent low latencies to your website from anywhere in the world.</br> While CDN comes at an additional cost, we have made it a compelling option with the removal of storage egress cost.

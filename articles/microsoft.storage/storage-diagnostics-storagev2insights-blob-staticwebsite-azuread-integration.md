# Does Static Website support Azure AD?

<!--issueDescription-->
Static Website does not currently support Azure AD authentication.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Currently, Static Website doesn't support **[Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad)** authentication even though the blob endpoint does. The web endpoint could be publicly accessed by anonymously by anyone connected to the internet.

Static website also does not support use of social IDPs like Google Auth or Facebook using OpenID Connect.

# Unable to create storage account with CMK enabled

<!--issueDescription-->

Storage account <!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName--> creation failed at <!--$IssueTime-->[IssueTime]<!--/$IssueTime--> because customer-managed key (CMK) is being enabled without Azure Key Vault (AKV) provisioned. 

Please ensure Azure Key Vault is provisioned and access policies are created to grant storage account permissions to Azure Key Vault prior to enabling encryption with Customer Managed Key on storage account.

# Lifecycle Management doesn't execute when Storage Firewall is enabled without "Trusted Services" selected

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected that Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks is currently configured on the storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**, but doesn't have **Trusted Microsoft** services selected as an exception. Lifecycle management requests are issued via the Microsoft.Insights service which is a trusted Microsoft Service. These requests get blocked when **Trusted Microsoft Services** is not selected in the firewall exception list.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* For successful execution of Lifecycle management policies on the storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** , add **Trusted Services** as an exception

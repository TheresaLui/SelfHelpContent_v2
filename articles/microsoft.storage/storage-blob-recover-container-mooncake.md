# Recover deleted Container

## **Recommended steps**

Container recovery is only possible under the following conditions. Please check if:

1.  Container was deleted in the last 14 days
2.  Storage Account replication is configured as [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs) or [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)
3. A new Container with the same name has not been created since

**Note:** As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten. This blob container and all its content may not be recoverable by Azure even when all conditions above are true.

Follow our [best practices for protecting your data](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#best-practices-for-protecting-your-data) to ensure that accidentally deleted content can be recovered in the future.

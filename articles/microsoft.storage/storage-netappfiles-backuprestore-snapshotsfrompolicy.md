# Common NetApp Volumes Issues Creating snapshots from Policy

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure that the snapshot policy feature is registered.
If you are using this feature for the first time, you need to register the feature first. In Azure PowerShell, enter `Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSnapshotPolicy`.

2. Make sure that sum of all snapshots including snapshots configured from policy and on demand snapshots does not exceed more than 255 as we have a limit of 255 snapshots per volume. Refer [Resource Limits for Azure NetApp Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-resource-limits)

3. Also make sure that the policy is enabled from netapp account page

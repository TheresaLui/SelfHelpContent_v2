# **Cannot recover resources that was deleted over 14 days ago**

<!--issueDescription-->

Microsoft Azure identified that <!--$ResourceType-->[ResourceType]<!--/$ResourceType--> **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** is not recoverable. Unfortunately, our system is unable to recover <!--$ResourceType-->[ResourceType]<!--/$ResourceType--> that was deleted more than 14 days ago.<br>

Please follow our [Best Practices for protecting your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#best-practices-for-protecting-your-data) to ensure that your deleted data will be recoverable in the future. <br>

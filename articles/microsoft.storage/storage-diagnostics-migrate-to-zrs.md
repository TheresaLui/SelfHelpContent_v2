# Migrate to ZRS within a region

<!--issueDescription-->
Changing redundancy type to zone redundant storage (ZRS) involves moving the physical data from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a qualified region. <br>Live migration is only supported for Standard accounts. Premium accounts are not supported.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** is not in a qualified region

We were able to successfully migrate Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->. 

Please check [Qualified Region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs#support-coverage-and-regional-availability) for more information

2. Unable to migrate Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** to ZRS due to account type is premium

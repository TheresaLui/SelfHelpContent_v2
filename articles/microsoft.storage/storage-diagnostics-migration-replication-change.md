# Cannot change storage account replication type due to system maintenance

<!--issueDescription-->
 A maintenance operation is occuring on your storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**. This operation does not impact regular storage operations but prevents changing the replication type on the storage account. It could take between 1-7 days for this maintenance operation to complete. We sincerely apologize for the inconvienence.<br>

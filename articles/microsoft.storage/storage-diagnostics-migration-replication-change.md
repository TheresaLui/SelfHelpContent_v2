 # **Cannot change replication type due to system maintenance**

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure identified that a maintenance operation is occuring on your Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**. This operation does not impact regular storage operations but prevents changing replication type on the Storage Account. It could take up to a week for this operation to complete, and we recommend retrying changing your replication type again later. We sincerely apologize for the inconvienence.<br>

Regards,<br>
Microsoft Azure Team

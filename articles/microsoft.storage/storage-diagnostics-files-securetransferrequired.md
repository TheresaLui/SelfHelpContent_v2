# SMB clients that do not support encryption will be unable to access Azure file shares 

<!--issueDescription-->
The **Secure transfer required** setting is enabled on storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**. SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.0 clients that do not support encryption will be unable to access Azure file shares. To learn more about the impact of having the **Secure transfer required** setting enabled, see [Require secure transfer in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer).
<!--/issueDescription-->

## Recommended steps**

Disable the **Secure transfer required** setting on storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** if SMB clients do not support encryption.

# Deleted blob is recoverable until **<!--$RecoveryTime-->[RecoveryTime]<!--/$RecoveryTime-->**

<!--issueDescription-->
The storage blob **<!--$BlobPath-->[BlobPath]<!--/$BlobPath-->** that was deleted on **<!--$DeletionTime-->[DeletionTime]<!--/$DeletionTime-->** is recoverable because soft delete is enabled for the storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**. The blob can be recovered if the recovery operation is completed before **<!--$RecoveryTime-->[RecoveryTime]<!--/$RecoveryTime-->**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Please use theÂ [Undelete Blob API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete#recovery) to perform recovery.

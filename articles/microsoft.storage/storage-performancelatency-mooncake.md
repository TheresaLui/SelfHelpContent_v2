# Troubleshoot latency issues

## **Recommended steps**
Diagnosing and troubleshooting latency issues in a distributed application hosted in a cloud environment can be complex. Here are some common latency scenarios your metrics may turn up, and how to troubleshoot them. 

Do you have baseline metrics? The performance of an application can be subjective, especially from a user perspective. Therefore, it is important to have baseline metrics available to help you identify where there might be a performance issue. 

1. [Metrics show high AverageE2ELatency and low AverageServerLatency](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting#metrics-show-high-AverageE2ELatency-and-low-AverageServerLatency)
2. [Metrics show low AverageE2ELatency and low AverageServerLatency but the client is experiencing high latency](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting#metrics-show-low-AverageE2ELatency-and-low-AverageServerLatency)

4. [You are experiencing unexpected delays in message delivery on a queue](https://docs.azure.cn/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting#you-are-experiencing-unexpected-delays-in-message-delivery)

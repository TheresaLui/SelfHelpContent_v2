Microsoft Azure team has concluded the investigation of performance issue while accessing <!--$SAname-->Storage account<!--/$SAname--> on **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**. Your application is experiencing high end to end latency due to resource contention on client side.<br>

The Azure Storage service side latency was <avg ms> but client perceived latency spiked to <avg ms> at or around **<!--$StartTime--> StartTime <!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**.<br>
Please refer to Performance Analysis and Troubleshooting guide on the client application to further investigate and mitigate the issue.<br>

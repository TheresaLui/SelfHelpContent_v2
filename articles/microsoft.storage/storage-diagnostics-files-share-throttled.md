# An Azure file share in storage account <!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName--> was throttled
<!--issueDescription-->
An Azure file share in storage account <!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName--> was throttled due to IOPS (transactions) limit reached.

Refer to the [Azure Files scale targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets#file-share-and-file-scale-targets) to learn more about the scalability targets.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

If the file share is a standard file share, check if [larger file shares](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-planning#onboard-to-larger-file-shares-standard-tier) is available in your region. Larger file shares support up to 10,000 IOPS per share.

If the file share is a premium file share, increase the provisioned file share size to increase the IOPS limit. To learn more, see the [provisioned shares](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-planning#provisioned-shares) section in the Azure Files planning guide.

# Resource group recover

## Another account with the same name must be deleted before recovery

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure team cannot recover deleted storage account(s) in Resource Group **<!--$ResourceGroupName-->[ResourceGroupName]<!--/$ResourceGroupName-->** that was deleted on **<!--$DeletionTime-->[DeletionTime]<!--/$DeletionTime-->** because another account with the same name has since been created<!--/issueDescription-->:

<!--$DeletionInfo_Recreated-->[DeletionInfo_Recreated]<!--/$DeletionInfo_Recreated-->

<!--/issueDescription-->

[Storage account names must be unique within Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account#create-a-storage-account) so it is not possible to recover deleted storage accounts with the same name as another live account in Azure. If you are the owner of these new storage accounts, you will need to delete the new accounts before we can attempt recovery of the deleted ones. Our recovery attempt is based on best effort and we cannot guarantee that it will succeed. Please backup your data in the new storage account before deletion.

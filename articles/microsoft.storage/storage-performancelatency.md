# Troubleshoot latency issues
## **Recommended steps**

**How to Monitor performance for Storage Services**

1. [Monitor Storage performance using Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting#monitoring-performance) to identify increase in latency when compared to your baseline<br>

**Common Storage Performance Diagnostics and Troubleshooting**

2. [Troubleshoot latency increase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#troubleshooting-guidance) when using Azure Storage<br>

**Troubleshoot client side performance issues when facing high end-to-end latency**

3. [Troubelshoot client performance issues when Average end-to-end latency is much higher than Average Server side latency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#investigating-client-performance-issues)<br>

4. [Troubleshoot high client latency issues when metrics show low Average end-to-end latency and low Average server side latency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#metrics-show-low-AverageE2ELatency-and-low-AverageServerLatency)<br>

**Increase AzCopy Performance for Data Transfer**

5. [Optimizing Throughput/Performance - Increase concurrent requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-configure?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#optimize-throughput)<br>

# Troubleshoot latency issues

## **Recommended Steps**

### How to Monitor performance for Storage Services

* [Monitor Storage performance using Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting#monitoring-performance) to identify increase in latency when compared to your baseline

### Common Storage Performance Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

* [Troubleshoot latency increase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#troubleshooting-guidance) when using Azure Storage

### Troubleshoot client side performance issues when facing high end-to-end latency

* [Troubleshoot client performance issues when Average end-to-end latency is much higher than Average Server side latency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#investigating-client-performance-issues)<br>
* [Troubleshoot high client latency issues when metrics show low Average end-to-end latency and low Average server side latency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#metrics-show-low-AverageE2ELatency-and-low-AverageServerLatency)

### Increase AzCopy Performance for Data Transfer

* [Optimizing Throughput/Performance - Increase concurrent requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-configure?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#optimize-throughput)

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Troubleshoot latency using Storage Analytics logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/troubleshoot-latency-storage-analytics-logs)

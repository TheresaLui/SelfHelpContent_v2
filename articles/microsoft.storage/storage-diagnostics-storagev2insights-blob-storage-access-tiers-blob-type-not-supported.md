 * Page blob - These can't be moved to a different tier
 * Append blob - These can't be moved to a different tier  

## **Recommended Documents**

 * [Storage accounts that support tiering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers#storage-accounts-that-support-tiering)

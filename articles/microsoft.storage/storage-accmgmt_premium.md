# What is Azure Premium Storage
Microsoft Azure Premium Storage delivers high-performance, low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) running I/O-intensive workloads. VM disks that use Premium Storage store data on solid state drives (SSDs). You can migrate your application's VM disks to Azure Premium Storage to take advantage of the speed and performance of these disks.

An Azure VM supports attaching several premium storage disks, so that your applications can have up to 64 TB of storage per VM. With Premium Storage, your applications can achieve 80,000 input/output operations per second (IOPS) per VM and disk throughput up to 2000 MB/s per VM with extremely low latencies for read operations.

With Premium Storage, Azure offers the ability to truly lift-and-shift your demanding enterprise applications such as Dynamics AX, Dynamics CRM, Exchange Server, SharePoint Farms, and SAP Business Suite to the cloud. You can run a variety of performance intensive database workloads like SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis that require consistent high performance and low latency on Premium Storage.

# Unable to create Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->**
The Storage Account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** cannot be created at this time because another Storage Account with the same name was recently deleted. You can either create another Storage Account with a different name now or wait up to 14 days from when the previous Storage Account was deleted.

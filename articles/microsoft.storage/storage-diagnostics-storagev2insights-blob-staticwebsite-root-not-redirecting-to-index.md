# Why is Root not redirecting to the page set for "index document name"?

<!--issueDescription-->
Ensure the name and extension as set in the file name on portal is the exact same of the file in the $web container including case sensitivity. For Static Website file names along with extensions are case sensitive even though served over HTTP, therefore index.html != Index.html.

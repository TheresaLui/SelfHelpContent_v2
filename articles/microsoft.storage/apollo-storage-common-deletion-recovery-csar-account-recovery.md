## Recover Deleted Storage Account

:::Section Recommended solutions:::

### Initiate Account Recovery

### <span style="color:red">**Conditions for a storage account to be recoverable:**

- A new storage object with the same name has not been re-created since deletion.
- The storage account was deleted in the last 14 days, including today. If the storage account was deleted prior to that, it can't be recovered.
- It is not a classic storage account.

### <span style="color:red">**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure that the Resource Group is created first, if it has been deleted.
- Ensure that the KeyVault key is associated with the storage account if it is encrypted with CMK. Failing to do so would result in HTTP 403 failures when accessing endpoints (currently blob and file) of the recovered account.

### <span style="color:red">**Disclaimer:**

- There's no guarantee that recovery will always succeed. Recovery is a best effort rather than a guarantee.
- We strongly recommend using a combination of [ARM resource locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources) and [Azure RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) permissions to prevent accidental account deletion.

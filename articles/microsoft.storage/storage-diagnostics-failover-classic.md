# Classic account cannot failover

<!--issueDescription-->
Account Failover does not support classic storage account. Account failover is supported for new and existing Azure Resource Manager storage accounts that are configured for RA-GRS and GRS. Storage accounts may be general-purpose v1 (GPv1), general-purpose v2 (GPv2), or Blob storage accounts. Account failover is currently supported in US-West 2 and US-West Central.

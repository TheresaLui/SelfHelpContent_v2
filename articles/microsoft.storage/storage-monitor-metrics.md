## **Recommended Steps**

On August 31, 2023 Storage Analytics metrics, also referred to as classic metrics will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-storage-classic-metrics-will-be-retired-on-31-august-2023/). If you use classic metrics, make sure to transition to metrics in Azure Monitor prior to that date. This article helps you make the transition.

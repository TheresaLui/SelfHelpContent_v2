# Recover deleted Container

## **Recommended steps**

Container recovery is only possible under the following conditions. Please check if:

1.  Container was deleted in the last 14 days<br> 
2.  Storage Account replication is configured as [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs) or [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)<br>
3. A new Container with the same name has not been created since

**Note:** Garbage collection could occur on our system at any time, so we cannot guarantee successful recovery.

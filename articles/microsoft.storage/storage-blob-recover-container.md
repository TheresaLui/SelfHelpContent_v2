# Recover deleted Container

## **Recommended Steps**

Container recovery is only possible under the following conditions. Please check whether:

1. The container was deleted in the last 14 days<br> 
2. Storage account replication is configured as one of the following (we need the geo-replicated data for recovery):
   * [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs)
   * [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs#read-access-geo-redundant-storage)
   * [Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-gzrs?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json) <br>
3. A new container with the same name has not been created

**Note:** As part of our [data privacy guarantee](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Privacy/default.aspx), we ensure that the data deleted by our customer is eventually overwritten. Recovery is a best-effort process, this container may not be recoverable even when all conditions above are true.

Follow our [best practices for protecting your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json#best-practices-for-protecting-your-data) to ensure that accidentally deleted content can be recovered in the future.

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
Currently the way to configure **[custom domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-custom-domain#enable-custom-domain-and-ssl)** with Static Website is to use **[Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-https-custom-domain-cdn)**. CDN provides consistent low latencies to your website from anywhere in the world.</br>While CDN comes at an additional cost we have made it a compelling option with the removal of storage egress cost.

# Connections to storage account endpoint were blocked due to **User Delegation SAS** token failures
<!--issueDescription-->
Some requests to the storage account **<!--$ResourceName-->[ResourceName]<!--/$ResourceName-->** were blocked between **<!--$StartTime-->[StartTime]<!--/$StartTime-->** and **<!--$EndTime-->[EndTime]<!--/$EndTime-->** as the __user delegation SAS__ token presented was not valid to perform the operation.

**Sample list of blocked requests with failure reason:**

<!--$SampleRequestTable-->[SampleRequestTable]<!--/$SampleRequestTable-->

<!--/issueDescription-->


**Note**: There may be more client IPs for which requests were blocked. To view the exhaustive list, review the [storage analytics log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-analytics#about-storage-analytics-logging).

## **Recommended Steps**

Storage requests using __user delegation SAS__ to authenticate should pass a valid unexpired token with right permissions to perform the intended operation.

Please look at the reason above and modify the __user delegation SAS__ token accordingly. Below are some documents that might assist you.

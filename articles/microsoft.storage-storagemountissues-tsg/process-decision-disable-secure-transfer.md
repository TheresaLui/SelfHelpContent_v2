### Disable Secure Transfer

**How to check Secure Transfer**

When you use the Azure Files service, any connection without encryption fails when Secure transfer required is enabled. This includes scenarios that use SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0 without encryption, and some versions of the Linux SMB client.

1. Sign to Azure portal
2. Go to the storage account that hosts the Azure file share.
3. Select Configuration, make sure that the Secure transfer required option is disabled.

# Lost time stamps

**Symptoms**

Time stamps were lost in copying files from Windows to Linux. On Linux/Unix platforms, the cp -p command fails if file 1 and file 2 are owned by different users.

**Cause**

The force flag f in COPYFILE results in executing cp -p -f on Unix. This command also fails to preserve the time stamp of the file that you don't own.

**Workaround**

Use the storage account user for copying the files:

1. Useadd : [storage account name]
2. Passwd [storage account name]
3. su [storage account name]
4. cp -p filename.txt /share

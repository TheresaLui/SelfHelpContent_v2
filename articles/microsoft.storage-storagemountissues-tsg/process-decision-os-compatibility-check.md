# Check for OS compatibility

**How to check for OS compatibility**

1. Windows: To mount an Azure file share outside of the Azure region it is hosted in, such as on-premises or in a different Azure region, the client's OS must support SMB 3.0 with encryption.

        Check the following table to see if the client that you used to mount the file share supports SMB 3.0

2. Linux: To mount an Azure file share outside of the Azure region it is hosted in, such as on-premises or in a different Azure region, the clients OS must support SMB 3.0 with encryption.

        SMB 3.0 encryption support was introduced in Linux kernel version 4.11.

# Submitting experiments in Azure Automated ML

In this article, you learn the multiple options you can submit and experiment in Azure Automated Machine Learning.

There are two compute environments you can deploy an Automated ML experiment:
* Local compute (The same machine you are running your Python code or Notebook)
* Azure ML compute (Training clusters or AmlCompute)

You can easily scale up or scale out your ML experiment by adding additional compute targets, such as Training clusters of Azure ML Compute (AmlCompute). 

AmlCompute is a managed-compute infrastructure that allows you to easily create a single or multi-node compute.

# Unable to delegate resources

Most users are able to delegate resources using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Can't delegate resources to a service provider?**

- Delegation must be done by a non-guest account in the customer's tenant which has the Owner built-in role for the subscription being onboarded (or which contains the resource groups that are being onboarded)
  - To see all users who can delegate the subscription, a user in the customer's tenant can select the subscription in the Azure portal, open Access control (IAM), and view all users with the Owner role

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Delegate resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/how-to/view-manage-service-providers#delegate-resources)
* [List owners of a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal#list-owners-of-a-subscription)

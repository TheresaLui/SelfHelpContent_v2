# ADLS Gen 2 Recovery

<!--issueDescription-->

1. There is no change in terms of **ADLS Gen2 Accounts**. Follow the same process as that of General Purpose accounts <br>

2. For blobs and containers, continue to file ICM with XStore/BigData as appropriate. If you don't have access to create an ICM with Big Data team, create a Storage ICM and engage one of the Storage TAs or email cssstorageta@microsoft.com to route the ICM to Table Server team.

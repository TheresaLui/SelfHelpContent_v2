# XRecovery Storage Account recovery for a Disabled Subscription #

<!--issueDescription-->

**Storage Account recovery for a Disabled Subscription**

1.  If customer accidentally deleted the storage account and subsequently his subscription got disabled, file an ICM with XStore/Location Service team. If you don't have access to create an ICM with XStore/Location service team, engage one of the storage TAs or email cssstorageta@microsoft.com route the ICM, provided it meets all the other basic criteria of account recovery.

2.  If the subscription got deactivated and customer wants to get his storage account recovered, this is out of scope of Storage Account Recovery.

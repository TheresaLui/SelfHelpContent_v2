# How to check if qualifies for recovery attempt  Storage Account Recovery Classic / ARM

1. Ensure storage account does not exist currently. 
2. Account name should not have been reused. 
3. Customer should NOT recreate a storage account with the same name. 
4. In some cases, recreating a storage account with the same name will cause the original storage account data to be cleaned up early making it unrecoverable. 
5. If the customer has already re-created the account, they will need to delete it first before recovery can be attempted.
6. Storage account was deleted less than 14 days ago.

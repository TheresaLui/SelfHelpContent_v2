# ADLS Gen 1 Recovery #

<!--issueDescription-->

1. This is available 'as-is', and there is no guarantee of recovery <br>
2. When this happens, ADLS Gen 1 name, sub and possible the folders/files to be recovered is what should be provided <br>
3. ADLS Gen 1 PG should be contacted as soon as possible after the accidental delete <br>

**In addition for encrypted accounts:**

* We are unable to recover an encrypted account to an alternate account name. If an account with the same name has been created after the delete, recovery will not be possible. <br>

* If the account used a customer managed master encryption key stored in Azure Key Vault, the Key Vault and/or master encryption key must be restored and access given to ADLS Gen 1 before recovery can proceed. If this cannot be done, recover will not be possible.

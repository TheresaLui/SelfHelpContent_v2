# Why don’t I see forecasts for my costs in Cost Analysis?

There are multiple reasons why the forecast projection might be missing for you in Cost Analysis, some of them are as follows:<br>

1. If your cost data is less than 10 days old, the forecast chart will not load. The model requires at least 10 days of recent cost data for accurate projections<br>
2. If you have selected historic dates, then the forecast chart will not be visible. Please select a date range with future dates for the forecast chart to be displayed<br>
3. If your account has multiple currencies, the forecast chart will only project costs for **All costs in USD**<br>

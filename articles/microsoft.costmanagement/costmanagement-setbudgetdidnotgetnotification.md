# I setup an alert on my budget and didn't receive a notification

There are a few reasons why you might not have received a notification.

1. **You did not exceed the budget threshhold**. Verify that you exceeded the budget threshold by opening Cost Management and selecting your budget with the scope picker

2. **It was sent to your junk / spam folder**

3. **Your configured account email address is invalid**

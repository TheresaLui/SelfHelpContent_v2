# Why don't I see my subscriptions in Cost Management?

Azure Cost Management supports pay-as-you-go (PAYG), Enterprise Agreement (EA), and Microsoft Customer Agreement subscriptions. Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions that are part of a Microsoft Customer Agreement supported by partners are also supported. 

The following are coming soon:

* Sponsorship
* CSP (not part of Microsoft Customer Agreement)

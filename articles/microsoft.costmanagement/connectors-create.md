# I’m unable to create a connector using my AWS credentials

This may happen due to the following reasons:<br> 

1) Invalid AWS credentials. Please check your AWS credentials and whether they are active. <br>
2) Only 1 connector can be created for a consolidated account. Hence, if someone has already created a connector for the same consolidated account, we suggest you reach out to them to grant you access to the connector.

# Why does my forecast increase after I make a reservation or Marketplace purchase?

The forecast model considers your **'Actual Cost'** and does not account for usage and purchase separately <br>

For a one-time purchase, the model will decrease the projections after 10 days to account for the sudden increase in costs <br>

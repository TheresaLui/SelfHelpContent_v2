# Why doesn’t the forecast change when I make changes to my resources?

The forecast model requires a couple of days to account for changes in the account and does not make immediate projections based on change in resources <br>

For larger steps of increase or decrease in resources, the model will take slightly longer to adjust to these changes to account for anomalies <br>

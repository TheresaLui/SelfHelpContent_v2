# How do I see the cost of each resource I'm using?

Azure Cost Management offers 5 built-in views to serve as a starting point for you to understand and analyze costs.
Open the view menu (between the scope and date pills) to reveal a list of all saved, shared, and built-in views. 

Use the **Cost by resource** view to see costs broken down by each resource, 
sorted from most to least expensive within the date range (defaults to the current billing period).

To see the individual meters for a specific resource, apply a resource filter and group by meter.

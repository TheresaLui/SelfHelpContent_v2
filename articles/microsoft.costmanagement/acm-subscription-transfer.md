# I transferred my subscription to a new billing account owner and now I cannot see costs. Why?

Once a subscription transfer is made, the only information available to the users in new billing account is the last month's cost for your subscription. <br> 
The rest of the usage and billing history doesn't transfer with the subscription.<br>
To see prior usage and cost, you must continue to navigate to the old account. <br>
If you have RBAC access to the subscription itself (as opposed to the billing account), however, you can see costs before/after by navigating to the subscription scope within Cost Management.<br>

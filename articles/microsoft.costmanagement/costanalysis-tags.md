# Tags I have set on resources are missing from Cost Management, can you explain why?

Most taggable Azure services, emit tags to the Cost Management platform. However, a few services are yet to complete this work <br>  
 
The following services donâ€™t emit tags yet to the Cost Management platform:

* Azure Active Directory Domain Services
* Azure Bastion
* Azure Event Grid
* Azure Firewall
* Azure NetApp Files
* Azure SQL Managed Instance (Databases)
* Azure Storage | Advanced Threat Protection
* Azure Subscriptions (Tag at sub level
* Notification Hub

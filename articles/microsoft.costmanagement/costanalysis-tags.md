# Tags I have set on resources are missing from Cost Management, can you explain why?

Most taggable Azure services, emit tags to the Cost Management platform. However, a few services are yet to complete this work <br>  
 
The following services donâ€™t emit tags yet to the Cost Management platform:

* Azure Networking - VPN Gateway
* Azure ExpressRoute
* Azure Eventgrid
* Azure Firewall
* Azure Databricks
* Notification Hub
* Azure Subscriptions (Tag at sub level)
* Azure Compute | Disk Resource Provider (RP)
* Azure DataFactory
* Azure AppServices 
 
This is work in progress and we will update this list if any change occurs <br>

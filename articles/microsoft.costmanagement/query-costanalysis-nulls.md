# Why am I seeing "not applicable", "unassigned", or "others"?

"Not applicable" is shown when a value is empty. Here are a few reasons you might see "not applicable":

1. Tenant resources, which arenâ€™t deployed within a subscription, will not have a resource group. This is expected. To validate this, download the data and review the ResourceId column.
2. Classic resources do not have a resource group. If you see a non-classic resource without a resource group, please contact support.
3. Purchases do not have a subscription, resource group, or resource. All of these values will show "not applicable".  To validate that this amount is from a purchase, switch to the **Invoice details** view and look at for a charge type of "purchase".

You may see an "unassigned" location for services which are not configured with a specific location. They may be global services, as an example.

"Others" is used in 2 contexts. A lowercase "others" resource group represents a missing or empty resource group. These are typically for classic resources. If you see "Others" as the last item in a chart that is grouped by a specific property, it represents all the remaining groups that aren't shown. Switch to the table view and set granularity to **None** to view all groups.

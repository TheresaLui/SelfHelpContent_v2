# How do I see the cost of each resource I'm using?

Azure Cost Management offers 5 built-in views to serve as a starting point for you to understand and analyze costs. 
Use the **Cost by resource** view to see costs broken down by each resource, sorted from most to least expensive within the date range (defaults to the current billing period).

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Open the view menu (between the scope and date pills)
2. Select **Cost by resource**
3. To see the individual meters for a specific resource, apply a resource filter and group by meter
4. To view a previous period, click the date pill and select a different date range

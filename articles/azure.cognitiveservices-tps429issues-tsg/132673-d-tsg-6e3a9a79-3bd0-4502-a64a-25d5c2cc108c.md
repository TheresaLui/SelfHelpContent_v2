# Not supported sku tier

F0/Free-tiers: Since they are free tier, we do not support increasing TPS for free tier. Also one azure subscription can not have more than one (1) free tier account.

Solution/Recommendation: Upgrade to Standard tier (S0/S1/...), even if the customer scenario is to "try out" the api at a higher scale.
Special case: QnA Maker once had a bug that allowed creating more than one (1) free tier account but was fixed as part of PR - 3015037. Before the change, they may have had more than 1 but now new creations would fail. Recommend them to upgrade to S0/paid tiers

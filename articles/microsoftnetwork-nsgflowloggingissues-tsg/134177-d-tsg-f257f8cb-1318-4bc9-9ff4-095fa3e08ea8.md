# Differentiate between flow log data discrepancies

There are two very similar but different issues that have very different causes and solutions relating to missing flow log data: entirely missing flow logs and missing values/data within a delivered flow log. 

### Are logs missing? 

Are there gaps in the logs received but for all received logs, all data is populated? 

### Are data missing? 

Are all logs received but some fields are showing as empty or null? "

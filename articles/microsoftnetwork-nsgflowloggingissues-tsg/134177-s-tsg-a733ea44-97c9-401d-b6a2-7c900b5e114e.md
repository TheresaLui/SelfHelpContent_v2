# Missing Data

<!--issueDescription-->

### Resolution for Missing Data within NSG Flow Logs<br><br>The data is missing from these NSGs due to how the platform handles some scenarios. <br>The mitigation is to have support enable a Idle Time Out flag on the VNet resource. This will allow logging of all expected flows. <br><br>Please confirm with your support engineer that you would like this feature enabled and we can enable this for you on your subscription.

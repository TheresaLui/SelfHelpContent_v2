### Best Practices for NSG Flow Logs
We publish best practices for NSG Flow logs, some of which can impact functionality when not implemented or not implemented correctly. Let's review these now:
- Enable NSG Flow Logging on All NSGs attached to a resource. 
- Storage provisioned in tune with the expected flow log volume. 
-The NSG name is limited to up to 80 characters and the NSG rule names up to 65 characters. 

Is the customer following the above best practices found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#best-practices)?

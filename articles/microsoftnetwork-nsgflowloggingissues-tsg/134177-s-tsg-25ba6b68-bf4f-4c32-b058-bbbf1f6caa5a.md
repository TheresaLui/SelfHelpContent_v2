# Customer is using multiple NICs or NSGs

<!--issueDescription-->

### Best Practices for Implementation<br>In scenarios where multiple NSGs are utilized, we recommend enabling NSG flow logs on all NSGs applied at the resource's subnet or network interface to ensure that all traffic is recorded.<br><br>This includes NSGs at both the NIC and subnet level as well as a VM having multiple NICs. <br><br>For more information regarding this scenario, you may refer to the [Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview#best-practices) document.<br>

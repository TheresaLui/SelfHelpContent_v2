# Validate scope of issue

Verify the customer issue is a match for this ***Issues with NSG Flow Logging*** guided troubleshooter. Customers often misunderstand or misapply the term 'flow logging'. They will often apply it to diagnostic logs for NSGs or Azure Firewalls. 

### **How to verify customer issue is in scope for this TSG**

1. Check the customer verbatim to determine if it is clear they are having issues with NSG Flow Logs
2. Use the details in the customer verbatim and review corresponding Flow Log resource in Azure Support Center > Resource Explorer to validate there is a flow log configured and the storage account is the one as specified in the verbatim 
3. Contact the customer to scope the issue and determine if customer issue is related to data being unavailable after configuring NSG Flow Logs

# Failed to process model with data source through gateway

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Open the config file **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config** under the installation directory of the unified gateway (typically it's **%systemdrive%\Program Files\On-premises data gateway**)
2. Find the **SendTelemetry** setting in the config and change the value to **False**
3. Restart the gateway service **On-premise data gateway service**
4. If processing continues to fail, please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) to resolve this issue

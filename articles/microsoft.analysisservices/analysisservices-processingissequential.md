# Processing of partition is sequential

When you process multiple partitions at a time in SSMS, you can make it parallel using this method.

1. Right click on the table which you want to process, and select "Partitions...".
2. In the pop-up window (**Partitions**), click the refresh button in the toolbar of the "Partitions" area.
3. In the second pop-up window (**Process Partition(s)**), select process mode and check all partitions which you want to process, and then click the "Script" button.
4. Execute the query generated by previous steps from SSMS query window.
5. If you want to process multiple partitions across different tables at a time, you can manually write the query and execute it from SSMS query window.

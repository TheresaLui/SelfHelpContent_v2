# Processing of partition is sequential

When you process multiple partitions at a time in SSMS, you can make it parallel using this method:

1. Right click on the table which you want to process and select "Partitions..."
2. In the pop-up window (**Partitions**), click the refresh button in the toolbar of the "Partitions" area
3. In the second pop-up window (**Process Partition(s)**), select the process mode, check all the partitions which you want to process and then click the "Script" button
4. Execute the query generated by the previous steps from an SSMS query window
5. If you want to process multiple partitions across different tables at a time you can manually write the query and execute it from an SSMS query window

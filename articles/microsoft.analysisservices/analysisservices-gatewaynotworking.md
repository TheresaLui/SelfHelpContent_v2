# On-premises data gateway is not working

While processing, if you see an error like **Gateway on endpoint '<endpoint uri>' is unreachable**, make sure the gateway is configured correctly and it is associated with the AS server.

## **Recommended steps**

1. Open the **On-premises data gateway** in the on-premises server and sign in, check the name and the region, and make sure the network status is **Connected**.
2. Open **System Information** in the on-premises server and check the System Name (hostname).
3. Browse the **On-premises Data Gateway** blade of the AS server in the Azure portal, make sure that **AS Region** is same as the region configured in the **On-premises data gateway**.
4. Browse the overview blade of the **On-premises Data Gateway** associated with the AS server, make sure that the **Machine name** is the same as the on-premises server.

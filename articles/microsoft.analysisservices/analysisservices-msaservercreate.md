# Creating a server using a Microsoft account

## **Recommended steps**
When logged in to Azure portal using a **Microsoft account**, if you create an Analysis Services server, the server will be provisioned without any Analysis Services administrators. Analysis Services currently supports only **Organizational accounts** (also known as Work or school accounts) as administrators. You can add organizational accounts to administrators by going to the **Analysis Services Admins** blade.

# Creating a server using a Microsoft account

## **Recommended steps**
If you are logged in to the Azure portal using a **Microsoft account** when creating an Analysis Services server, the server will be provisioned without any Analysis Services Administrators. Analysis Services currently supports only **"Work or School accounts"** (also known as **Organizational accounts**). To add a **Work or School account** as an Analysis Services Administrator, go to the **Analysis Services Admins** blade. This allows you to add users or groups in your organization as administrators.

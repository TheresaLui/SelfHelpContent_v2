# I am seeing run or trigger failures

## **Recommended steps**

To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following methods.

1. Click on the run or trigger that has the **Failure** status.
2. Find the error code for the action that failed for more information on what caused the issue.

	- For reference errors, be sure to check the outputs of previous steps to make sure they match what is expected in next step.
	- For invalid template errors, check expressions against the [workflow definition language](https://docs.azure.cn/logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-definition-language)

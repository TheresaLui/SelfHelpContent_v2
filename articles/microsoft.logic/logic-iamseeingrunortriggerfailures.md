# I am seeing run or trigger failures

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following methods.

1. Click on the run or trigger that has the **Failure** status.
1. Find the error code for the action that failed for more information on what caused the issue.
	- For reference errors, be sure to check the outputs of previous steps to make sure they match what is expected in next step.
	- For invalid template errors, check expressions against the [workflow definition language](http://aka.ms/logicappsdocs)

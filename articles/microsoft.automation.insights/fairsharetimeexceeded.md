# Runbook was stopped and evicted because it exceeded the fair share time limit
## **The runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, was stopped and evicted after exceeding the fair share time limit**
We have investigated and identified that your runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, was stopped and evicted <!--$FailedJobs-->[FailedJobs]<!--/$FailedJobs--> times in the <!--$TimeRange-->[TimeRange]<!--/$TimeRange--> days prior to case creation. It exceeded the <!--$TimeLimit-->[TimeLimit]<!--/$TimeLimit--> minute [fair share](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-execution#fair-share).
### Recommended Steps
To avoid runbook failures caused by exceeding the fair share time limit, follow these steps: 

#### 1) Implement the recommendations in the [Fair Share documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-execution#fair-share) including:

- Use a [Powershell Workflow runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-first-runbook-textual) to checkpoint the runbook. This allows the runbook to be restarted.  
- Execute the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker). Hybrid workers do not impose a job limit on job execution time.

#### 2) Optimize the runbook
Another option is to optimize the runbook.

One optimization option is to create child runbooks. If your runbook loops through the same function on a number of resources, such as a database operation on several databases, you can move that function to a [child runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-child-runbooks). Each of these child runbooks executes in parallel in separate processes decreasing the total amount of time for the parent runbook to complete.

The PowerShell cmdlets that enable this scenario are:

- [Start-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/start-azurermautomationrunbook) This cmdlet allows you to start a runbook and pass parameters to the runbook
- [Get-AzureRmAutomationJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/Get-AzureRmAutomationJob) This cmdlet allows you to check the job status for each child if there are operations that need to be performed after the child runbook completes.

# Runbook was stopped or failed because it exceeded the fair share time limit

<!--/issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that your runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, was stopped or failed <!--$FailedJobs-->[FailedJobs]<!--/$FailedJobs--> times in the <!--$TimeRange-->[TimeRange]<!--/$TimeRange--> days prior to case creation. It exceeded the <!--$TimeLimit-->[TimeLimit]<!--/$TimeLimit--> minute fair share time limit.
<!--/issueDescription-->


## **Recommended Steps**

To avoid runbook failures caused by exceeding the fair share time limit, follow these steps: 

1. Implement the recommendations in the [Fair Share documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-execution#fair-share)
2. Execute the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker), which does not impose a limit on job execution time
3. Optimize the runbook by starting child runbooks from the parent runbook. If your runbook loops through the same function on a number of resources, such as a database operation on several databases, you can move that function to a [child runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-child-runbooks#starting-a-child-runbook-using-cmdlet). Each of these child runbooks will execute in parallel in separate processes, and thereby decrease the total amount of time for the parent runbook to complete. The PowerShell cmdlets that enable this scenario are:

  - [Start-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/start-azurermautomationrunbook): This cmdlet allows you to start a runbook and pass parameters to the runbook.  Determine if you need to use the -Wait parameter to wait for the child job to complete and the output of the child runbook to be returned.  If you don't need to wait for the child runbook then don't use the -Wait parameter, and the parent runbook will finish even more quickly
  - [Get-AzureRmAutomationJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/Get-AzureRmAutomationJob): If you start child runbooks using the above cmdlet and don't use the -Wait parameter, but you still need to know if the child job has finished and perhaps collect the job output, then you can use this cmdlet to check the job status for each child.

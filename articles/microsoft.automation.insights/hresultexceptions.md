## **Recommended Steps**

Review the following table for potential solutions or actions to take:

|Exception  |Resolution or Action  |
|---------|---------|
|`Exception from HRESULT: 0x……C`     | Search the relevant error code in [Windows update error code list](https://support.microsoft.com/help/938205/windows-update-error-code-list) to find additional details on the cause of the exception.        |
|`0x8024402C`</br>`0x8024401C`</br>`0x8024402F`      | These errors are network connectivity issues. Make sure that your machine has the proper network connectivity to Update Management. See the section on [network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-management#ports) for a list of ports and addresses that are required.        |
|`0x8024001E`| The update operation did not complete because the service or system was shutting down.|
|`0x8024002E`| Windows Update service is disabled.|
|`0x8024402C`     | If you are using a WSUS server, make sure the registry values for `WUServer` and `WUStatusServer` under the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate` have the correct WSUS server.        |
|`0x80072EE2`|Network connectivity issue or issue talking to a configured WSUS server. Check WSUS settings and make sure it is accessible from the client.|
|`The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070422)`     | Make sure the Windows Update service (wuauserv) is running and is not disabled.        |
|Any other generic exception     | Do a search the internet for the possible solutions and work with your local IT support.         |

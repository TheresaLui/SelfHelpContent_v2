# The runbook failed because Azure Rm and Azure Az runbooks were executed in the same sandbox.

<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that your runbook, <!--$FailedRunbookName-->[Runbook Name]<!--/$FailedRunbookName-->, failed <!--$NumberOfFailures-->[Number of Failed Jobs]<!--/$NumberOfFailures--> times in the <!--$TimeRange-->[Time Range]<!--/$TimeRange--> days prior to support case creation. The most likely cause of the failure is that runbooks containing Azure Az cmdlets and runbooks containing Azure Rm cmdlets were executed in the same sandbox execution environment.

The most recent failure of <!--$FailedRunbookName-->[Failed Runbook Name]<!--/$FailedRunbookName--> is job Id, <!--$JobId-->[job Id]<!--/$JobId-->.

The jobs that were executed in the same sandbox as the most recent failure of <!--$FailedRunbookName-->[Failed Runbook Name]<!--/$FailedRunbookName--> are in the following table.

<!--$SandboxRunbooks-->[Sandbox Table]<!--/$SandboxRunbooks-->

## **Recommended Steps**

This type of failure can occur if the Azure Automation account contains both runbooks written to use Azure Rm cmdlets and runbooks written to use Azure Az cmdlets. Our recommendation is to upgrade all of the runbooks in the Azure Automation account to use Azure Az cmdlets. If you are in the process of converting your runbooks to use Azure Az cmdlets, the safe practice is to create another Azure Automation account which will contain the upgraded runbooks that are using the Azure Az cmdlets. This will keep one account with all Azure Rm runbooks and the other with all Azure Az runbooks.

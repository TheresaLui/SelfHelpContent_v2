# There are Runbook jobs failing and a recent update of Modules may be the cause
<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected runbook failures occurring after an update of module versions. Module updates can contain breaking changes, resulting in scripts behaving unexpectedly. We recommend maintaining a separate automation account to test module updates before deploying them to production.
<!--issueDescription-->

The following is a list of the Runbook failures we have detected in your Automation Account:

## **Recommended Steps**

* Azure PowerShell modules are updated frequently to include fixes and improvements and it is a good practice to stay current when possible
* If you are experiencing problems with a particular module, you can try [upgrading only that module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-azure-modules#considerations) to the latest Azure PowerShell to correct your problem
* **NOTE**: If the change in the modules would result in a major version upgrade (such as from 3.x to 4.x or 5.x to 6.x), you would need to be aware that these major version updates include breaking changes. These changes can be to the way that cmdlets work which may result in broken scripts until they are adapted to use the changes that have been introduced.
* Carefully review the breaking changes guidance for the version of the modules, such as for [major version 6.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/blob/preview/documentation/migration-guides/migration-guide.6.0.0.md), to determine if you need to update any of your runbook scripts to accommodate changes in the cmdlets they call. Each major update has its own upgrade guidance. You would need to review all the guides for the version you are upgrading from before you make any changes.
* Roll back to a previous module version by navigating to the "Modules" page under your Automation Account, selecting modules that have been recently updated, and choosing "Delete"
* [Re-import a previous version of the module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/shared-resources/modules#import-modules)

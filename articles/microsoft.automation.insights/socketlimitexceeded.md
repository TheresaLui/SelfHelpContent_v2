# Runbook was suspended because it exceeded the open socket limit
## **The runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, was suspended after exceeding the <!--$SocketLimit-->[SocketLimit]<!--/$SocketLimit--> open socket limit**
We have investigated and identified that your runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, was suspended <!--$FailedJobs-->[FailedJobs]<!--/$FailedJobs--> times in the <!--$TimeRange-->[TimeRange]<!--/$TimeRange--> days prior to case creation. It exceeded the <!--$SocketLimit-->[SocketLimit]<!--/$SocketLimit--> open socket limit.
### Recommended Steps
To avoid runbook failures caused by exceeding the <!--$SocketLimit-->[SocketLimit]<!--/$SocketLimit--> open socket limit, please refer to the following information for methods to solve this problem:

#### 1) Implement the recommendations in the [Socket Limit troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#job-attempted-3-times) including:

- Execute the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker). Hybrid workers do not impose a socket limit.

#### 2) Another technique to solve this problem is to:

- Modify the runbook to release socket connections, and connection pools as soon as possible. This will keep the number of open sockets to a minimum. [Sysinternals TCPView](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview), to monitor socket usage, is a valuable tool when debugging the PowerShell cmdlets to reduce socket consumption on a local PowerShell IDE.

#### 3) Optimize the runbook
Another option is to optimize the runbook.

One optimization option is to create child runbooks. If your runbook loops through the same function on a number of resources, such as a database operation on several databases, you can move that function to a [child runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-child-runbooks). Each of these child runbooks executes in parallel in separate processes decreasing the total number of sockets necessary for each runbook.

The PowerShell cmdlets that enable this scenario are:

- [Start-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/start-azurermautomationrunbook) This cmdlet allows you to start a runbook and pass parameters to the runbook
- [Get-AzureRmAutomationJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/Get-AzureRmAutomationJob) This cmdlet allows you to check the job status for each child if there are operations that need to be performed after the child runbook completes.

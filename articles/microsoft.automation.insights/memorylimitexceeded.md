# Runbook failed because it exceeded the memory limit

<!--/issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that your runbook, <!--$RunbookName-->[RunbookName]<!--/$RunbookName-->, failed <!--$FailedJobs-->[FailedJobs]<!--/$FailedJobs--> times in the <!--$TimeRange-->[TimeRange]<!--/$TimeRange--> days prior to case creation. It exceeded the <!--$MemoryLimit-->[MemoryLimit]<!--/$MemoryLimit--> Mbyte memory limit.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

To avoid runbook failures caused by exceeding the <!--$MemoryLimit-->[MemoryLimit]<!--/$MemoryLimit--> Mbyte memory limit, please refer to the following information for methods to solve this problem:

1. Implement the recommendations in the [Memory Limit troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#job-attempted-3-times)
2. Execute the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker). The memory on hybrid workers is limited only by the amount of memory on the machine that is hosting the hybrid worker, and this is typically much larger than the memory limit for Automation sandboxes.
3. Optimize the runbook by starting child runbooks from the parent runbook. If your runbook loops through the same function on a number of resources, such as a database operation on several databases, you can move that function to a [child runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-child-runbooks#starting-a-child-runbook-using-cmdlet). Each of these child runbooks will execute in parallel in separate processes, and thereby decrease the total amount of time for the parent runbook to complete. The PowerShell cmdlets that enable this scenario are:

  - [Start-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/start-azurermautomationrunbook) This cmdlet allows you to start a runbook and pass parameters to the runbook.
  - [Get-AzureRmAutomationJob](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/Get-AzureRmAutomationJob) This cmdlet allows you to check the job status for each child if there are operations that need to be performed after the child runbook completes.

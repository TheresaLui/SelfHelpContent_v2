# U-SQL jobs failing

U-SQL jobs can fail for a number of reasons.  Common reasons include: 

* Transient outages of the services such as DNS, Networking, ADLS that ADLA depends on
* Changes to the ACLs of the ADLS files consumed in the job
* Changing data size may cause data skew or storage throttling
* Changing data-distribution across partitions may cause errors or unoptimized execution of U-SQL jobs
* Improvements to the U-SQL compiler and optimizer may cause existing optimizer hints to become outdated 
* Note that U-SQL jobs that fail with error type "SYSTEM" are not charged 


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check if there are outages in the region where this job is running on [Azure status page](https://status.azure.com/status)<br>
2. Understand the error that caused the job to fail by using the Job Browser in Visual Studio or the the Job management tab for the ADLA account in the Azure Portal<br>

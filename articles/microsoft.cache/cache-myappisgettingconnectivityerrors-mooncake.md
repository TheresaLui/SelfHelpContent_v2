# My app is getting connectivity errors

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following methods.

1. Use recommended client configuration for your platform.<br>
[List of recommended Redis clients by language](http://redis.io/clients)
2. Check if you are exceeding the maximum number of client connections.<br>
[Learn about limits for number of client connections](https://docs.azure.cn/redis-cache/cache-faq#what-redis-cache-offering-and-size-should-i-use)
3. If hosted on Azure Virtual Network (VNet), check the ports are not blocked.<br>
[Common misconfiguration issues with Redis Cache and VNet](https://docs.azure.cn/redis-cache/cache-how-to-premium-vnet#what-are-some-common-misconfiguration-issues-with-azure-redis-cache-and-vnets)
4. Were you scaling out your client app? While scaling out there can be momentarily loss of connectivity. The clients should reconnect after the scale operation has finished.

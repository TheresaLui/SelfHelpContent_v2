# Planned Maintenance in virtual machine scale sets

**I don't see any indication of planned maintenance in the portal, PowerShell, or CLI**<br>

Azure conducts planned maintenance on virtual machine scale sets. To maintain the host infrastructure, Azure uses in-place migration to apply updates across fault domains. VMs in the scale sets are paused while their hosts are updated. No notifications are sent for these operations.<br>

To maintain the VM instances within the scale sets, planned maintenance is scheduled in waves. A wave starts with a notification to a subscription owner and co-owners. This notification defines a schedule with two time windows:<br>

- **Self-service window**<br>
- **Scheduled maintenance window**<br>

The self-service window is when you can proactively start self-service maintenance. Be aware that self-service maintenance might not be available for all your VMs, and is also not recommended for VMs in availability sets.<br>

After the self-service window ends, Azure schedules a time in the scheduled maintenance window to apply the required maintenance to your VM (provided the work has not been already performed by self-service).<br>

If you don't see notifications, it could due to of the following reasons:<br>

- The maintenance wave is finished<br>
- The maintenance wave has not started<br>
- The VM is hosted on an updated server<br>
- The VM is deployed to a region where planned maintenance is already scheduled<br>

- Notifications and alerts about planned maintenance<br>
- Schedules for the planned maintenance and self-service windows<br>
- VM scale sets affected by the planned maintenance<br>
- Instructions and guidelines for using  self-service maintenance<br>

# I'm experiencing performance issues

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve most common issues, try one or more of the following steps:

1. [Enable server performance logs](https://docs.azure.cn/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics/) to check latency and throughput performance
2. [Check throughput limits](https://docs.azure.cn/application-gateway/application-gateway-introduction/) to ensure that throughput is within acceptable limits
3. Increase Application Gateway size or number of instances. If latency or throughput is higher than expected, consider increasing size of Application Gateway or the number of instances.

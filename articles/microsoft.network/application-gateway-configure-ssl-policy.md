# Configure SSL policy

## **Recommended Steps**

With Application Gateway, you can either set predefined SSL policies with a minimum TLS version and a set of cipher suites pre-selected or you can set your own custom policy with a minimum TLS version and cipher suites of your choice.

To configure SSL policies, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Listeners** tab of your Application Gateway in the Azure portal.
2. Under the **SSL policy** section, select **change** option.
3. You can choose from one of the predefined policies or choose a custom policy.
4. Select **Save**.

Once your custom SSL policy is saved, it'll be common to all your listeners and you can manage it directly from the portal.

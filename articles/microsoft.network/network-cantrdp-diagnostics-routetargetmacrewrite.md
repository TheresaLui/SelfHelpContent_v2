<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified a routing issue which is preventing you from being able to remote into your VM, <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that this <!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection--> traffic is <!--$StatelessAction-->[StatelessAction]<!--/$StatelessAction--> traffic at the routing layer using a default rule. If the routing result is not desired, view the Effective routes to determine which tunnel is advertising a CIDR prefix covering this source IP address. Tunnels may include: VPN tunnels, VNet Peering, VNet Service Tunneling, or Forced Tunneling (Default Route) configuration.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. From a browser, navigate to http://portal.azure.com and, if necessary, sign in with your Azure account
2. Click Browse > Network Interface
3. Select the Network Interface of your VM
4. Click on the *Effective routes* blade
5. Modify the appropriate rule which is likely due to setting the destination IP address as an address in the Virtual Network

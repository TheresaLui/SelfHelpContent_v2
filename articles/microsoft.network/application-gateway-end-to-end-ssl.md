# End-to-end SSL issues with Application Gateway

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are observing issues with End-to-end SSL encryption with Application Gateway, verify that:

1. **Protocol is HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is the protocol in both **listener** and **HTTP Settings** to enable end-to-end SSL
2. **Backend is known**: Application gateway only communicates with trusted backend instances in case of encrypted communication. A backend is trusted by default, if it is a trusted Azure service such as Azure app service, Azure API Management, etc., or the root certificate of the backend instance's certificate is from a well known CA. For other backend types, verify that you have explicitly added a certificate (trusted root certificate for V2 SKU and authentication certificate for V1 SKU) on the Application Gateway to [whitelist the backend](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/end-to-end-ssl-portal#whitelist-certificates-for-backend-servers-1).

# Traffic is blocked by Network Security Group and altered by User-defined route tables

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified a problem that prevents network traffic flowing from a sample public IP address <!--$SourceIp-->SourceIp<!--/$SourceIp--> to the **<!--$VmName-->VmName<!--/$VmName-->** virtual machine on port **<!--$DestinationPort-->DestinationPort<!--/$DestinationPort-->**. Our diagnostics detected that both of the following conditions exist:<br>

. Network security group **"<!--$DestinationNsgName-->DestinationNsgName<!--/$DestinationNsgName-->"** has rule **"<!--$SecurityRuleName-->SecurityRuleName<!--/$SecurityRuleName-->"** that is causing this issue.<br>
. User-defined route tables have a route that is causing this issue.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

. To resolve the issue that is caused by the network security group, remove the **<!--$DestinationNsgName-->DestinationNsgName<!--/$DestinationNsgName-->** network security group to allow network traffic to flow from public IP address(es) to the virtual machine **<!--$VmName-->VmName<!--/$VmName-->** on port **<!--$DestinationPort-->DestinationPort<!--/$DestinationPort-->**. Or, you can create an INBOUND basic rule that has a higher priority (lower number) than the existing rules that specify port **<!--$DestinationPort-->DestinationPort<!--/$DestinationPort-->**.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and browse to the [Network Security Group blade](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FNetworkSecurityGroups).
2. Open your **<!--$DestinationNsgName-->DestinationNsgName<!--/$DestinationNsgName-->** network security group.
3. Add an **Allow** rule for public IP address(es) (for example, <!--$SourceIp-->SourceIp<!--/$SourceIp-->) that has a lower number (higher priority) than the Block rule **<!--$SecurityRuleName-->SecurityRuleName<!--/$SecurityRuleName-->**.
4. Save the changes, and check the traffic status again.

. To resolve the routing issue with user-defined route tables, examine the [User-defined route tables]( https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FrouteTables) to make sure that the routing is set up correctly. You can try to [dissociate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-route-table#dissociate-a-route-table-from-a-subnet) questionable [User-defined route tables](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FrouteTables) from the affected subnet to determine whether that resolves the issue.

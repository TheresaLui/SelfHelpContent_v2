# ADFS and SharePoint connections fail behind load balancer over VPN

## **Recommended steps**
1.	Adjust ADFS serversâ€™ Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to 1350 instead of relying on Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) as the Internal Load Balancer (ILB) doesn't support PMTUD pass-through.
2.	Use a 3rd party network appliance for load balancing (available in Azure portal).
3.	Use an External Load Balancer (ELB/ SLB) instead of the ILB to move this traffic out of the VPN, hence not hitting the MTU restriction.

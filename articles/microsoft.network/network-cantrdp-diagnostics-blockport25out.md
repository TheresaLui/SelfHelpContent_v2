<!--issueDescription-->
Starting on Nov. 15, 2017, all new PAYG/MPN subscriptions will have port 25 blocked for all deployments in the subscription. For Pay-As-You-Go or Microsoft Partner Network subscriptions created after November 15, 2017, there will be technical restrictions blocking e-mail sent directly from VMs in these subscriptions on TCP port 25.  Pay-As-You-Go or Microsoft Partner Network customers that need the ability to send e-mail from Azure VMs directly to external e-mail providers on port 25 (not using an authenticated SMTP relay) can make a request to remove the restriction.  Requests will be reviewed and approved at Microsoftâ€™s discretion and will be only granted after additional anti-fraud checks are performed.

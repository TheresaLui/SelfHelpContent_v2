# Traffic Manager is directing requests to disabled endpoint

## **Recommended steps**

1. Cached response might be the reason for directing requests to disabled endpoint. Setting Time to Live (TTL) to a lower value may resolve this issue. A lower TTL lets cached entries expire faster but this may result in more requests to the Traffic Manager service.<br>
   The default TTL value is 60 seconds which can be set to a minimum of 0 seconds.

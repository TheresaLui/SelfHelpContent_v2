# I can't connect to my secondary NIC

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve most common issues, try one or more of the following methods:

1. Make sure you have successfully added multiple Network Interface Controllers (NICs) to your VM:

    * [Create a VM (Classic/RDFE) with multiple NICs](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-network-deploy-multinic-classic-ps)
    * [View network interfaces for a VM](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface-vm#vm-view-nic)

2. Azure does not assign a default gateway to additional (secondary) network interfaces attached to a virtual machine. By default, you are unable to communicate with resources outside the subnet that a secondary network interface is in. Secondary network interfaces can, however, communicate with resources outside their subnet. To enable communication, follow the steps outlined below for the appropriate operating system: 

    * [Windows](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface-vm#routing-within-a-virtual-machine-operating-system-with-multiple-network-interfaces)
    * [Linux](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-machines/linux/multiple-nics#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics)<br>

# I cannot connect to my public endpoint after associating NSG to my virtual machine.

## **Recommended steps**
NSGs by default deny connections from Internet unless it is explicitly allowed. To resolve this issue, try one or more of the below steps.<br>

1. Review the security rules in your NSG.<br>
2. Check if the backend port used in the load balancer rule configuration is in the allow list.<br>
3. If there is no rule to allow the traffic from Internet, add a new rule to allow access to backend port, with source being 'Internet', '*' or a specific public IP address.<br>

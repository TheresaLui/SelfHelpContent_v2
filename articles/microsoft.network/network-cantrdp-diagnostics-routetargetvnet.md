# We ran connectivity diagnostics on your resource and found an issue.

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified a routing issue which is preventing you from being able to remote into your VM, <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that this <!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection--> traffic is <!--$StatelessAction-->[StatelessAction]<!--/$StatelessAction--> to route within the local Virtual Network. If this routing result is not desired, you can modify this behavior.

## View and adjust Effective Security Rules
1. From a browser, navigate to http://portal.azure.com and, if necessary, sign in with your Azure account.
2. Click Browse > Network Interface.
3. Select the Network Interface of your VM
4. Click on the *Effective routes* blade
5. Modify the appropriate rule which is likely due to setting the destination IP address as an address in the Virtual Network.

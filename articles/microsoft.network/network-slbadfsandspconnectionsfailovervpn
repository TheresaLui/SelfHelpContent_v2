# ADFS & SharePoint connections fail behind Load Balancer over VPN

## **Recommended steps**
1.	Adjust ADFS serversâ€™ MTU to 1350 instead of relying on PMTUD as the ILB does not support ICMP. 
2.	Use DNS load balancing.
3.	Use Application Gateway instead of ILB.
4.	Use a 3rd party network appliance available in Azure marketplace.
5.	Use a VIP instead of the ILB to move this traffic out of the VPN, hence not hitting the MTU restriction.

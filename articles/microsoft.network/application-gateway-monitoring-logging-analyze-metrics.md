# Azure monitoring and logging - analyze metrics

**Application Gateway** publishes data points, called **metrics**, to [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview) for the performance of your Application Gateway and back-end servers.

Metrics are published in 60-second intervals and are, by default, enabled for your Application Gateway. You can view the metrics directly from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), or you can stream the values as logs to your storage account, log analytics, or event hub.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not able to see the logs or metrics of your Application Gateway when they are enabled, check whether you have any network security groups (NSGs) or user-defined routes (UDR) on the Application Gateway subnet. NSGs and UDRs can block internet access. You can learn more about NSG and UDR requirements for Application Gateway at [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure).

## **Recommended Steps**

To analyze metrics, please follow these recommended steps:

1. Navigate to the metrics blade of your Application Gateway.

2. You can limit the scope to a single Application Gateway, or you can extend it to multiple gateways to analyze them at the same time.

3. Select the metric that you want to view, the type of chart and you can choose the time range and the granularity as well.

4. You can apply splitting to metric based on the supported dimensions to get a more filtered view of the data.

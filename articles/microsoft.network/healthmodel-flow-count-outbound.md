# We found an issue with the network interface on this VM
<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your VM, **<!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->**.  High outbound connection/flow count may result in degraded performance.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

The most likely cause of high outbound connections/flows is a customer application or service within the VM.   

* Consider changing your application or service to reduce the number of connections on this network interface
* Consider enabling Accelerated Networking on the network interface
* Consider adding additional network interfaces to the VM to handle the connection volume
* Consider adding additional VMs to handle the connection volume
* To determine the nature of the traffic, login to the VM and display the destination IP addresses of active connections (use command 'netstat -an' (Windows) or 'netstat -l' (Linux))

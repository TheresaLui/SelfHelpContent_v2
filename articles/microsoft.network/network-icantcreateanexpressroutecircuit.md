# I can't create an ExpressRoute circuit

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following methods.

1. Review [Audit logs](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Insights.AzureDiagnosticsBladeWithParameter) to determine the reason of failure.
2. Check if you are hitting the subscription limits and if it is the reason for not able to create the circuit.<br>
[Check default subscription limits for ExpressRoute resources.](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/#networking-limits)
3. Check your subscription permissions to make sure you're allowed to create resources in the region you want the ExpressRoute circuit.

# We ran connectivity diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
Routing ALLOWS this <!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection--> traffic when the source is NOT the Internet for CIDR prefixes advertised across a VPN tunnel, across an ExpressRoute Private peering, or CIDR prefixes used locally in the VNet or peered VNet.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

If the routing result is not desired, view the Effective Route Table to determine which tunnel is advertising a CIDR prefix covering this source IP address. Tunnels may include: VPN tunnels, ExpressRoute Private peering, VNet Peering, VNet Service Endpoints, or Forced Tunneling (Default Route) configuration.

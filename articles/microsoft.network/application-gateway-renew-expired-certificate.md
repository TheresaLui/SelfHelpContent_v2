# Renew expired certificate

## **Recommended Steps**

You can renew SSL certificates in Application Gateway using the **renew** option in the Azure portal. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the listener where you have the expired or soon-to-be expired certificate.
2. Select the **Renew or edit the selected certificate** option.
3. In the choose certificate option, you can choose between uploading a renewed certificate or choose a certificate from your Key Vault.
4. Select **Save** once done.

You can also achieve the same using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. For information, see [Renew Application Gateway certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/renew-certificates).

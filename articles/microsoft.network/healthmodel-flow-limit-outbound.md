# We found an issue with the network interface on this VM
<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your VM, **<!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->**.  Some outbound connections are being dropped due to 500K flow limit exceeded on the network interface.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

The most likely cause of excessive outbound connections/flows is a customer application or service within the VM.   

* Login to the VM and display the destination IP addresses of active connections (use command 'netstat -an' (Windows) or 'netstat -l' (Linux)).
* Configure your application or service to reduce the number of outbound connections or add additional network interfaces to the VM or add additional VMs.

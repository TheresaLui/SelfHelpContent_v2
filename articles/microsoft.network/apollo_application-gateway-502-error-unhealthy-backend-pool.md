# Unhealthy back-end pool
## Unhealthy back-end pool
:::Section Insights:::

When all of the servers in a back-end pool are unhealthy, Application Gateway has no healthy servers to forward client requests to. 

These issues can stem from the health probe configuration in Application Gateway or your back-end server, which fails to give a healthy response. In this case, the clients will receive a "502 Bad Gateway" error to signify that no active servers are available to accept the requests.

### Recommended Steps

To troubleshoot 502 Bad Gateway errors, open the **Backend health** blade and follow these steps:

1. In the **Backend health blade**, check the error message for an unhealthy server
2. Check the error message in the **Details** column
3. Visit [Back-end health troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#back-end-health) to learn about troubleshooting steps for each error message

Alternatively, you can check the detailed error message by using Azure PowerShell, CLI, or REST API. For more information, see [Back-end health and diagnostic logs for Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#back-end-health).

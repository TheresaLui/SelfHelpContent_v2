# We ran connectivity diagnostics on your resource and found an issue.

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified a routing issue which is preventing you from being able to remote into your VM, <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that this <!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection--> traffic is <!--$StatelessAction-->[StatelessAction]<!--/$StatelessAction--> by Virtual Network Service Endpoint (the traffic stays on the Microsoft Azure backbone network). If you do not want traffic to be sent directly to the Azure Service Endpoint, deselect the Azure service from the Virtual Network Subnet as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-configure)

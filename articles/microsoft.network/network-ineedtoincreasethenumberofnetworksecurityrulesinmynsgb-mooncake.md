# I need to increase the number of Network Security rules in my NSG.

## **Recommended Steps**

Default limit on the number of NSG rules is 200. This can be raised to 400 (Classic) or 500 (Azure Resource Manager) via a support ticket. If you need to increase the number of security rules in your NSG, follow these steps: 

1. Create a [New Support Request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade)
2. Select the Issue type as "Quota"
3. Select the Quota type as "Networking: Classic" (or Networking: ARM), and enter details of the NSG in details field

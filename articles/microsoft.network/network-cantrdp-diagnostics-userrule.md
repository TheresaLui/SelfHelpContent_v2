# We ran connectivity diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified an issue which is preventing you from being able to remote into your VM, <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->. We identified that this <!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection--> traffic is <!--$StatefulAction-->[StatefulAction]<!--/$StatefulAction--> by security rule: <!--$RuleNameWithUserRule_RemovedFromBeginning-->[RuleNameWithUserRule_RemovedFromBeginning]<!--/$RuleNameWithUserRule_RemovedFromBeginning-->.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

If the security rules result is not desired, view the [Effective Security Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-nsg-troubleshoot-portal) to view and modfiy the rule. If this traffic should be allowed, create a $TrafficDirection basic rule with a higher priority (lower number) than existing rules specifying port $port. If this traffic should not be allowed, create a $TrafficDirection advanced rule with a higher priority (lower number) than existing rules specifying the source and destination IPs desired, port $port, and action Deny.

1. From a browser, navigate to http://portal.azure.com and, if necessary, sign in with your Azure account
2. Click Browse > Network Security Groups
3. Select the Network Interface of your VM
4. Click on the *Effective routes* blade
5. Modify the appropriate rule which is likely due to setting the destination IP address as an address in the Virtual Network

# I need to increase the number of Network Security Groups in my subscription.

## **Recommended Steps**

Default limit on the number of NSGs in a subscription is 100. This can be increased to 200 (classic) or 400 (Azure Resource Manager) via a support ticket. If you need to increase the number of NSGs in your subscription, follow these steps:

1. Create a [New Support Request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade)
2. Select the Issue type as "Quota"
3. Select the Quota type as "Networking: Classic" (or Networking: ARM), and enter details of the NSG in details field

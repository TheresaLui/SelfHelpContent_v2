# I am unable to connect to virtual machines in the same VNet when using an UDR.

## **Recommended steps**

If you are using User defined routes in your virtual network subnets and have connectivity issues, try one or more of the below steps to resolve the issue.<br>

1. Check the route entries to ensure the destination address you are having issues with is covered by one or more routes. Communication within the Virtual network, to on-premises and to Internet is covered by system routes.<br>
[User defined routes overview](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview/)
2. Check that the destination is reachable from other sources.<br>
3. Check that the Network security group rules on both source and destination allow this traffic.<br>
4. If you are using a NVA to route the traffic through, check that the NVA VM is running and 'IP Forwarding' is enabled.<br>
5. Check to validate that NVA is not in the same subnet as the source virtual machine. This will create a route loop.<br>

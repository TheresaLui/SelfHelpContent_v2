# I'm experiencing performance issues

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following methods.

1. Enable server performance logs to check latency and throughput performance. See below link for steps to enable performance logs.<br>
[Enable performance logs](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/application-gateway-diagnostics/)
2. Check throughput limits to ensure that throughput is within acceptable limits.<br>
[Check throughput guidance for application gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/application-gateway-introduction/)
3. Increase Application Gateway size or number of instances.<br>
If latency or throughput is higher than expected, consider increasing size of Application Gateway or the number of instances.

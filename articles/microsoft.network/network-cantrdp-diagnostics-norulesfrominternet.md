# We ran connectivity diagnostics on your resource and found an issue.

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft Azure has identified an issue which is preventing you from being able to remote into your VM, **<!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->**.
Access Control **<!--$action-->[action]<!--/$action-->**  this **<!--$TrafficDirection-->[TrafficDirection]<!--/$TrafficDirection-->** traffic because there are not any access control rules defined for internet routable IPs.
<!--/issueDescription-->

If the access control result is not desired, check to ensure the VM is associated with a [public IP address](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-arm-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) either directly on a NIC IPConfig, or as a member of a Azure Load Balancer backend address pool.

# Troubleshoot my Network Security Group (NSG)

Resolve issues with VM Network Security Group (NSG) by using the following steps.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**

NSGs by default will deny a connection from the Internet unless it is explicitly allowed. To resolve this issue, try one or more of the following steps:

Try using [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to connect to your VM.  [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) provides secure and seamless RDP connectivity to your virtual machine directly in the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machine does not need a public IP address, or inbound NSG rule allowing RDP traffic.

1. Use [IP flow verify](button-data-blade:microsoft_azure_network.verifyipflowblade.id.$subscriptionId) to confirm if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking traffic to or from a virtual machine
2. Edit the [Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group) to make changes to the rules if needed
3. If there is no rule to allow remote RDP traffic, review [Unable to connect via RDP due to NSG](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-rdp-nsg-problem)<br>
4. If there is no rule to allow the traffic from Internet, add a new rule to allow access to the backend port, with source being `Internet`, `\*` or a specific public IP address

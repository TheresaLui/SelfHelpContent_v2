## **Recommended Documents**

Try using [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to connect to your VM.  [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) provides secure and seamless RDP connectivity to your virtual machine directly in the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machine does not need a public IP address, or inbound NSG rule allowing RDP traffic.

* [Guidelines on how to create, change or delete a public IP address prefix](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-public-ip-address-prefix)

Use *IP flow verify* to confirm if a rule in a Network Security Group or user defined route is blocking traffic to or from a virtual machine:

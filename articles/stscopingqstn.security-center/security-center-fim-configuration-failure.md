#  Azure Security Center File Integrity monitor Configuration failure

File Integrity Monitor uses the Microsoft Azure Change Tracking solution to track and identify changes in your environment. When File Integrity Monitoring is enabled, a Change Tracking resource (Log Analytics workspace) is created in your subscription. If you remove this Change Tracking resource, the File Integrity Monitoring feature is disabled.

To resolve the configuration failure, you have to open the relevant Log Analytics workspace, and check the Solution section to see whether the following solutions are presented:

- Security
- Change tracking

If one of these two solutions are not enabled on the workspace solution list, go to **Security Center - File Integrity Monitoring**, and press upgrade and enable.

## **Tips for troubleshooting**

- File Integrity monitor works only on Azure virtual machines (VMs) and on-premises VMs.
- The server must be monitored by Azure Security Center, and the Azure Log Analytics agent must be shown as healthy.
- Azure security center has to be on Standard mode on the subscription level, and every User workspace that the user wants should also be in Standard mode (that is, a security solution be should installed on it).
- File Integrity Monitor does not work for the PaaS services.
- The File Integrity Monitor UI in Azure portal shows only the last 100 changes. You should always run a log analytics query to check whether the changes appear in the user workspace.

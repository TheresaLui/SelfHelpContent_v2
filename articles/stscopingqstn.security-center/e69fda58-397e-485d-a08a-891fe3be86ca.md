# Azure Security Center recommendations self-help guide

## Security recommendations

### How can I manage the recommendations?
Azure Security Center (ASC) makes its security recommendations based on your chosen policies. ASC policies are based on policy initiatives created in Azure Policy. To view and manage security policies, see [Manage your security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#manage-your-security-policies).

### How can I disable a recommendation?
When a recommendation is irrelevant for your environment, you can prevent that recommendation from appearing again. For instructions, see [Disable security policies and disable recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies-and-disable-recommendations).

### Why canâ€™t I see a recommendation in the **Recommendation** blade?

No recommendation is shown if the recommendation was disabled in Azure Policy. To learn more, see [isable security policies and disable recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies-and-disable-recommendations).

### When I remediate a resource, why is the change not reflected in the portal?

If you followed the [**Remediation steps**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations#remediation-steps) or the [**Quick fix remediation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations#quick-fix-remediation) and the resource still shows as unhealthy, this issue can be caused by one of the following factors:

- The Recommendations did not refresh. The Recommendations freshness time is presented on the recommendation page. Make sure that this time has passed.
- The Security Center did not receive the new data from the Log Analytics Monitoring agent in the VM
- Your Azure Policy custom initiative contains a policy that contradicts the default built-in security policy

### Can I exempt a single resource from Security Center recommendations?
Yes. We call it a Resource exemption.  
Resource exemptions give you the ability to fine-tune recommendations, which includes exempting specific resources from evaluation.  
To exempt a resource, select the **Recommendation** ellipsis on the right and select **Create exemption**. For more details, see [Resource exemption in Azure Security Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/resource-exemption-in-azure-security-center/ba-p/1703052), also in Security Center [public Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/exempt-resource).


### Discrepancies between security recommendations and security policies
Azure security recommendations are based on Azure Policy. For a list of recommendations and their related policies, see [Recommendations reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/recommendations-reference).

In some cases, you may see discrepancies between Azure Policy and Security Center recommendations:
- Many recommendations are mapped many to one. In other words, more than one recommendation is mapped to a single policy.
- ASC has 3 states for a recommendation: **Unhealthy**, **Healthy**, and **Not applicable resources**, while Azure Policy has only 2: **Compliant** and **Non-compliant**.  
ASC maps **Not applicable resources** recommendations to the **Unhealthy** policy state.
- Policy insights paging limitation on large number of resources
- On some recommendations, ASC may employ further analysis on a resource and conclude a different state of compliance based on its internal heuristics


## Troubleshoot a recommendation remediation

1. Azure Security Center uses Azure Policy as its main policy engine. To view the recommendation status in the Azure Policy compliance center, do the followign:
   - Review the [recommendations reference guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/recommendations-reference) and find the related policy
   - Go to **Azure Policy Portal** > **Compliance** > **Azure security center default assignment**. (ASC defaults to (subscription: **\<subId\>**)
   -  Search for the relevant policy
   -  Validate the resource to determine if it's compliant
2. Determine if the VM Log Analytics Monitor agent is running, in a Healthy state, and sending a valid heartbeat.  
   Read more about [Log Analytics agent in ASC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/faq-data-collection-agents#what-is-the-log-analytics-agent).
3. [View and remediate findings from vulnerability assessment solutions on your VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/remediate-vulnerability- findings-vm)
4. Verify the **Recommendation** in the [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/) using this query:
   ```
   securityresources
   | where type == "microsoft.security/assessments"
   ```
   The above `ARG` output should reflect your recommendations as they appear in the portal. Any discrepancy may indicate on a problem. Make sure to add it to your support request.

## Recommendations API
- In the REST API, Recommendations are referred to as Assessments. The available actions include: `Create Or Update`, `Get`, `List`, and `Delete`. See [Assessments](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/assessments).
- SubAssessments (also referred to as Nested Recommendations) are the findings of the Vulnerabilities Assessments tools and the Security Configurations scanner. See [SubAssessments API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/subassessments).

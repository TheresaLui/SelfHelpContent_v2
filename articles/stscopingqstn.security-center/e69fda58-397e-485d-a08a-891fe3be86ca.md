# Azure Security Center Recommendations self-help guide

## Security Recommendations

### How can I manage the recommendations?
Azure Security Center makes its security recommendations based on your chosen policies. Security Center policies are based on policy initiatives created in Azure Policy. To view and manage the security policies follow the information here: [Manage your security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#manage-your-security-policies)

### How can I disable a recommendation?
When a recommendation is irrelevant for your environment, you can prevent that recommendation from appearing again. Follow the instructions here: [Disable security policies and disable recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies-and-disable-recommendations)

### Why I can’t see a recommendation in the recommendation blade?

A given recommendation will be not be shown if the recommendation was disabled in Azure policy, learn more here: [isable security policies and disable recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies-and-disable-recommendations)

### Why I have remediated a resource, but the change is not reflected in the portal?

If you have followed the [**Remediation steps**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations#remediation-steps) or the [**Quick Fix remediation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations#quick-fix-remediation) and the resource is still showing as unhealthy, this issue can be caused by one of the following factors:

- The Recommendations is not refreshed. The Recommendations freshness time is presented on the recommendation page, make sure this time has passed
- The security Center has not received the new data from the Log Analytics Monitoring agent in the VM
- You have Azure Policy custom initiative containing a policy contradicting the default built-in security policy

### Can I exempt a single resource from Security Center Recommendations?
Yes. We call it Resource exemption.  
Resource exemption will allow increased granularity for you to fine-tune recommendations by providing the ability to exempt certain resources from evaluation.  
To exempt a resource simply click on the Recommendation ellipsis menu on the right side and then select **create exemption**. Check out this blog post to learn how [Resource exemption in Azure Security Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/resource-exemption-in-azure-security-center/ba-p/1703052), also in Security Center [public Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/exempt-resource ).


### Discrepancies between Security Recommendations and Security Policies
Azure security recommendations are based on Azure policy. You can find the list of recommendations and their related policies here: [Recommendations reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/recommendations-reference)

In some cases you may see discrepancies between Azure Policy and Security Center Recommendations:
- Many recommendations are mapped many to one – meaning more than one recommendation is mapped to a single policy
- ASC have 3 states for a recommendations: Unhealthy, Healthy and Not applicable resources, while policy have only 2: Compliant and Non-compliant.  
ASC maps the "Not applicable resources" to the "unhealthy" policy state
- Policy insights paging limitation on large number of resources
- On some recommendations ASC may employ further analysis on a resource which may conclude different state of compliance base on its internal heuristics


## Troubleshooting Recommendation Remediation

1. Azure Security Center uses Azure policy as its main policy engine. Check the recommendation status in Azure Policy compliance center, to do so please:
- Check the [recommendations reference guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/recommendations-reference) and find the related policy
- Go to Azure Policy Portal -> Compliance -> Azure security center default assignment (ASC Default (subscription: \<subId\>)
-  Search for the relevant policy
-  Validate if the resource is compliance or not
2. Check that the VM Log Analytics Monitor agent is running and healthy and sending valid heartbeat.  
Read more about [Log Analytics agent in ASC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/faq-data-collection-agents#what-is-the-log-analytics-agent).
3. [View and remediate findings from vulnerability assessment solutions on your VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm)
4. Check the Recommendation in [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/) using this query:
   ```
   securityresources
   | where type == "microsoft.security/assessments"
   ```
The above ARG output should reflect your recommendations as it appear in the portal. Any discrepancy may indicate on a problem. Please add it to your support request.

## Recommendations API
- In API Recommendations referred as Assessments. You have these actions available in REST API: Create Or Update, Get, List, Delete.  
More details here: https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/assessments
- SubAssessments also referred as Nested Recommendations are the findings of Vulnerabilities Assessments tools or Security Configurations scanner.  
SubAssessments API: https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/subassessments

# Vulnerability Assessment - Solutions (BYOL) self help guide

### My machine is not in the recommended list for enabling a vulnerability assessment solution
1.	Make sure the [vulnerability assessment policy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f501541f7-f7e7-4cd6-868c-4190fdad3ac9) is assigned to your subscription.
2.	Check to see if your machine is in the Not Applicable tab. If it is, there are several possible causes:
     a. It might be an unsupported resource type. See supported resources and operating systems in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm).
     b. If you see a message saying that the extension might be corrupted, try to remove or unlink the vulnerability assessment extension for this machine. Wait for it to be recommended for deployment and try to deploy it again.

### My machine fails for successfully deploy the vulnerability scanner
1.	Check the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#deploy-the-integrated-scanner-to-your-azure-and-hybrid-machines) to see if you are running a supported operating system 
2.	Make sure your machine is turned on. If this is an Azure Arc machine, make sure it is in a Connected state and not in an Offline state.
3.	Validate that you have Write permissions for the VM or Arc Machine.
4.	Make sure your machine has internet access to the vulnerability scanning platform. If you are using the Qualys scanner, see the network requirements in the [official documentation FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#what-prerequisites-and-permissions-are-required-to-install-the-qualys-extension).
5.	Check you have sufficient disk space: at least 512 MB RAM and 200 MB disk space.

### My machine doesn’t have vulnerability findings in the "Remediate vulnerabilities in your virtual machines" assessment
1.	Make sure your scanner is successfully deployed by ensuring that your machine has a Healthy status on the scanner provisioning assessment, "A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines." If that status isn't present, deploy a vulnerability scanner on your machine.
2.	Check the machine status on the findings assessment, **"Remediate vulnerabilities in your virtual machines"**.
    a.	If it has Healthy status – no vulnerabilities were found on that machine.
    b.	If it has Not Applicable status – check the reason column to get more details.  
	A common reason is "Findings have not been received yet for the VM", which is typical for new agent deployments. It may take up to 24 hours for the scanner vendor to register the new agent and complete a full first scan. However, after first the first scan is shown, subsequent scans are typically reflected in ASC minutes after being completed by the machine.

### The recommended option to deploy the Built-in vulnerability scanner is grayed out
The built-in vulnerability scanner requires Azure Defender for servers. 
To use this scanner - onboard your machines to Azure Defender for servers.

### I can see the vulnerability findings on Azure Security Center, but not on the Qualys platform
Qualys doesn’t store vulnerability findings data of the ASC built-in vulnerability scanner included in Azure Defender for servers.  
When using this scanner, you can analyze the vulnerability findings through Azure only. If you want to have programmatic access to your vulnerability findings, these resources might help:
-	Use continuous export to send vulnerability findings to Event Hub or Log Analytics Workspace: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/continuously-export-security-findings-from-vulnerability/ba-p/1640691
-	Query your vulnerability findings data using Azure Resource Graph: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/exporting-vulnerability-assessment-results-in-azure-security/ba-p/1212091

### I tried to manually install the extension via Compute API and failed
Installing the integrated vulnerability assessment scanners integrated with ASC should be done through ASC API.
-	If you are using the built-in vulnerability assessment scanner, see this blog post for all deployment as scale options - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/built-in-vulnerability-assessment-for-vms-in-azure-security/ba-p/1577947  

### My machine keeps appearing under N/A resources with the reason "extension might be corrupted" even though I removed and reinstalled it.
Make sure that the extension was not re-installed manually via Compute extensions API since Installing VA can only be established via ASC. 
-	If you are using the built-in vulnerability assessment scanner, see this blog post for all deployment as scale options - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/built-in-vulnerability-assessment-for-vms-in-azure-security/ba-p/1577947 

### I resolved my machine’s vulnerability findings, but I can still see them in ASC
It may take a few hours for the next vulnerability scan cycle to run and reflect the changes in ASC.

# Vulnerability Assessment - Built-In (Powered by Qualys) self help guide

### **My machine is not in the recommended list for enabling a vulnerability assessment solution**

- Make sure that the [vulnerability assessment policy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f501541f7-f7e7-4cd6-868c-4190fdad3ac9) is assigned to your subscription.
- Check to see if your machine is in the **Not Applicable** tab. If it is, the reason could explain why the machine is at that state:
    - It might be an unsupported resource type. See [supported resources and operating systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm).
    - If you see a message saying that the extension might be corrupted, try to remove or unlink the vulnerability assessment extension for this machine. Wait for it to be recommended for deployment, and then try to deploy it again.

### **My machine fails for deploying the vulnerability scanner**
- Check the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#deploy-the-integrated-scanner-to-your-azure-and-hybrid-machines) to see if you are running a supported operating system. 
- For VMs, make sure that you have the VM agent installed. See [VM agent Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) or [VM agent Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux).
- Make sure your machine is turned on. If this is an Azure Arc machine, make sure it's in a connected state and not offline.
- Check that you have Write permissions for the VM or Arc Machine.
- Make sure your machine has internet access to the vulnerability scanning platform. If you are using the Qualys scanner, see the [network requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#what-prerequisites-and-permissions-are-required-to-install-the-qualys-extension).
- Check you have sufficient disk space: at least 512 MB RAM and 200 MB disk space.


### **My machine doesn’t have vulnerability findings in the "Remediate vulnerabilities in your virtual machines" assessment**
- Make sure your scanner is successfully deployed by checking that your machine has a Healthy status on the scanner provisioning assessment, "A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines." If your machine doesn't have a Healthy status, deploy a vulnerability scanner on the machine.
- Check the machine status on the findings assessment, "Remediate vulnerabilities in your virtual machines".
    a.	If it has a Healthy status, no vulnerabilities were found on that machine.
    b.	If it has Not Applicable status, check the reason column for more details.  
	A common reason is "Findings have not been received yet for the VM," which is typical for new agent deployments. It may take up to 24 hours for the scanner vendor to register the new agent and complete a full first scan. However, after  the first scan is shown, subsequent scans are typically reflected in ASC after a few hours.

### **The recommended option to deploy the built-in vulnerability scanner is grayed out**
The built-in vulnerability scanner requires Azure Defender for servers. 
To use this scanner, onboard your machines to Azure Defender for servers.


### **I can see the vulnerability findings on Azure Security Center, but not on the Qualys platform**
Qualys doesn’t store vulnerability findings data of the ASC built-in vulnerability scanner included in Azure Defender for servers.  
When using this scanner, you can analyze the vulnerability findings through Azure only. If you want programmatic access to your vulnerability findings, these resources can help:
-	[Use continuous export to send vulnerability findings to Event Hub or Log Analytics Workspace](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/continuously-export-security-findings-from-vulnerability/ba-p/1640691)
-	[Query your vulnerability findings data by using Azure Resource Graph](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/exporting-vulnerability-assessment-results-in-azure-security/ba-p/1212091)

### **I tried to manually install the extension via Compute API, but it failed**
Installing the integrated vulnerability assessment scanners integrated with ASC should be done through ASC API.
-	If you're using the built-in vulnerability assessment scanner, see [this blog post for all deployment as scale options](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/built-in-vulnerability-assessment-for-vms-in-azure-security/ba-p/1577947)  

### **My machine keeps appearing under N/A resources with the reason "extension might be corrupted," even though I removed and reinstalled it**
- Make sure that the extension was not reinstalled manually via the Compute extensions API. Installing VA solutions in ASC can only be established via ASC. 
- If you're using the built-in vulnerability assessment scanner, see [this blog post for all deployment as scale options](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/built-in-vulnerability-assessment-for-vms-in-azure-security/ba-p/1577947) 

### **I resolved my machine’s vulnerability findings, but I can still see them in ASC**
- It may take a few hours for the next vulnerability scan cycle to run and reflect the changes in ASC.

### **I deployed the built-in extension on my VMs but can't find the new security solution**
- The built-in solution does not create a security solution in ASC. After deploying the built-in extension, it might take several hours for the first scan to arrive. Then, go to **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated** in order to see it.

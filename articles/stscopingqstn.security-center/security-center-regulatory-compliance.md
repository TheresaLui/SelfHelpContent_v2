# Azure Security Center Regulatory Compliance Common Solutions

To use the Regulatory Compliance, Azure Security Center must be on standard pricing tier on the subscription level. If the Regulatory Compliance UI is not loading correctly, try the following steps:

1. Clear browser cache.
2. Use a different browser.
3. Try to load it from different network location.

The compliance dashboard surfaces security assessments and recommendations as they align to specific compliance requirements. So if some recommendation result is not accurate, refer to the recommendation section for further analysis.

Azure Security Center periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Azure Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations.

A given recommendation can be disappear if 2 of this options occur :

	1. All the resources under this recommendation are healthy 
	2. The recommendation is disable by a security policy  

If after you have  followed the remediation steps, and the resource is still appearing as unhealthy, you should pay attention to the following :

	• Azure Security Center recommendation engine refresh time is :

		1. Recommendations refresh time is occur every 12 hr
		2.

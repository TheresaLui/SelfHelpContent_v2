# Security Alerts - Alert details are incorrect Common Solutions

## Alerts types

* Virtual Machine Behavioral Analysis (VMBA)<br>
* Network Analysis<br>
* SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse Analysis<br>
* Contextual Information

For VMBA alerts, the same Virtual Machine (VM) name appears in both the alert detail and the Azure portal. This name may be different from the host name of the VM.

Customers can share feedback for the alert description and relevance. Navigate to the alert itself, select the **Was This Useful** button, select the reason, and enter a comment to explain the feedback. We consistently monitor this feedback channel to improve our alerts.

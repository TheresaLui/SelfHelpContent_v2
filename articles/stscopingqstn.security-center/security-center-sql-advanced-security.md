# Azure Security Center Data and Storage SQL Common Solutions

SQL Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) provides a single go-to location for discovering, classifying and protecting sensitive data, managing your database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to the database. You can enable ATP on your entire database server, and apply it to all databases on the server.

SQL Vulnerability Assessment has some new and valuable capabilities:

- **Automated scheduled scans**. Configure SQL Vulnerability Assessment to automatically run a scan once a week and send you an email with a result summary.
- **Exportable report**. One click to create and download an Excel report of the complete assessment results.
- **Augmented rule set**. A broader set of checks covering both database and server-level vulnerabilities, which impact the overall security of the database system.
- **Scan history**. View a complete history of all scans run on a database, with an ability to drill down into the details of each historic scan result.

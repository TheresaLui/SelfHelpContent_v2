# Security Policy - Policy Settings - Auto Provisioning Common Solutions

To collect the data from the virtual machines install the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**. Installation of the agent can be done automatically (recommended) or you can choose to install the agent manually.

     **Note:** Automatic provisioning is off by default. To set **Security Center** to install automatic provisioning by default, change the setting from off to on.

When automatic provisioning is set to **on**, **Security Center** provisions the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** on all existing supported **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**, and any new ones that are created. Automatic provisioning is strongly recommended, but manual agent installation is also available. [Learn how to install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-enable-data-collection#manualagent).

Windows or Linux IaaS VMs qualify for automatic provisioning of the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent** installation if the following conditions apply:

* The Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension is not currently installed on the VM.
* The VM is in running state.
* The Windows or Linux [Azure Virtual Machine Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) is installed.
* The VM is not used as an appliance such as web application firewall or next generation firewall.

# JIT NSG Rules configuration

Just In Time (JIT) works through creating network Security Group (NSG) inbound rules. When first configured, JIT creates low priority **Deny** rules for each port that your JIT policy defines for the virtual machine (VM).

### JIT naming conventions

The naming convention for the rule is:

* **SecurityCenter-JITRule-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**

Any other naming convention is not created by JIT.

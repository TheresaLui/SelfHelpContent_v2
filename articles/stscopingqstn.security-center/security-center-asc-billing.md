# Security Center Billing self help guide

## **Recommended Steps**

**Why am I being billed? If I have Azure Defender for servers enabled at the subscription level, do I pay for not-running servers?**  

No, Azure Security Center (ASC) charges hourly only for running servers. If a server is turned off, you won't pay for that server during the time it's off. This applies to all other resource types protected by ASC as well

**Azure Defender for Servers is enabled on my subscription, but I didn't install the Log Analytics agent on this subscription's servers. Will I be charged for these machines?**

Azure VMs that are in a subscription with Azure Defender for enabled servers have capabilities even when the Log Analytics agent isnâ€™t installed, including just-in-time access, network threat detection, regulatory compliance, and adaptive network hardening. Therefore, all Azure VMS in this subscription are charged

Arc machines will be charged only if a Log Analytics agent is installed and reports data to a workspace with 'Security' or 'AntiMalware' solution installed

**If a Log Analytics agent is configured to send data to two different Log Analytics workspaces (multi-homing), will I be charged twice?**  

Yes, you'll be charged for each Log Analytics workspace that the agent reports to, assuming that the Log Analytics workspace has security or anti-malware solutions installed and the agent is up and running

**If a Log Analytics agent is configured to send data to two different log analytics workspaces(multi-homing), do I get the 500 MB free Log Analytics ingestion benefit for each one of the reported Log Analytics workspaces?**  

Yes, the 500 MB free ingestion is per node, per reported workspace, per day, assuming that the Log Analytics workspace has security or anti-malware solutions installed. If the ingested data exceeds 500 MB, you'll pay the extra amount

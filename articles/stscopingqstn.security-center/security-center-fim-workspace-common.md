- The server that enables File Integrity monitoring must be monitored by Azure security center and the Azure Log Analytics agent must to be healthy.
- Azure security center needs to be on standard mode on the subscription level, and every User workspace that the end-user wants to use should also be in standard (security solution be should install on it).

# Subscriptions Coverage Common Solutions

The Security Center dashboard may show a higher number of subscriptions under Subscription coverage than the number of subscriptions shown under Policy management. Subscription coverage shows the number of Standard, Free, and not covered subscriptions. The not covered subscriptions do not have Security Center enabled and are not displayed under Policy management.

**Coverage** - Identifies the pricing tier, Free or Standard, that the management group, subscription, or workspace is running on. See [Pricing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing) to learn more about Security Center's pricing tiers.

When you upgrade your [Azure Security Center to Standard tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing), you have the flexibility to choose which resource type you want to upgrade to Standard, which includes: Virtual Machine, SQL Server, App Service, and Storage Account.

When all resources are enabled, your subscription coverage will appear as "Fully Covered", and if you have at least one resource type that is not enabled, it will appear as "Partially covered"

# JIT Connect (from VM blade)

Just in Time (JIT) Connect is attached to the Azure Security Center JIT, and is aimed to provide a fast and easy connection experience through JIT.

JIT Connect provides two (2) parameters to configure: **IP Address** and **port**. The default is **Source IP = Any (*)**, and the time duration is set in the policy.

If you are unable to request access using JIT connect, try requesting using an ASC JIT Access request.

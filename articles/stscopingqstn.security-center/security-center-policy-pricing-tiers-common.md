# Pricing Tiers Common Solutions

Security Center is offered in two tiers:

- The Free tier is automatically enabled on all Azure subscriptions, and provides security policy, continuous security assessment, and actionable security recommendations to help you protect your Azure resources
- The Standard tier extends the capabilities of the Free tier to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads. The Standard tier also adds advanced threat detection capabilities, which use built-in behavioral analytics and machine learning to identify attacks and zero-day exploits, access and application controls to reduce exposure to network attacks and malware, and more

To enable all Security Center features, you must apply the Standard pricing tier to the subscription containing the applicable virtual machines. Configuring pricing for a workspace does not enable just in time VM access, adaptive application controls, and network detections for Azure resources.

Security Center billing is always based on your Security Center security policy and the solutions installed on a workspace. For the Free tier, Security Center enables the **SecurityCenterFree** solution on the default workspace. For the Standard tier, Security Center enables the **Security** solution on the default workspace. Storing data in Log Analytics might incur additional charges for data storage, see the pricing page for more details.

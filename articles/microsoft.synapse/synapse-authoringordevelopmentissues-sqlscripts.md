* Review the [differences between SQL pool and SQL On-demand](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/overview-features)
* Review the [differences between Azure SQL Database and Synapse SQL pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-troubleshoot#differences-from-sql-database)
* If the feature you are trying to use was recently released, confirm that your Synapse SQL Pool is updated to a version that supports the features being used

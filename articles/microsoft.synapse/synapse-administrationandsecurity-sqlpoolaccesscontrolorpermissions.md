# Administration and Security/SQL pool Access control or permissions

## **Recommended Steps**

The following details explain how to set up and update common access and permissions rules in SQL pool.

* If you're looking to change the administrator password for a Synapse SQL pool (data warehouse), you can simply click "Reset Password" at the top of the SQL Server resource blade

* If you're looking to change the administrator password for a SQL pool in Synapse Workspace, you can simply click "Reset SQL admin password" at the top of the Synapse workspace resource blade

* To set-up and connect to SQL pool using [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-authentication/) authentication

* [Secure your SQL Pool](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-overview-manage-security/)

### What access control can be done at the server level

* Roles cannot be made at the [server level](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-server-role?view=sql-server-2017&viewFallbackFrom=sql-server-2017?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630403/), they must be made at the database level

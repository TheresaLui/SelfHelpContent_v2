# Azure Portal and Client Tools/Other Client Tools

## **Recommended Steps**

Choose a SQL client to issue queries:
- [Azure Synapse Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-synapse-studio) is a web tool that you can use to browse files in storage and create SQL query.

- [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/get-started-azure-data-studio) is a client tool that enables you to run SQL queries and notebooks on your database.

- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/get-started-ssms) is a client tool that enables you to run SQL queries on your database.

- You can use your third-party business applications, like Tableau and Power BI, to connect to Dedicated SQL pool and Serverless SQL pool.

Spark supports [IntelliJ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/intellij-tool-synapse).

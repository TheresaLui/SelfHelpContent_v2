# Spark Job Failures/.NET Spark (C#)

## **Recommended Steps**

The most common challenge is memory pressure, because of improper configurations (particularly wrong-sized executors), long-running operations, and tasks that result in Cartesian operations. 
* [Use optimal data format](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#use-optimal-data-format)
* [Use the cache](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#use-the-cache)
* [Use memory efficiently](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#use-memory-efficiently)
* [Optimize data serialization](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#optimize-data-serialization)
* [Use bucketing](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#use-bucketing)
* [Optimize joins and shuffles](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#optimize-joins-and-shuffles)
* [Optimize job execution](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance?branch=release-ignite-arcadia#optimize-job-execution)

If the package you are installing is large or takes a long time to install, this affects the Spark instance startup time. Please review [Augmenting Apache Spark with additional libraries](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-azure-portal-add-libraries).

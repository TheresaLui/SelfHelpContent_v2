# Synapse Studio, Azure Portal and Client Tools/Synapse Studio

### Known issues

* If you have multiple AAD logins that is cached to your browser, opening Synapse Studio from Portal might not complete as your browser might try to use a different AAD account to authenticate you to Synapse Studio system. You might need to log off (or remove) other AAD account that is cached to your browser to complete your login to Synapse Studio.

* Creation of a new SQL pool operation might appear to have failed if your workspace name starts with a number. However, SQL pool is created successfully, the GRANT control setting would not have been applied correctly in this scenario. You need to follow the below steps to have the proper "Grant CONTROL" setting applied manually to your newly created SQL pools.

	1. Click on "Launch Synapse Studio" in the portal. 
	2. Click Data in the Left Navigation Panel and navigate to the SQL Pool that needs the setting in the Databases section. 
	3. Invoke a "New SQL Script" on the SQL Pool 

	a. To create a new workspace managed identity user and to assign control permissions to the user run the following in the pool:<br>
	```CREATE USER [WorkspaceName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER```<br>
	```GRANT CONTROL TO [WorkspaceName]```

	b. To revoke control on the SQL Pool (Note that Synapse orchestration scenarios will not work if this run on this SQL Pool)<br>
	```REVOKE CONTROL TO [WorkspaceName]```

	c. To drop Workspace managed identity user (Note that Synapse orchestration scenarios will not work if this run on this SQL Pool)<br>
	```DROP USER [WorkspaceName]```

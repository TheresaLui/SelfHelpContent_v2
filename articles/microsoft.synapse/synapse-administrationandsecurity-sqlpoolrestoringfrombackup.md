# Administration and Security/SQL pool Restoring from backup

## **Recommended Steps**

* Create user-defined restore points via [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-points#create-user-defined-restore-points-through-the-azure-portal) or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-points)
* If you are trying to restore a data warehouse from a backup:

	* Restore a deleted data warehouse using [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-deleted-dw#restore-a-deleted-database-using-the-azure-portal) or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-deleted-dw#restore-a-deleted-data-warehouse-through-powershell)
	* Restore an active or paused data warehouse using [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-active-paused-dw#restore-an-existing-data-warehouse-through-the-azure-portal) or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-active-paused-dw#restore-an-existing-data-warehouse-through-powershell). Note that when restoring, you can specify a different ServiceObjectiveName (DWU) or a different server residing in a different region.
	* If portal doesnâ€™t show restore point, use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/get-azsqldatabaserestorepoint?view=azps-2.4.0#examples) to confirm if the restore point was created. Please note that the default retention for Synapse SQL pools is 7 days.  
	
* If you have recently renamed your Synapse database and you receive the following error when trying to recover a geo-backup:

    "No Geo-Backup has been created yet" (via Portal) 
    
    "NotFound" (via PowerShell).

    This may be because the rename has not been replicated to your regional pair. Customers experiencing this issue can use the old name to recover their Synapse database. 


* If you are moving or restoring your data warehouse across subscriptions:

	* Go through the [checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources#checklist-before-moving-resources) before moving your data warehouse across subscriptions
	* If you need to 'restore' with a new data warehouse across subscriptions, follow the instructions [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Data-Warehouse-Support/How-To-Move-your-Azure-Data-Warehouse-to-a-new-region-and-or/ba-p/682907)
	* If you are restoring the data warehouse to a different server, follow this [checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-disaster-recovery#configure-your-database-after-recovery) to ensure recovered data warehouse has appropriate security configuration
	* To re-map a database user to a different login, use ```ALTER USER <UserName> WITH LOGIN = <LoginName>```

* If you receive an error message stating "The server is not in a ready state", check the status of the destination SQL Server to ensure that it is in an "Available" state. The status can be found in the Overview pane of the destination SQL Server in the Azure Portal.

* Please note that Synapse Analytics SQL pools do not currently support table level restores. It is only possible to recover an entire database from your backup.

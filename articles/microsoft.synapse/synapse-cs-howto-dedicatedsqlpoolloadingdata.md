# How-To/Dedicated SQL pool - Loading Data

## **Recommended Steps**

Always leverage Polybase to batch load into your Dedicated SQL pool and avoid singleton inserts.

* Use CTAS as opposed to INSERT INTO to avoid full logging into [staging heap tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/design-elt-data-loading) (especially on Gen2) and consider [partition switching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-partition) to optimize load performance

* Make sure to co-locate your staging area (blob storage or data lake store) and your Dedicated SQL pool to minimize latency

* Maximize throughput when using gzip text files by splitting files up into 60 or more files to maximize parallelism

* [Use the appropriate resource class and service level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/guidance-for-loading-data) to ensure [enough memory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/guidance-for-loading-data#loading-to-a-staging-table). As you scale your service level, SQL pool increases the numbers of readers and writers for parallelism.

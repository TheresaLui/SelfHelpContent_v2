# SQL Performance and Query Execution/SQL Performance and Query Execution

## **Recommended Steps**
* T-SQL Predict is used for batch scoring scenario in the data warehouse without moving the data out of the data warehouse. See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql) for details.
* Only models of ONNX format are supported with the Predict statement in the data warehouse.
* The column names of the scoring input data should match the column names of the model inputs.
* Data warehouse doesn't support multidimensional array so ensure that the training inputs are individual inputs instead of an array.

## **Recommended Documents**
* [PREDICT (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql)

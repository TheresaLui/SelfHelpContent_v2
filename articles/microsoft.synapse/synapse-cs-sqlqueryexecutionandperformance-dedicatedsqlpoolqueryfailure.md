# SQL Query Execution and Performance/Dedicated SQL pool - Query failure

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check [Analyze your workload in Dedicated SQL pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/analyze-your-workload#queued-query-detection-and-other-dmvs) for queued query and the resources a request is waiting for

* To resolve out of memory errors, [try increasing the user's resource class](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/resource-classes-for-workload-management#change-a-users-resource-class) or [scale your Dedicated SQL pool to a larger service level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/quickstart-scale-compute-portal)

* To resolve syntax error for queries, check the [T-SQL syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-reference-tsql-statements)

* To resolve, error: "Database 'Distribution_40_Cache' cannot be opened due to inaccessible files or insufficient memory or disk space", try pausing and resuming your Dedicated SQL pool

* To resolve, error: "Unable to allocate ###### KB for columnstore compression because it exceeds the remaining memory from total allocated for current resource class and DWU" [try increasing the user's resource class](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/resource-classes-for-workload-management#change-a-users-resource-class)

* Databases with Non-Default Collation can affect the behavior of queries and display abnormal behavior when interacting with third-party tooling.  NOTE: the default database collation cannot be changed. See [Database collation support for Azure Synapse Analytics Dedicated SQL pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-reference-collation-types) for more information including how to check your database's collation.

* To resolve internal error (5123, 50), try reducing the IO usage. Consider moving to a higher resource class, reduce number of partitions of the table or rebuild CCI tables.

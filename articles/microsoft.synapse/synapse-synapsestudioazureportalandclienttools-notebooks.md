# Synapse Studio, Azure Portal and Client Tools/Notebooks

## **Recommended Steps**

Review [Apache Spark Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/author-sql-script). 

You can reference data across languages [using temp tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-development-using-notebooks#use-temp-tables-to-reference-data-across-languages).

Notebooks are integrated with the Monaco editor to bring IDE-style [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-development-using-notebooks#ide-style-intellisense) to the cell editor.

You can visualize data in a notebook with [```Display()```](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-development-using-notebooks#display) and [```DisplayHTML()```](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-development-using-notebooks#displayhtml).

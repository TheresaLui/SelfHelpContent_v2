# SQL Query Execution and Performance/Dedicated SQL pool - Queries using PREDICT

## **Recommended Steps**

* T-SQL Predict is used for batch scoring scenario in the Dedicated SQL pool without moving the data out of the Dedicated SQL pool. See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql) for details.

* Only models of ONNX format are supported with the Predict statement in the Dedicated SQL pool.

* The column names of the scoring input data should match the column names of the model inputs.

* Dedicated SQL pool doesn't support multidimensional array so ensure that the training inputs are individual inputs instead of an array.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [PREDICT (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql)

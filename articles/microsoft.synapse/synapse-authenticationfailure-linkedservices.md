# Authentication failure/Linked Services

## **Recommended Steps**

Make sure you provided right credentials while creating your linked service. You can review [Grant permissions to workspace managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-grant-workspace-managed-identity-permissions) to allow your Synapse Workspace have access to the resources you want to link.

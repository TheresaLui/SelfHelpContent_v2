# Authentication failure/Linked Services

## **Recommended Steps**

Make sure you provided right credentials while creating your linked service. You can review [Grant permissions to workspace managed identity](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-grant-worspace-managed-identity-permissions?branch=release-ignite-arcadia) to allow your Synapse Workspace have access to the resources you want to link.

# Administration and Security/Dedicated SQL pool - Auditing

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Can [fn_get_audit_file()](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-functions/sys-fn-get-audit-file-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest) be used to read audit files from Synapse dedicated SQL pool?**
  Yes, but the connection needs to be established to the logical server master database, or to an SQL DB database, and not to a Synapse database.

## **Recommended Documents** 

For getting started with auditing, refer to [Auditing - servers, pools, and databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630407/) document.

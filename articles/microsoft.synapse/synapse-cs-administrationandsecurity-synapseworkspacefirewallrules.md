# Administration and Security/Synapse Workspace - Firewall Rules

## **Recommended Steps**

[IP firewall rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/security/synapse-workspace-ip-firewall) grant or deny access to your Synapse workspace based on the originating IP address of each request. You can configure IP firewall rules for your workspace. IP firewall rules configured at the workspace level apply to all public endpoints of the workspace (Dedicated SQL pools, Serverless SQL pool, and Development).

Diagnose Azure Synapse Studio connectivity issues with [```Test-AzureSynapse``` PowerShell script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-synapse-studio-powershell).

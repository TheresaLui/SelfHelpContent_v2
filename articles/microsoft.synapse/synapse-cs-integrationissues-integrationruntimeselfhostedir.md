# Integration Issues/Integration Runtime - Self Hosted IR

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you receive an error message about a self-hosted IR general failure or error, a self-hosted IR upgrade, or self-hosted IR connectivity issues, which can generate a long queue, see [Troubleshoot self-hosted integration runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json)

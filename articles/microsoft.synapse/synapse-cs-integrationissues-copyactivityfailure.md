# Integration Issues/Copy Activity failure

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you receive an error message about an activity, see [Troubleshoot activity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-troubleshoot-guide?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json)

* If you receive an error message from any source or destination via connectors, which can generate a long queue, see the [Connector Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-troubleshoot-guide?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json)

* If you receive an error message from copy data tool, see the [Copy Data tool troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/v1/data-factory-azure-copy-wizard?toc=%2Fazure%2Fsynapse-analytics%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fsynapse-analytics%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#troubleshooting)

* If you receive an error message about a self-hosted IR general failure or error, a self-hosted IR upgrade, or self-hosted IR connectivity issues, which can generate a long queue, see [Troubleshoot self-hosted integration runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/breadcrumb/toc.json)

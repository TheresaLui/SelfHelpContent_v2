# How to check the VIP/DIP for Basic Internal LB

## **Recommended Steps**

We now know the SKU/facing direction of the Load Balancer we are troubleshooting. These steps will help you find the VIP/DIP for the load balancer

* Gather these details and input them below. We will need them later
* First use ASC to get the Deployment ID of a VM that is behind the ILB
  * Go to Jarvis Actions --> Regional Network Manager --> Deployment --> Get all service instances from serviceId. or use first link below
  * In the Region field, select the region the VM is in.
  * In the Service ID field, paste in the VMs Deployment ID
  * Click Run
  * After it has ran, select the 'Messages' tab. Copy the id from the 'service instance id:' (Its almost identical to the deployment ID but has additional numbers at the end)
* Go to Actions --> Regional Network Manager --> Deployment --> Get Allocated resources for a given service instance (its two actions down from the last action we ran) or use second link below
  * Paste in the service instance id we got from the last action.
  * In the Results tab, ILB VIP is at the bottom

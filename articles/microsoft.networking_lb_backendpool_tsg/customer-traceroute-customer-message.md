# Customer traceroute is needed to diagnose potential connectivity issue

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reached a point in the troubleshooting process where we need additional information to further diagnose the connectivity issue. Please perform a traceroute from an allowed source host to the VIP for this load balancer and provide us with a screen capture or cut/paste of that traceroute. This will help us determine if there is a network path from your source to the VIP.  

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

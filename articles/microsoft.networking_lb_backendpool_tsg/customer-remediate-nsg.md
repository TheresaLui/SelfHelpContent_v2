# Ensure listening port and open NSG to allow source IP

Please have the customer complete the following:

* Ensure there is an application listening on the port
* Open up the NSG to the source IP in question
* If the backend pool contains Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) reference this [NVA TSG](https://aka.ms/anpnvawiki) for additional troubleshooting steps.

# Support for Basic Load Balancer only exists within the same region

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. We’ve reviewed your configuration and we’ve determined your issue is due to the use of a basic load balancer. Resources in one virtual network cannot communicate with the front-end IP address of a basic internal load balancer in a globally peered vnet. Our suggestion at this time is to migrate your basic load balancer to a standard load balancer where this is a supported scenario. Here are the instructions of how to do it: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/upgrade-basic-standard  

Best regards,

# Add UDR for the BE pool subnet

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed your configuration and have determined that your connectivity issue is due to a missing UDR for the BE pool subnet. Please repair this issue by creating a UDR on the BE pool subnet with a route for 0.0.0.0/Internet

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

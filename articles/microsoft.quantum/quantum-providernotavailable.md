# A Provider is not available in a particular region

Not every provider is available in every Azure region where Azure Quantum is available.

The *recommended steps* below should help you work out if a provider should be available in your region.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Please review our [provider documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Azure-Quantum-provider) to check if your desired provider is available in your region
   * If trying to add a third-party provider. consider contacting them directly for more details regarding availability in the region you would like to use
2. If using the CLI, verify that the provider/target combination that you are requesting is valid
3. If unsure, deploy a workspace in a different region to check if the provider is available to select there

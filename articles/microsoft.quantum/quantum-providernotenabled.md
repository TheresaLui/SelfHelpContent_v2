# A Provider or Target is not enabled in your Workspace

When you attempt to submit a job you may receive either of the below errors:

- `The provider specified does not exist or is not enabled for the workspace`
- `The target specified does not exist or is not enabled for the workspace`

This error occurs when you have not enabled the requested provider in your workspace, or have not selected a Plan that gives you access to the desired target.

It is also possible that the desired target/provider combination does not exist.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Navigate to your Quantum Workspace resource in the Portal
1. Select the [Providers blade](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Quantum.ProvidersBlade.assetId.$resourceId)
1. If you see the desired provider, enabled it in the list of providers, follow the instructions below under "Modify a Provider". Otherwise, follow the instructions under "Enable a Provider".

### Enable a Provider

If you have not already enabled the provider in your workspace, you will need to enable them. From the `Providers` blade of your Quantum Workspace:

1. Select the "Add a provider" button at the top of the blade
1. Find the desired provider in the list of providers and select "Add"
1. Identify the plan which gives you access to the desired Target. You may need to reference the providers' documentation.
1. Accept the providers terms, and click `Enable`
1. Wait for the deployment to complete and try submitting a job against the provider

### Modify a Provider

If you have enabled the provider, you may not have selected a plan which allows you to access your desired target. From the `Providers` blade of your Quantum Workspace:

1. Find the provider in the list of enabled providers
1. Select "Modify"
1. Identify the plan which gives you access to the desired Target. You may need to reference the providers' documentation.
1. Accept the providers terms, and click `Enable`
1. Wait for the deployment to complete and try submitting a job against the provider

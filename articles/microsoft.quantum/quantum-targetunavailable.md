# A Provider or Target is 'Unavailable' or 'Degraded'

Targets may be sometimes be either offline, or not performing at their regular capacity due to the complexity of quantum hardware. When a target is in this state the target and/or provider may show as degraded or unavailable.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure the provider/target combination that you are trying to specify is valid. You can refer to the [provider documention](https://) for further details...
2. If you are trying to use a target that is supported by a third party provider, please use their support process to inquire about the status of the provider and its targets
3. If you are targeting a first-party provider/target combination or believe that the issue you are seeing is caused by the Azure Quantum service itself, please raise a support case, and a member of the team will assist you.

* Ensure all links to Microsoft docs are non-region-specific, i.e. does not include /en-us/. This does not apply to articles for Mooncake.
* Don't link to internal review documentation - these URLs always start with "review.microsoft.docs", and users are unable to access them
* Do not use aka.ms links
* Copy the raw form of this article to use as a template for your own Common Solution article. Be sure to fill in the metadata!

# A Provider or Target is 'Unavailable' or 'Degraded'

Targets may be sometimes be either offline, or not performing at their regular capacity due to the complexity of quantum hardware. When a target is in this state the target and/or provider may show as degraded or unavailable.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure the provider/target combination that you are trying to specify is valid. You can refer to the [provider documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Azure-Quantum-provider) for further details...
2. If you are trying to use a target that is supported by a third party provider, please use their support process to inquire about the status of the provider and its targets
3. If you are targeting a first-party provider/target combination or believe that the issue you are seeing is caused by the Azure Quantum service itself, please raise a support case, and a member of the team will assist you.

# Azure AD Connect sync service is not running. The Service account failed to authenticate.
<!--issueDescription-->
The Sync service is not running due to expired Windows Service account credentials. As a result, objects will not synchronize with Azure Active Directory.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

- Verify if the service account used to run synchronization service exists in your Active Directory
- Verify that the service account password has not expired. It is recommended that the account should be configured with "password never expires" option.
- Ensure the service account has right permissions to log into Windows. Check if any group policy is changing the permissions.

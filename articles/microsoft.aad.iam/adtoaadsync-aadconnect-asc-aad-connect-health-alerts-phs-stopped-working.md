# Password Hash Synchronization has stopped working
<!--issueDescription-->
Password Hash Synchronization has stopped. As a result passwords will not be synchronized with Azure Active Directory.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
Restart Microsoft Azure Active Directory Sync Services. Any synchronization operations that are currently running will be interrupted, therefore restart when no synchronization operation is in progress.

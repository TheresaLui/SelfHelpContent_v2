# Risk investigation (such as alerts, risks, and reporting)

## **Recommended steps**

Your investigation into risk will typically start with the Identity Protection dashboard. The dashboard gives you access to:
* Reports such as [Users flagged for risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-user-at-risk), [Risk events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risk-events), and [Vulnerabilities]
* Settings such as the configuration of your Security [Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-sign-in-risk-policy), [Notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/notifications), and [multi-factor authentication registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-mfa-policy)

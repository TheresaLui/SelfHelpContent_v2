## Adding Identity Providers

## Welcome to our new guided troubleshooting experience for Identity Providers issues. This experience integrates important documents and relevant results from the web. 

:::Section Recommended Solutions::: 

### **Can I add external identity providers to my application?**  

Yes, you can add identity providers that are supported by Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to your user flows using the Azure portal. [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers). 

Azure AD B2C also supports external identity providers like Facebook, Microsoft account, Google, Twitter, and any identity provider that supports OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML protocols. [Start by selecting an identity provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-identity-provider#select-an-identity-provider).

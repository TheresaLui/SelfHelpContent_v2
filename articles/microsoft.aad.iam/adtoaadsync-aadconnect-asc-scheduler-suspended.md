# The Azure AD Sync scheduler is suspended
<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected the synchronization cycle is suspended on server(s) for your tenant.
<!--/issueDescription-->

When the synchronization cycle is suspended on an Azure AD Connect server, the synchronization process will no longer synchronize data between the on-premises Active Directory and Azure Active Directory. The scheduler is suspended by Connect during an upgrade to temporarily block the scheduler from running. Normally, the upgrade process will re-enable the scheduler to run as scheduled after the upgrade process completes. Under some circumstances this does not happen correctly, causing the scheduler to be suspended.

You need to re-enable the scheduler to synchronize data again.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Run the following cmdlet on each affected Azure AD Connect server: `Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true`

	This cmdlet will enable the synchronization cycle and synchronization will resume at the configured interval.

# Sync service account does not have permissions to update AD Objects
<!--issueDescription-->
The service account used for synchronization does not have permissions to update AD Objects. As a result some of the objects with the Active Directory may not be synchronized with Azure Active Directory.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Please perform the following actions:
- Verify if the service account used to run synchronization service exists in your Active Directory
- Verify that the service account password has not expired. It is recommended that the account should be configured with "password never expires" option.
- Verify that the account has the required permissions to access your Active Directory objects
- Ensure the service account has right permissions to log into Windows. Check if any group policy is changing the permissions.

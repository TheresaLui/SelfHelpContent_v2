<!--issueDescription-->
We noticed that there are issues with the account or the permissions that are assigned to the AD DS Connector Account.

* Verify that the service account used to run synchronization service exists in your Active Directory 
* Verify that the service account password has not expired. It is recommended that the account should be configured with "password never expires" option. 
* Verify that the account has the required permissions to access your Active Directory objects  
* Ensure the service account has right permissions to log into Windows
* Check if any group policy is changing the permissions

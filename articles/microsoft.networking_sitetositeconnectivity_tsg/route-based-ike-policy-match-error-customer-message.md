# Incorrect IKE Parameter

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your connectivity issue is due to an incorrect IKE parameter originating from your on-premise VPN device. Please correct your on-premise device configuration to resolve this issue. Please let us know if correcting this configuration resolves your connectivity issues.

Best regards,

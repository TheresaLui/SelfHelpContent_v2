# IKE Security Association deleted during IKE re-key

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that the on-premise device stopped the process of establishing a Security Association during the IKE re-key process. This can happen for a number of reasons, but as a first step, please ensure you are using a supported device and ensure that device is configured according to the VPN Device Scripts that Azure publishes for supported devices.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

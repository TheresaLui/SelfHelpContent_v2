# Gateway not sending IPsec traffic

The Azure VPN gateway is not initiating IKE traffic and/or is not responding at all to the on-prem device connection attempts. In this scenario, the issue is that the gateway tenant is not configured to connect to this specific on-prem device (in some circumstances, this could cause the gateway to load the "default" policy that uses Certificate authentication rather than PSK – this is a good pointer in the logs). Reasons for this may include:

* The IP address of the on-prem device may be incorrect. Fix the IP address.
* The customer might have not created a connection object. Create one.
* The SiteConnectivityAction flag is set to Disconnect. Change it to Connect using the link below.
* The customer might have configured everything correctly, but the gateway tenant may still miss to be properly configured.

# On-premise VPN device is behaving in an supported way

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. We’ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your on-premise VPN device is attempting to change the connection parameters after an IPSec tunnel is already established. This is not a supported capability of Azure VPN Gateway. Often times, this is caused by the on-premise device missing the “lifetime in bytes” configuration. Please correct your on-premise device or work with your on-premise device vendor to ensure it does not attempt to change connection parameters after an IPSec session is established.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

# Customer must use a supported device

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. We've reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your connectivity issue is likely due to the use of an unsupported onpremise device. Unsupported devices have not been fully tested with Azure and as a result, we can only provide best effort support. Our suggestion at this time is to move to a supported device.  

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

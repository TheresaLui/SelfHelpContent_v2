# Lifetime change QM Notify

* The on-prem device is trying to change a connection parameter after the Main Mode is already established.
* This is not supported by our gateway.
* The customer needs to fix their on-prem device to establish the IPsec session directly with the final settings we want to use.
* Often times, this is caused by the on-prem device missing the Lifetime in bytes setting.

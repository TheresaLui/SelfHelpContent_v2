# Customer device may be unsupported or configured as a Responder only

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that no IKE negotiation packets are being seen on the Azure VPN Gateway. This may be because your on-premise VPN device is configured as a "Responder" and not an "Initiator". We recommend configuring on-premise device both as Responder and Initiator. If this is not possible, then please generate traffic from Azure towards your on-premise network in order to bring up the VPN connection.  

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

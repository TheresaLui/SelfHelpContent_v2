# How to check for traffic selector misconfiguration

## **Recommended Steps**

* In this scenario, there are Traffic Selectors in place that are only allowing connectivity to certain subnets and not to others
* Notice that usage of such limited traffic selectors may not prevent the VPN tunnel from correctly establishing, but will only block traffic from flowing
* The traffic selectors may exist on the Azure configuration or the customer configuration
* Traffic Selector configuration should match both sides in the Azure Site-to-Site VPN. By default, in a route-based VPN, Azure is configured to accept 0.0.0.0/0; however, if the peer site is configured with a narrow Traffic Selector, the connection will not establish while Azure is the initiator. Make sure that the Traffic Selectors match both sides.
* If you need to view Traffic Selector logs, review IkeLogs table in Kusto at the time of the issue
* Please use the 'Start Over' button to restart this workflow and use the Resource Unreachable Traffic Selector path

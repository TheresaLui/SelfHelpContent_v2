## **Planned Maintenance**

* Please remember that our gateways would trigger a failover proactively for every Host maintenance event and this is a new change to reduce the over all downtime.  Traditionally we were depending on SLB time-out to trigger the failover which introduced more delays.
* Inform the customer the Disconnection is caused by planned maintenance.

# Incorrect IKE Payload from on-premise VPN device

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. We've reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your on-premise device is sending an incorrect IKE payload. Our suggestion at this time is to contact your third party on-premise device vendor to correct its IKE payload settings.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

# Customer must correct on-premise device configuration

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for providing us with your on-premise device configuration. We've reviewed your configuration and determined it does not meet the configuration standards that Microsoft has published for on-premise VPN devices that connect to Azure VPN Gateway. Please review the configuration standards Microsoft has published, correct any variations and attempt to establish a VPN Gateway connection.

Please let us know if this does or does not correct the connectivity issue.

Best Regards

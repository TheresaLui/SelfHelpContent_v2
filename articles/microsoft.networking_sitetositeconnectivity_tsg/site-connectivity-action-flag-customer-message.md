# VPN Gateway status is set to Disconnect

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. We're reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your connectivity issue is due to a configuration on the VPN Gateway. Currently, your VPN Gateway is set to "disconnect" status in the Azure Portal. This prevents any kind of connection to the Azure VPN Gateway. To allow connections again, please follow the steps we're providing to flip this configuration from Disconnect to Connect.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

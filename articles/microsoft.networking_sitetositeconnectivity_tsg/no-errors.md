# No IKE negotiation packets observed on the logs

## **Recommended Steps**

* Please check if the on-premises device is configured only as a Responder
* In this case, even if the interesting traffic is triggered from on-premises, the tunnel would not come up unless the traffic is originating from Azure end
* If the on-premises device cannot be configured as an Initiator, then generate traffic from Azure towards on-premises to bring up the tunnel
* Ideally the on-premises device needs to be configured both as Initiator and Responder
* If there is a limitation on the third-party device, the VPN device vendor must be engaged for further assistance
* Additionally, you may review the workflow for known issues with third-party devices

## **Use of traffic selectors**

* If narrow traffic selectors aren't being used, it means that the Azure VPN Gateway is configured to use 0.0.0.0/0 <-> 0.0.0.0/0 traffic selectors.
* However, the on-prem device may still narrow down the Traffic Selectors
* Review IkeLogs/ SeamlessTunnelServiceTraceTable in ASC or Jarvis/Kusto from the time of the issue to see which side is using traffic selectors.

# Invalid IKE cookies originating from on premise device

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your VPN Gateway connectivtiy issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed the diagnostics we have available to us and have determined the connectivity issue is caused by the on-premise VPN device sending invalid IKE Cookies. IKE Cookies are a normal part of the IKE process to improve security of IKE. Please engage your on-premise device vendor to troubleshoot and diagnose this issue further.

Best Regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

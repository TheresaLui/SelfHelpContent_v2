# How to check for the Use of traffic selectors

## **Recommended Steps**

* If the tunnel is connected and there are reachability issues, ensure that the effective routes on Azure VM has the route for VPN Gateway, and on-prem machines have respective return routes.
* There may be Traffic Selectors in place that are only allowing connectivity to certain subnets and not to others.
* Notice that usage of such limited traffic selectors may not prevent the VPN tunnel from correctly establishing, but will only block traffic from flowing
* The traffic selectors may exist on the Azure configuration or the customer configuration
* Traffic Selector configuration should match both sides in the Azure Site-to-Site VPN. By default, in a route-based VPN, Azure is configured to accept 0.0.0.0/0; however, if the peer site is configured with a narrow Traffic Selector, the connection will not establish while Azure is the initiator. Make sure that the Traffic Selectors match both sides.
* If you need to view Traffic Selectors, review IkeLogs table from ASC/Jarvis/Kusto 
* In case of Policy Based gateway, make sure the TS include the subnet/address prefix you are trying to reach.  If the address prefix/subnet are missing then please add them to allow access.

# Missing or incorrect connection object may result in connectivity issues

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issues. Through troubleshooting, we've determined that the connectivity issues are a result of potential misconfigurations with the Azure VPN Gateway as it relates to its configuration about your on-premise gateway. Please verify your configuration and ensure you have a connection object configurated, that the on-premise IP address is correctly configured and verify that your connection is not set to "Disconnect".  

Please let us know if correcting these configurations fixes your connectivity issues.  

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

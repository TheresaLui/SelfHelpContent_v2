**IKE SA Deleted Error**

* We were in a process of re-establishing a Security Association, but the on-prem device sent a Delete before we were able to complete the rekey.
* Identify from IKElogsTable if there is more detail about the malformed packet
* Verify that the customer’s device is in the list of supported VPN devices and that its configuration matches the one linked in the official documentation
* If the customer is using Cisco, Juniper or Ubiquiti devices you can also download the VPN device script from Azure to match the configuration exactly

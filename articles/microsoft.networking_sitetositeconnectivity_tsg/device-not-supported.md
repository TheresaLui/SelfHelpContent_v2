# Device is not supported

## **Recommended Steps**

* In case of an unsupported VPN device, the support is on a best-effort basis
* We may see inconsistent behavior with non-tested VPN devices resulting in VPN connectivity issues
* In these scenarios, we should be able to share our findings from our logs with the customer, and at this point he/she may have to engage the respective device vendor for further investigation/support
* For the third-party devices that we support, you may review the workflow for some of the known issues

# IKE Payload is Invalid

## **Recommended Steps**

* IKE payload is invalid.
* The on-prem device is sending an incorrect IKE payload.
* Tell customer to engage the third-party device vendor
* When Azure is initiator, and if the peer only accepts narrow traffic selectors, the following message will be logged in IkeLogsTable/TunnelInsightsEventTable **Invalid payload received**
  * To fix this, please configure narrow Traffic Selectors on Azure VPN Gateway

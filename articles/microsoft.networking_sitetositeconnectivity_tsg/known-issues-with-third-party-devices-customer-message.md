# On-premise device is not supported or has known compatibility issues

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting  us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. Through our troubleshooting process, we've determined that you're using a third party on-premise device that is either unsupported or has known known compatibility issues with Azure. Please adjust your on-premise device to work in a way that is supported and compatible with Azure – this may require using a different device type or working with your third party on-premise device vendor to resolve the configuration.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

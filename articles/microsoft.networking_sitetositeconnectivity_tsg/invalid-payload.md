**Invalid Payload**

* The IPsec security association failed to get established because the payload sent by the on-prem device is either malformed, or configured in a way not supported by the Azure Gateway.
* Identify from IKElogsTable if there is more detail about the malformed packet
* Verify that the customer’s device is in the list of supported VPN devices and that its configuration matches the one linked in the official documentation
* If the customer is using Cisco, Juniper or Ubiquiti devices you can also download the VPN device script from Azure to match the configuration exactly

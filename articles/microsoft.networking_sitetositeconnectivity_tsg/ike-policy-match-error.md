# IKE Policy Match Error

## Recommended Steps

 IKE Policy Mismatch error means that one or more of the IPsec parameters offered by Azure gateway is not supported by the on-prem device, or that one or more of the IPsec parameters offered by the on-prem device is not supported by the Azure gateway.

* Identify from WFPdiag.txt what is the incorrect parameter(s)
* Verify that the virtual network address range and on-prem network (local gateway) subnets match exactly on both the Azure Gateway configuration and the on-prem device configuration.
* Verify that the customer’s device is in the list of supported VPN devices and that its configuration matches the one linked in the official documentation

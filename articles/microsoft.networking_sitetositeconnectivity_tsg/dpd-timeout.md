# DPD Timeout

## **Recommended Steps**

* The connection was closed due to dead peer detection
* DPD packets sent by the azure gateway are not being responded
* Collect traces on the on-prem device
* If the customer’s device isn’t responding, then escalate the issue to the customer
* If we have logs/traces from the on-prem device showing that the device is receiving our traffic and correctly responding, the issue may be within the Azure infrastructure - but outside the VPN gateway scope
* Review NetVMA status for the gateway at the time of the issue:

  * If NetVMA shows suspicious behavior, the issue may be within the Azure infrastructure - but outside the VPN gateway scope.  Go to escalate.
  * If NetVMA doesn’t show suspicious activity, this might have been a short network glitch for which we can’t provide further RCA. Inform the customer that DPD timed out because of network issues. Go to Pending customer.

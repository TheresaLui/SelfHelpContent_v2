# Customer Must Correct On-Premise IP Address

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your connectivity issue with Azure VPN Gateway. Through the troubleshooting process we've determined that the on-premise IP Address that is attempting to connect to the VPN Gateway does not match the IP Address VPN Gateway is expecting a connection from. Please correct this issue by correcting the on-premise IP Address or configuring Azure VPN Gateway to accept the correct IP Address. 

Please let us know if this does or does not correct the connectivity issue.

Best Regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

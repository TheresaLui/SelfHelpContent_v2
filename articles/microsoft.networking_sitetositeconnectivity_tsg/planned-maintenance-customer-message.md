# Tunnel Reset due to Planned Maintenance

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. Weâ€™ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your VPN tunnel was reset due to planned maintenance on Azure. When host OS maintenance occurs, a VPN tunnel reset is a normal part of the expected behavior. If you need further assistance with this matter, please let us know.

Best regards,

# Tunnel Reset due to Planned Maintenance

<!--issueDescription-->
Dear customer,

Thank you for contacting us about your Azure VPN Gateway connectivity issue. We’ve reviewed the logs and diagnostics available to us and have determined that your VPN tunnel was reset due to planned maintenance on Azure. When host OS maintenance occurs, a VPN tunnel reset is a normal part of the expected behavior. If you need further assistance with this matter, please let us know.

Best regards,
<!--/issueDescription-->

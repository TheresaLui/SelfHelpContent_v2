# How to check if customer is using a supported device

## **Recommended Steps**

* Please ensure that the peer device is running with the recommended configuration and minimum OS version, as per our documentation (link below)
* If the peer device is not on the list of validated devices, or does not meet the minimum OS version, the support will be on a best effort basis, and the customer may still have to engage device vendor for further investigation based on our findings

**Note**: IKEv1 is not supported with Standard SKU VPN Gateways.

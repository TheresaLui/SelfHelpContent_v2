# Azure Resource Graph - Query Issues

*If you're hitting issues regarding Microsoft Graph API, please create your support request under "Azure Active Directory App Integration and Development" service, and choose Graph API as your problem type.*

This support request will be created for "Azure Resource Graph" (ARG) service. Azure Resource Graph is exposed in the following ways:

# Why is an external user's access package not being provisioned? 


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure that the directory the external user is coming from is allowed in your **Organizational relationships** settings. In the Azure portal for your directory, click **Azure Active Directory**, click **Organizational relationships**, click **Settings**, and then view the **Collaboration restrictions** settings.

# MFA Server (on-premises)

## **Recommended Steps**

As of July 1, 2019, Microsoft no longer offers MFA Server for new deployments. Customers who would like to require multi-factor authentication from their users should use cloud-based Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. Existing customers who have activated MFA Server prior to July 1, 2019 will be able to download the latest version, future updates and generate activation credentials as usual.

# Multi-Factor Authentication Issue Preventing User Sign-In

<!--issueDescription-->

As part of authentication request it has been detected that your phone number cannot be reached/subscriber is out of service area or cannot delivered SMS, which can prevent users from receiving authentication requests. Any authentication attempts for **Unreachable phone** or **MFA undelivered SMS** are automatically denied.

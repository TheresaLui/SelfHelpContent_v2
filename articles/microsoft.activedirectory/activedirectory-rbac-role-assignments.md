# Problems with RBAC role assignments

## **Recommended steps**

1. If you are unable to add a role assignment because the **Add role assignment** option is disabled or because you get a permissions error, check that you are using a role that has the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permission at the scope you are trying to assign the role. If you don't have this permission, check with your subscription administrator.
1. If you get a permissions error when you try to create a resource, check that you are using a role that has write permission to the resource at the selected scope. If you don't have write permission, check with your subscription administrator.
1. If you get a permissions error when you try to create or update a support ticket, check that you are using a role that has the Microsoft.Support/* permission, such as Support Request Contributor.
1. If you get an error that the number of role assignments are exceeded when you try to assign a role, try to reduce the number of role assignments by assigning roles to groups instead. Azure supports up to 2000 role assignments per subscription.

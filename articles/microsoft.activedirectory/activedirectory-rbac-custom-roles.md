# Problems with custom roles

## **Recommended Steps**

* Create a custom role with [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/tutorial-custom-role-powershell) or [CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/tutorial-custom-role-cli)
* If you are unable to update an existing custom role, ensure you have the Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write permission. For more information, see [Custom roles in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles).
* If you are unable to delete a custom role, check if there are any role assignments still using the custom role. If so, remove those role assignments and try to delete again.
* If you get an error that the role definition limit exceeded when you try to create a new role, delete any custom roles that arenâ€™t be used. Azure supports up to 2000 custom roles in a tenant.
* If you get an error that the scope (such as subscription or resource group) was not found when you try to update a custom role, check whether one or more assignable scopes have been deleted in the tenant. If the scope is deleted, then create a support ticket as there is no self-service solution available at this time.

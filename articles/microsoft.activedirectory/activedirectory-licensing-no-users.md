# A user doesn't have the right licenses

The full information about user licenses and their status is available on the **Licenses** blade for that user. If you don't see the licenses that you expect, try one or both of these tips.

1. If you are using group-based licensing to assign licenses to your users, it is possible that the system could not assign the license. This information is shown on the **Licenses** tab for the user. See the article on docs.microsoft.com about [identifying and resolving license problems with group-based licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal).

2. Verify that the license has not been removed by another administrator or process in your tenant. You can see a history of license changes made in your tenant on the [Audit logs blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Audit). You can search for the UPN (for example, joe@contoso.com) to see if a license has recently been removed.

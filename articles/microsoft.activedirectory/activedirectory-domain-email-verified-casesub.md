# Problems verifying a domain name because verified in another tenant

## **Recommended steps**

1. If you are getting an error that says “Domain already configured on another tenant”, please ensure that your custom domain name hasn’t already been configured on another Azure AD or Office 365. A User in your organization may have already signed up self-service with that domain name. You will need to remove the domain name from the existing tenant where the domain name is already verified and add it to the new Azure AD. Learn more about [How to takeover a domain name verified in another tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/domains-admin-takeover).
2. When you try to sign-up for an new Azure offer for education or non-profit, and you get an error “tenant not found”, this may be related to the domain you are using for sign-up being verified in another tenant. In that case, you will need to takeover the tenant where the domain is already verified, with admin takeover or can proceed to add the domain with force takeover option in PowerShell. [Verifying domain name in PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/msonline/v1/confirm-msoldomain).
3. If you are trying to verify a sub-domain of an existing verified domain in another Azure AD with a different authentication type than the parent domain, you will need to remove it before proceeding to change the authentication type.  [Adding a sub-domain if root domain is already verified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-domains-manage-azure-portal#add-subdomains-of-a-custom-domain).

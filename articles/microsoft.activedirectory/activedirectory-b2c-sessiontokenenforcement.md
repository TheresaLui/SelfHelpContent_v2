# Session token configuration is not being enforced

If you use the "Sign-in" policy, your custom session token duration will not be enforced. The workaround is to use a combined "Sign in / Sign up" policy instead. This issue originates from the fact that the "Sign-up or Sign-in" policy leverages a newer and improved policy implementation compared to the older "Sign-in" policy.

# Problem with self-service sign up

## **Recommended steps**

* To use self-service sign up with your applications, you must first enable self-service sign up for your tenant. [Instructions to enable self-service sign up](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#enable-self-service-sign-up-for-your-tenant)
* To enable an application to support self-service sign up, you must add it to your user flow. When you next go to the login page for that application, you will see an option for ***No account? Create one!*** This starts the self-service sign up process. [Instructions to add applications to the self-service sign up user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#add-applications-to-the-self-service-sign-up-user-flow)

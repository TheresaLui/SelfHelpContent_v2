# Problem with self-service sign up

**Announcement** 
* [Deprecation of WebView sign-in support from Google starting January 4, 2021](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/google-federation#deprecation-of-webview-sign-in-support). Test whether your apps may be affected by following [Googleâ€™s guidance](https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/guidance-for-our-effort-to-block-less-secure-browser-and-apps.html) on testing compatibility
* Ensure to use system webview or system browser when signing in your users with consumer Google accounts
              

## **Recommended Steps**

* To use self-service sign up with your applications, you must first [enable self-service sign up for your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#enable-self-service-sign-up-for-your-tenant)
* To enable an application to support self-service sign up, you must [add it to your user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#add-applications-to-the-self-service-sign-up-user-flow). When you next go to the login page for that application, you will see an option for ***No account? Create one!*** This starts the self-service sign up process.

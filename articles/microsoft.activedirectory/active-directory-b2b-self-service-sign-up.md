# Problem with self-service sign up

## **Recommended Steps**

* To use self-service sign up with your applications, you must first [enable self-service sign up for your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#enable-self-service-sign-up-for-your-tenant)
* To enable an application to support self-service sign up, you must [add it to your user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow#add-applications-to-the-self-service-sign-up-user-flow). When you next go to the login page for that application, you will see an option for ***No account? Create one!*** This starts the self-service sign up process.

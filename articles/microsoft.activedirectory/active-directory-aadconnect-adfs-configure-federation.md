# I want to configure AD FS using Azure Active Directory Connect

Azure Active Directory Connect (Azure AD Connect) enables you to create federation between AD FS and Azure AD quickly in a few simple steps.

## **Recommended steps**
If you have AAD Connect already setup, and want to change your user sign-in method to AD FS, follow the instructions here to federate you Azure AD domain with AD FS using Azure AD Connect. [Changing the user sign-in method](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-user-signin#changing-the-user-sign-in-method)

If you are starting to configure Azure AD Connect, then follow the instructions for custom installation and configuring AD FS farm using AAD Connect.

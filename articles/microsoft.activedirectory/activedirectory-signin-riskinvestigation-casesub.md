# Risk Investigation (Alerts, Risks, and Reporting)

Your investigation into risk will typically start with the Identity Protection dashboard. The dashboard gives you access to:

* Reports such as [Users flagged for risk](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-user-at-risk), [Risk events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risk-events), and [Vulnerabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/vulnerabilities)
* Configuration settings for your Security [Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-sign-in-risk-policy), [Notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/notifications), and [multi-factor authentication registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-mfa-policy)

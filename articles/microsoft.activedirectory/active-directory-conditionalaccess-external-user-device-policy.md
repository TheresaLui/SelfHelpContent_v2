# Conditional Access Issue Preventing User Sign-In

<!--issueDescription-->

We have detected that a MAM or MDM policy applied to the sign-in associated with Correlation Id <!--$CorrelationId-->[CorrelationId]<!--/$CorrelationId--> coming from a guest/external user. MDM and MAM cannot be satisfied by guest/external users so such policies will always result in a block.

If you donâ€™t want external users to be blocked by your MAM or MDM policy, you should exclude guest users from the policy or require a grant control that they can satisfy, such as multi-factor authentication.

# B2B collaboration: Problem inviting the guest user

## **Recommended steps**
Use the **New Guest user** button in the **All users** to add guest users. Just enter their email address and optional message and select **Invite**.

You can also add new guest users directly to a group by using the "invite" option in the **Add member** experience for groups. You can add existing guest users to the group through the **Add member** experience without using the "invite" option.

You can also add new guest users directly to an application by using the "invite" option in the **Users and Groups @gt; Add user @gt; Users and Groups** experience for groups. You can add existing guest users to the group through the **Users and Groups @gt; Add user @gt; Users and Groups** experience without using the "invite" option.

If you are still unable to invite, please create a support ticket and let us know the details of the issue and we will be glad to help.<br>

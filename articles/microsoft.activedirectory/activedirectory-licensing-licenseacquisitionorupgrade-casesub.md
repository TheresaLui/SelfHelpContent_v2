# Acquire or upgrade licenses

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Is your problem related to per-user subscriptions (e.g. Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, Dynamics 365, etc.) or an Azure resource subscription (e.g. virtual machines, storage accounts)? For Azure resource subscription problems, make sure to open the support ticket under Subscription problems.
2. If you are using the Azure portal and want to know what Azure Active Directory edition you have in your tenant, make sure to check the Overview blade. The edition information is below the Directory name on the blade.
3. You can view your available products, including the individual licenses, by checking Licenses blade under Azure Active Directory in Azure portal
4. For specific information about each Azure Active Directory product edition and how to purchase/upgrade see [Azure Active Directory pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) page
5. To purchase licenses from Azure portal, click Try/Buy from All products blade in Licenses blade under Azure Active Directory in Azure portal

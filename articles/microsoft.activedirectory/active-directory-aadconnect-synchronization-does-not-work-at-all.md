# Synchronization does not work at all

## **Recommended Steps**

**Note**: If synchronization does not work at all, the most common issues are related to the accounts and their permissions that are used by the synchronization service, or the issue is related to an installation problem. For **installation issues with Azure AD Connect**, please go back to the previous page and select "I have a problem installing or uninstalling AADConnect" as the support sub-topic to see common solutions for installation issues. 

Note: if you are using a **deprecated version of sync, such as DirSync or AADSync**, please be ware that these versions **stop working on April 1st, 2021**. Please refer to [the docunmentation on Dirsync deprecation and how to upgrade to AADConnect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-dirsync-upgrade-get-started}

If you do not have an installation issue with Azure AD Connect sync, then please select a topic from the below to learn how to troubleshoot and resolve your issue.

### I am unable to start the Synchronization Service in Windows Service Control Manager

Common root causes include the following:

* The Azure AD Connect sync service account, which is used by the Synchronization Service as its security context, has its password changed recently. To resolve this issue, refer to [Changing the Azure AD Connect sync service account password](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-change-serviceacct-pass).
* The Azure AD Connect sync service account has not been granted [**Log on as a Service**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/log-on-as-a-service) rights
* The Azure AD Connect server is using **LocalDB** as its database, which has a 10GB limit. When using LocalDB and this limit is reached, the Synchronization Service can no longer start or synchronize properly. To recover from this issue, refer to [Azure AD Connect: How to recover from LocalDB 10-GB limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-recover-from-localdb-10gb-limit).

### I have a problem connecting my Azure AD Connect server to my domains or forests

If you see an error in the Azure AD Connect wizard when connecting to an AD forest, please go through following steps to troubleshoot and resolve it:

* Please check if you are running [latest version of AADConnect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-version-history). Recent builds of Azure AD Connect automatically run an AD connectivity troubleshooting script that will give more specific error details in the wizard. 
* You can run the AD connectivity troubleshooting script manually by opening a powershell command prompt and running `import-module C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect\Tools\ADConnectivityTool.psm1`, then calling `Start-ConnectivityValidation`. 
* When configuring an AD Forest, the Azure AD Connect wizard enumerates all the child domains under the selected forest. If there is an issue reaching any one of them, you may see this error: "The specified domain/forest either does not exist or could not be contacted". 
* This problem can occur if a domain controller in the domain has not registered an "A" record for itself in DNS. Resolution is to add the A record for the domain controller with the `ipconfig /registerdns` command. Flush the DNS cache on the computer running the Active Directory Installation Wizard with `ipconfig /flushdns`.
* You can use [Troubleshooting Active Directory Related DNS Problems](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727055%28v%3dtechnet.10%29) guide to troubleshoot DNS issues

### I have a problem connecting my Azure AD Connect server to a SQL server

If you see a problem related to the connectivity between your Azure AD Connect server and your SQL server, please follow the troubleshooting steps as described in [Troubleshooting SQL Server Connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-tshoot-sql-connectivity).

### I have a problem connecting my Azure AD Connect server to Azure AD

If you see a problem which may be related to the connectivity between your Azure AD Connect server and Azure AD, please follow the troubleshooting steps as described in [Troubleshooting Azure AD connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-connectivity). 

### I see a problem with Azure AD Connect sync cycle execution

The synchronization cycle has three steps: import, export, and synchronization. Import or export errors can lead to synchronization errors.

**Synchronization Issues**

* Use a [troubleshooting script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-objectsync) to troubleshoot object synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync

**Import Issues**

There can be several reasons why an object is not importing:

* **AD connectivity issues**: Please use [ADConnectivityTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-adconnectivitytools) to check connectivity issues with on premise AD
* **Azure AD connectivity issues**: Please follow instructions to [troubleshoot connectivity issues with Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-connectivity)
* **AD permissions issues**: As a best practice to avoid any permission issues, let Azure AD Connect [create accounts instead of providing custom accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-accounts-permissions)
* **Scoping issue**: The object belongs to a [domain or OU which is filtered out](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering) or there is sync rule to filter out the object

**Export Issues**

* **Data mismatch issue**: [Could not find mapping object](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sync-errors#data-mismatch-errors)
* **Duplicate attributes**: [Azure AD expects some attributes to be unique for each object](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sync-errors#duplicate-attributes)
* **Data validation failures**: [Azure Active Directory enforces various restrictions on the data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sync-errors#data-validation-failures)
* **Large object failures**: [Azure Active Directory restricts size limit for some attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sync-errors#largeobject)
* **Existing admin role conflict**: [Azure AD restricts some users from being synced if these users have already existin Azure AD and have an administrative roles assigned to them](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sync-errors#existing-admin-role-conflict)

**Other Issues**

* For advanced troubleshooting, [review how objects flow in AAD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-object-not-syncing)

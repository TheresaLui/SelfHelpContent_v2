# Problems with licensing

## **Recommended Steps**

**I don't understand the licensing requirements**

* Make sure you have a [valid license](https://www.azure.cn/pricing/details/active-directory/) for Azure AD Password Reset.

* Azure AD password reset is available in 3 tiers:

  * Azure AD Free - cloud administrations can reset their own passwords
  * Azure AD Basic or any Paid O365 Subscription - cloud users and cloud administrators can reset their own passwords
  * Azure AD Premium - any user or administrator (cloud, federated, password hash synced users) can reset passwords. Password writeback must be enabled to support some scenarios.

* Premium features are also included in:

    * Enterprise Mobility + Security E3
    * Enterprise Mobility + Security E5
    * Secure Productive Enterprise E3
    * Secure Productive Enterprise E5

# I can’t delete a user from my directory 

## **Recommended steps**

1. Ensure that you are authorized to delete a user. Only a global administrator or user administrator of Azure AD can delete a user. If you are not in one of these roles, you need to ask an administrator add you to one of these roles, or to delete the user for you.  [Azure AD administrative roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles)
2. Ensure that the user is not synced from your on-premises AD. If the user is synced (that is, if Source = ‘Windows Server AD’), then delete the user in your on-premises directory. Then after sync runs, you can see that the user has been deleted from Azure AD.

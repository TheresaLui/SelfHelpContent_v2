# Conditional Access Issue Preventing User Sign-In

<!--issueDescription-->

We have detected that a risk policy was applied and blocked the sign-in or MFA registration associated with Correlation Id <!--$CorrelationId-->[CorrelationId]<!--/$CorrelationId-->, which can impact expected workflow behavior.

# B2B collaboration: Can't add an invited user to the directory

## **Recommended steps**
Please use the **New Guest user** button in the "All users" to add guest users. Just enter their email address and optional message and select "Invite"<br>

You can also add new guest users directly to a group by using the "invite" option in the **Add member** experience for groups. You can add existing guest users to the group through the **Add member** experience without using the "invite" option.<br>

You can also add new guest users directly to an application by using the "invite" option in the **Users and Groups @gt; Add user @gt; Users and Groups** experience for groups. You can add existing guest users to the group through the **Users and Groups @gt; Add user @gt; Users and Groups** experience without using the "invite" option.<br>

If you are still unable to invite, please create a support ticket and let us know the details of the issue and we will be glad to help.<br>

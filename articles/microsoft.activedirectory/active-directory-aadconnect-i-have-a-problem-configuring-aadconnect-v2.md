### Problem with configuring attribute filtering
Configuring attribute filtering is an advanced feature. We strongly advise you review the **Recommended Documents** before making any changes to the synchronization rules. Any changes in filtering or scoping may result in the deletion of objects in your target directory.

After reviewing the recommended documents, follow the [instructions in this document to configure attribute filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering#attribute-based-filtering).

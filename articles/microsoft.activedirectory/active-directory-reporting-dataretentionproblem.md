# Azure AD sign-in Logs

## **Recommended steps**

* You can only see the last 30 days of data if you have an Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) license for your tenant. <br>
* Sign-ins are available only for Azure AD Premium tenants. It's not available for Free or Basic licensed tenants.

### **Troubleshooting issues with Sign-ins**

* If your tenant has a Premium P1 license and you can't see the sign-ins, check out our [latency information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-latencies) and file a support ticket if the delay exceeds the documented latency.

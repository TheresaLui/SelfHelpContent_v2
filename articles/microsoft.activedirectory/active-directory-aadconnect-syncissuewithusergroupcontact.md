# Synchronization issue with specific user, group or contact object

## **Recommended steps**

**Issue with synchronizing specific user, group or contact object**

If you have issues with synchronizing specific object:

  * Check for any synchronization error which corresponds to this object. For details on common synchronization errors, refer to article [Troubleshooting Errors during synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-troubleshoot-sync-errors). Synchronization errors are available to customers in the following ways:
  
    * Under Azure AD Connect Health [object-level sync error report](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync). This is currently available to selected customers only.
    
    * Identity synchronization error report - this is an email notification that is sent to the Technical Notification contact for the tenant whenever Azure AD Connect completes a synchronization cycle with errors.
    
    * Under the [Synchronization Service Manager Operation tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui-operations).
    
  * Check for duplicate attribute errors under [Duplicate Attributes Resiliency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsyncservice-duplicate-attribute-resiliency) feature.

  * If no error is found for this object, follow the troubleshooting steps described in article [Troubleshoot an object that is not synchronizing to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-object-not-syncing).

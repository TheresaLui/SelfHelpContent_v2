# Azure AD Sign-in logs

## **Recommended steps**

### **Troubleshooting download issues**

* If you don't see all the sign-ins for the date range you selected, please note that you can download up to 5000 rows (sorted by most recent) of sign-ins from Azure Portal.
* If you want to download more, you can use the "Script" option in the Sign-ins blade to download a PowerShell Script and run the same to get the results in .csv format

## **Recommended documents**

* [Sign-ins activities download](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins#download-sign-in-activities)

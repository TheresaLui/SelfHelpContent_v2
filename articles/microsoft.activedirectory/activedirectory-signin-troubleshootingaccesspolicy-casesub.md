# Troubleshooting conditional access policies in Azure Active Directory
To view a short video, see [Enable Azure Active Directory Conditional Access to secure user access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=eLAYBwjCGoA).

## **Recommended Steps**

Now that you have configured your conditional access policy, you probably want to know whether it works as expected. As a first step, use the conditional access [what-if policy tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/what-if-tool) to simulate a sign-in of your test user. The simulation estimates the impact this sign-in has on your policies and generates a simulation report.

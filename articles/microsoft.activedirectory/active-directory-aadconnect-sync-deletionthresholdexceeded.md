# Deletion threshold exceeded

## **Recommended steps**
If you have received an email notification or noticed error in **Synchronization Service Manager** UI, that the number of object deletions has exceeded the configured deletion threshold in Azure AD then this is **Azure AD Connect** feature to prevent any accidental deletes. Here are your options in this case:

* Please follow [instructions in this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes) to review the objects to be deleted or you can disable or exceed the threshold limit.

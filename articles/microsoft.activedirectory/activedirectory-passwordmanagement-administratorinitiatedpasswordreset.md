# I'm having problems resetting a user's password

## **Recommended steps**

**I'm having a problem resetting a user's password**

* Make sure you are authorized to reset passwords. *Only global, password, and user administrators can reset user passwords.* Global administrators can also reset other privileged administrator's passwords.

* Make sure you that you understand the licensing requirements:
  * You must have at least one license assigned in your organization
    * **Cloud only users** - Any Office 365 (O365) paid SKU, or Azure AD Basic
    * **Cloud and/or on-premises users** - Azure AD Premium P1 or P2, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), or Secure Productive Enterprise (SPE)
    * To read more about licensing requirements see the article [Licensing requirements for Azure AD self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-licensing)

* To reset a user's password, find the user in Azure AD. Then, on the overview blade for that user, click the "reset password" button

**The password reset button is greyed-out**

* You are not authorized to reset **this** user's passwords. *Only global, password, and user administrators can reset user passwords.* Global administrators can also reset other privileged administrator's passwords.

**I don't see the password reset blade**

* You are not authorized to reset passwords. *Only global, password, and user administrators can reset user passwords.* Global administrators can also reset other privileged administrator's passwords.

**I don't see the on-premises integration blade in password reset**

* The on-premises integration blade only appears in hybrid environments - meaning you are using password writeback to manipulate on-premises user's passwords.

* You do not see this blade if:
  * You are not using password writeback
  * There is a problem with your installation/connectivity of password writeback
  * There is a problem with your installation/connectivity of Azure AD Connect
  * For more troubleshooting steps for issues with password writeback see the section [Troubleshoot password writeback](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot#troubleshoot-password-writeback)

**I don't know how to reset a user's password**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal as an appropriate admin.
2. Go to the **Users and groups** blade, select **All Users**
3. Select a user from the list.
4. For the selected user, select **Overview**, and then in the command bar, select **Reset password**.
5. Select the **Reset password** button and follow the instructions on the screen.
   * Only resets performed through the **Azure portal** support password writeback.

**I reset an on-premises user's password from the Office 365 Admin portal or Office 365 mobile application but the user is still not able to sign in**

* Password Writeback is not supported in this portal. Reset the user's password again in the Azure portal - [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)

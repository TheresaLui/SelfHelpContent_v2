# Tip 4: DEPLOYMENT
## Use password reset to obviate the need to communicate temporary passwords
This is a tag-on to tip 3. Once you pre-configure your users for password reset, imagine a scenario where an employee joins your company for the first time. Instead of communicating the temporary password to him or her, you can now just have them navigate to the [Azure AD Password Reset Portal](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com) to reset their passwords.

If the user is using a [Windows 10 Azure AD Domain-joined device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azureadjoin-devices-group-policy), they can even do this right from the Windows 10 Out of Box sign in screen, allowing them to get access to a brand-new PC without you needing to lift a finger :).

To learn how to do this using an API, PowerShell, or Azure AD Connect, take a read of the documentation below. Once you pre-populate this data, just send your users to reset their passwords, and they can get into their accounts right away:

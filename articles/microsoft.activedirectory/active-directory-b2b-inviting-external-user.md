# Problem inviting an external user

**Announcement** 
* [Deprecation of WebView sign-in support from Google starting January 4, 2021](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/google-federation#deprecation-of-webview-sign-in-support). Test whether your apps are affected by following [Googleâ€™s guidance](https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/guidance-for-our-effort-to-block-less-secure-browser-and-apps.html) on testing compatibility
* Make sure to use the system webview or the system browser when signing in your users with consumer Google accounts

## **Recommended Steps**

* Make sure to send a user's invitation to the email address that matches the name that the user signs in with. If you send the invitation to a user's proxy email address, the user can't redeem it.

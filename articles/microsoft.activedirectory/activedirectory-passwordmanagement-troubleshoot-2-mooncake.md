# Problems with users registering for password reset

## **Recommended Steps**

**I want to pre-populate data for users so they don't have to register**

* Getting users to register security info can become long, drawn out campaigns.
* If you have good data on hand (from on-premises AD or HR applications) **you can set phone or email properties for your users** ahead of time and immediately roll out password reset to your entire organization! **And your users won't have to do anything**

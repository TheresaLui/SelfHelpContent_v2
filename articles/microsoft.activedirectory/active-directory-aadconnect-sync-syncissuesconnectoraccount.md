# Sync issues: Connector account

## **Recommended Steps**

Review the different [accounts and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-accounts-permissions) used by Azure AD Connect 

### **AD DS Connector account**

* This account is used to read/write information to Windows Server Active Directory
* [Changing the AD DS account password](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-change-addsacct-pass)
* **Permissions Issues:** A common issue is that this account does not have the [required permissions on AD DS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-configure-ad-ds-connector-account) 
* **Best Practice** is to allow the **Azure AD Connect** wizard to auto create this account during installation. Auto creating this account will ensure that [this account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-accounts-permissions) is configured with the required permissions.

### **Azure AD Connector account**

* This account is used to read/write information to Azure AD

* [Manage the Azure AD service account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-azureadaccount)
* **Best Practice** is to allow the Azure AD Connect wizard to create this account during installation
* There is a limit on the number of these accounts that can be created, which can sometimes be hit when installing/uninstalling Azure AD Connect multiple times. [Azure AD Connector account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-accounts-permissions) documentation explains how to address this by removing unused accounts.

# I can't assign licenses to a group

**Things to check first**
1. To manage licenses on groups, you must use an account with one of the required [administrator roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles): Global Administrator or User Administrator. You can check the userâ€™s role in the **Directory role** tab on the user blade.

2. If you are using the Azure portal and license assignment is failing, make sure to click the notification in the upper-right corner. This opens a blade with details about what went wrong. In most cases that is enough to understand and resolve the problem.

3. Assigning licenses to groups is currently in [preview](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/02/22/announcing-the-public-preview-of-azure-ad-group-based-license-management-for-office-365-and-more/); learn more about the limitations and known issues [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-advanced#limitations-and-known-issues). During preview, you will need an active subscription for Azure AD Basic (or above) - check if you have one by going to [Licenses/All products](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Products) in the Azure portal.

## **Recommended steps**
1. If you cannot assign a license to a group, check if the group is a "security group". Office 365 groups and distribution groups are currently not supported.

2. When a license is assigned or modified on a group it may take a while for the changes to be reflected on the users. To [confirm the status of license processing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-assignment-azure-portal#step-2-verify-that-the-initial-assignment-has-completed) vie the **Licenses** tab of the group.

3. [In certain situations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-group-problem-resolution-azure-portal) licenses cannot be assigned or removed from users. When investigating a problem with a user, make sure to go to the user's **Licenses** tab to view the complete information about their state; in most cases that is enough to understand the problem and solve it.

4. If you want to understand why a license was added/removed from a user or a group (e.g. who else in your organization may have made changes) make sure to view the [audit logs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Audit). Setting the filter to license activities will show all modifications including the "actor" that performed them.

5. PowerShell support for group-based licensing is currently limited, but some functionality is exposed via PowerShell v1.0 cmdlets. [See here for examples.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-licensing-ps-examples)

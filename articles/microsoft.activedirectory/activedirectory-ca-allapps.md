# Applying conditional access policy to 'all cloud apps'

Conditional access policy can be applied to all cloud applications. If policy is applied incorrectly, access to policy management can be blocked. It is best to roll out the policy to a small set of users.

## **Recommended steps**

*	When policy is applied to all clouds, make sure administrator accounts are excluded
*	Ensure policy behaves as expected before applying to administrator accounts

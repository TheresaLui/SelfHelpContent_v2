# Licensing questions about Azure AD features

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you are using the Azure portal and want to know what Azure Active Directory edition you have in your tenant, make sure to check the Overview blade. The edition information is below the Directory name on the blade.
2. You can view your available products, including the individual licenses, by checking Licenses blade under Azure Active Directory in Azure portal
3. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) comes in three editions: Free, Premium P1, and Premium P2. Details of the features included in each Azure AD edition can be found on the [Azure Active Directory pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) page.

There are several different features that make up self-service password reset, including change, reset, unlock, and writeback, that are available in the different editions of Azure Active Directory.

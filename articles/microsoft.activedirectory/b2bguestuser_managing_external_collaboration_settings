## **Recommended steps**
1.	Ensure that the user creating the administrative units and assigning roles is a global administrator or a privilege role administrator
2.	Make sure you are assigning users directly to the administrative units. Assigning a group to an administrative unit does not assign all the members of the group to the administrative unit.
3.	For a bulk operation performed on an administrative unit, the changes may take time to reflect in the UI depending on various factors such as current service load etc.

# Multi-Factor Authentication Issue Preventing User Sign-In

<!--issueDescription-->

Blocked users are detected in your tenant which can prevent users from receiving authentication requests. Any authentication attempts for blocked users are automatically denied. Users remain blocked for 90 days from the time that they are blocked.

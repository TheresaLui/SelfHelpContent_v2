# Problems configuring and signing in with Azure AD Pass-through Authentication

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you are configuring Pass-through Authentication for the first time, please ensure that you have reviewed the [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication), [quick start](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start), and [FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-faq) articles
2. Review [current limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-current-limitations) of Pass-through Authentication to ensure that you are not experiencing a known issue. As a workaround to such issues, enable Password Hash Synchronization on the [Optional features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom#optional-features) page in the Azure AD Connect wizard.
3. If you have security-related questions about Pass-through Authentication, read this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-security-deep-dive).
4. If you are planning to migrate from AD FS to Pass-through Authentication, review this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-user-signin) for comparison between the sign-in methods, and review this [FAQ entry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-faq#i-already-use-ad-fs-to-sign-in-to-azure-ad-how-do-i-switch-it-to-pass-through-authentication) for more details on how to do the migration
5. Before making any changes to your Pass-through Authentication configuration, add a cloud-only Global Administrator account to your tenant. Learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/add-users-azure-active-directory) on how to do so. This step ensures that you don't get locked out of your tenant.
6. If you have already configured Pass-through Authentication, please configure your tenant for [high availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-5-ensure-high-availability)

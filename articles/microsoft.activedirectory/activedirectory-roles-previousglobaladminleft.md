# Previous global administrator left the organization

## **Recommended steps**

* To see global administrators in your directory, go to the [Roles and administrators](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RolesAndAdministrators) page. Find the 'Global administrator' role in the list of roles. Open that page to see all of the global administrators in your directory.<br>
* If there are no names in the list, you can file a support ticket to initiate the process to assign a user as a global administrator.<br>
* If the only important resources associated with this Azure AD are in an Azure subscription, you can alternatively create a new Azure AD directory, create a new user in that directory, and assign ownership of the Azure subscription to the user in the new directory.

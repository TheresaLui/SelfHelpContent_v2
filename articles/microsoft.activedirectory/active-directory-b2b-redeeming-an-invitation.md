# Problem redeeming an invitation

## **Recommended Steps**

* For a guest user to access resources, the user must first explicitly [consent to participate in your directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/redemption-experience). The user can either accept the invitation that was sent by email or can access a URL that includes the ID of your tenant.
* Resend the invitation to a guest user. To resend the invitation, find the guest user in the [All users](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/AllUsers) blade. Click the user's name to open the user profile, and then click **Resend invitation** in the Identity section.
* If the guest user has an email address that is shared by both a Microsoft account and an Azure AD account, ensure the user accesses resources using the account context in which the user accepted the invitation. For new invitations to users with a Microsoft account and an Azure AD account which share an email address, the new B2B invitation is always accepted in the context of the Azure AD account.

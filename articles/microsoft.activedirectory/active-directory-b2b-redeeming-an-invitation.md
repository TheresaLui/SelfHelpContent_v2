# Problem redeeming an invitation

**Announcement** 
* [Deprecation of WebView sign-in support from Google starting January 4, 2021](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/google-federation#deprecation-of-webview-sign-in-support). Test whether your apps may be affected by following [Googleâ€™s guidance](https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/guidance-for-our-effort-to-block-less-secure-browser-and-apps.html) on testing compatibility
* Ensure to use system webview or system browser when signing in your users with consumer Google accounts


## **Recommended Steps**

* For a guest user to access resources, the user must first explicitly [consent to participate in your directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/redemption-experience). The user can either accept the invitation that was sent by email or can access a URL that includes the ID of your tenant.
* Resend the invitation to a guest user. To resend the invitation, find the guest user in the [All users](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/AllUsers) blade. Click the user's name to open the user profile, and then click **Resend invitation** in the Identity section.
* If the guest user has an email address that is shared by both a Microsoft account and an Azure AD account, ensure the user accesses resources using the account context in which the user accepted the invitation. For new invitations to users with a Microsoft account and an Azure AD account which share an email address, the new B2B invitation is always accepted in the context of the Azure AD account.

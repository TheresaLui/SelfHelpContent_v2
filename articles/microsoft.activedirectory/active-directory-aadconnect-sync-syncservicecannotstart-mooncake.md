# Cannot start Azure AD Connect Synchronization Service

## **Recommended steps**
You are unable to start the Synchronization Service in Windows Service Control Manager. Common root causes include the following:

* The Azure AD Connect sync service account, which is used by the Synchronization Service as its security context, has its password changed recently. To resolve this issue, refer to article [Changing the Azure AD Connect sync service account password](https://docs.azure.cn/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-change-serviceacct-pass).

* The Azure AD Connect sync service account is not granted **Logon as a Service** right. For more information on how to grant this right, refer to article [Log on as a service](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/log-on-as-a-service).
  <!--https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794944(v=ws.10).aspx-->
* The Azure AD Connect server is using **LocalDB** as its database, which has a 10-GB limit. When using LocalDB and this limit is reached, the Synchronization Service can no longer start or synchronize properly. To recover from this issue, follow the steps described in article [Azure AD Connect: How to recover from LocalDB 10-GB limit](https://docs.azure.cn/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-recover-from-localdb-10gb-limit).

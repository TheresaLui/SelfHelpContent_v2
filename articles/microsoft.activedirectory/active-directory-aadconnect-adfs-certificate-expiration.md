# Certificate Expiration




- If your certificate has expired, update your certificate through the [AD Connect tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-ssl-update).<br>
- For general certificate issues, use our [Diagnostics Analyzer](https://adfshelp.microsoft.com/DiagnosticsAnalyzer/Analyze) which provides a list of potential issues to help troubleshoot.<br>
- If you are unable to run the Diagnostics Analyzer:<br>
    *  Make sure that the certificate is trusted, as SSL certs need to be trusted by the clients and token signing certificates need to be trusted by relying parties.<br>
    * Check the trust chain, every certificate in the chain needs to be valid.
    * Check the certificate expiration date.<br>
    * Check certificate revocation list (CRL) accessibility, making sure the CDP field is populated.<br>
    * Finally, check to make sure the certificate has not been revoked.<br>

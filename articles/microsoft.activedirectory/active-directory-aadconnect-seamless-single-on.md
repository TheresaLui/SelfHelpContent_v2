# Problems configuring and signing in with Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-on

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you are configuring Seamless Single Sign-on for the first time, please ensure that you have reviewed the [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso), [quick start](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-quick-start), and [FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-faq). Please note that Seamless SSO works with Password Hash Synchronization and Pass-through Authentication, but not with AD FS.
2. Review [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-troubleshoot-sso#known-problems) of Seamless SSO
3. If you are experiencing single sign-on issues from an [Azure AD-joined device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction) instead of a domain-joined device, follow the troubleshooting guides under the **Devices** *problem type*. Learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-the-single-sign-on-experience-provided-by-azure-ad-joinactive-directory-azureadjoin-overviewmd-and-seamless-sso).
4. If you don't experience single sign-on and need to enter your username (but no password) instead, it is likely that the app you are signing into isn't forwarding the **domain_hint** or **whr** or **login_hint** parameter to Azure AD. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-faq#what-applications-take-advantage-of-domainhint-or-loginhint-parameter-capability-of-seamless-sso) is a list of apps that take advantage of these parameters.
5. If you have already configured Seamless SSO, ensure that you roll over its keys every 30 days. Learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-sso-faq#how-can-i-roll-over-the-kerberos-decryption-key-of-the-azureadssoacc-computer-account).

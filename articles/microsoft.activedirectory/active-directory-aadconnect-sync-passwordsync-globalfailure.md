# Password synchronization does not work – No passwords are synchronized

## **Recommended steps**
* Common root causes include:

  * The Active Directory account used by Azure AD Connect to communicate with on-premises Active Directory is not granted **Replicate Directory Changes** and **Replicate Directory Changes All** permissions, which are required for password synchronization.

  * Password synchronization is disabled after an administrator changed the User Sign-In method from **Password Synchronization** to another option such as **Federation with AD FS** in the Azure AD Connect wizard.

  * There is connectivity issue with on-premises Active Directory. For example, some domain controllers are not accessible by Azure AD Connect or [ports required](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-ports#table-1---azure-ad-connect-and-on-premises-ad) are blocked by Firewall.

  * The Azure AD Connect server is currently in staging mode.

* To troubleshoot the issue, follow the steps described in section [Troubleshoot password synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync - No passwords are synchronized](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-password-synchronization#no-passwords-are-synchronized).

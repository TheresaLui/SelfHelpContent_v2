# Problems with temporary passwords

## **Recommended Steps**

**I don't want to communicate temporary passwords to users**

Once you pre-configure your users for password reset, imagine a scenario where an employee joins your company for the first time. Instead of communicating the temporary password to him or her, you can now just have them navigate to the [Azure AD Password Reset Portal](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.cn/changepassword.aspx) to reset their passwords.

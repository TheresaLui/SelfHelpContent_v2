# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

Your investigation into risk will typically start with the Identity Protection dashboard. <br>
The dashboard gives you access to:
* Reports such as [Risky users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risky-users), [Risky sign-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risky-sign-ins), and [Risk detections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risk-detections)
* Configuration settings for your Security Policies, [Notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support), and [multi-factor authentication registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support)

In addition to investigation, you can configure an automated response for specific sign-in risk levels via the [sign-in risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/conditional-access-identity-protection-setup#to-create-a-conditional-access-policy). In your response, you can block access to your resources or require passing a [multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) to gain access.

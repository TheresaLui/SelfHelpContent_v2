# I want to assign an administrator role to a user

## **Recommended steps**

1. To assign a role to a user, open the user in Azure AD.

2. Select the directory roles in the left and then select the role or roles that the user needs to do their job:
	- To give the user full permission, assign the user to the **Global administrator** role.
	- To give the user permissions for a subset of actions in your directory, select **Limited administrator**, and then select the roles the user needs.
Â 
For information on what different roles can do, see the recommended documents.

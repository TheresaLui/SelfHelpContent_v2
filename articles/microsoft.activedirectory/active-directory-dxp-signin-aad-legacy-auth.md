# Sign In Failed due to Legacy Authentication

<!--issueDescription-->
Based on the information you provided the user <!--$userName-->[userName]<!--/$userName--> was trying to sign into Exchange Online and was not allowed to sign-in since the client attempted to authenticate using a legacy authentication protocol. 

Preventing legacy authentication sign-in is recommended as a best practice for security. Legacy authentication protocols like POP, SMTP, IMAP, and MAPI cannot enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) which makes them preferred entry points for adversaries to attack your organization.

The policy or policies below prevented the sign-in:

Quickly find out what happened or diagnose problems related to user sign-in by using the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom).  
Steps to use the diagnostic:

2. Find the event to analyze by entering in the details you have about the user, application, time of sign-in, request Id, or correlation Id.
3. Review the diagnostic results showing the details of what happened and what actions you can take to make changes (if any changes are needed).

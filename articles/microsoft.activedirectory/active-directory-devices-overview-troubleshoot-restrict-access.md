Yes, you can restrict access to the Azure AD administrtion portal to administrators.
Non-administrators will not be able to access any Azure AD data in the administration portal.

## **Recommended steps**

1. Navigate to Users & Groups -> User Settings
2. Select "Yes"
3. Save the settings

**Remarks**

You cannot limit the restiction to just Devices. It does not restrict such access using PowerShell or another client such as Visual Studio.

# Sign In Interrupted by Security Defaults

<!--issueDescription-->
Based on the information you provided the user <!--$userName-->[userName]<!--/$userName--> was trying to sign into Office 365 (preview) and was interrupted by Security Defaults. Security Defaults enforce best practice security for your organization and will require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to be configured and used in many scenarios to prevent password sprays, replay attacks and phishing attempts from being successful.

Review what the client submitted for the sign in and what happened during the authentication attempts below.

# Domain is verified in another Azure Active Directory tenant
<!--/issueDescription-->
Your domain name <!--$domain-->[domain]<!--/$domain--> is verified in another directory <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant-->.
<!--/issueDescription-->

A domain name can be verified in a single directory at a time. Since your domain name is currently verified in a different directory (using Office 365 or other Azure services), it cannot be verified in your current new directory until it is deleted on the other one.

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Delete the domain name](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-domains-manage-azure-portal) from your other directory <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant-->. You will need to be a global administrator in the other directory <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant--> to be able to delete the domain.

If you are not aware of the other directory that has this domain registered, please let us know.

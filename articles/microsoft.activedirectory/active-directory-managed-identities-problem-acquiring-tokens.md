# Problem acquiring tokens for the managed identity

To troubleshoot issues related to acquiring tokens for a managed identity, see the steps below:

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that the resource has been given a Managed Identity. Either system-assigned managed identity has been enabled or a user-assigned managed identity has been added. 
2. For user-assigned, ensure you're requesting the token for the correct identity. Provide client_id, object_id or mi_res_id as part of your token request to the local endpoint.

# Problems with users registering for password reset


## **Recommended steps**
**I want to pre-populate data for users so they don't have to register**
* Getting users to register security info can become long, drawn out campaigns.
* If you have good data on hand (from on-premises AD or HR applications) **you can set phone or email properties for your users** ahead of time and immediately roll out password reset to your entire organization! **And your users won't have to do anything**

To learn how to do this using an API, PowerShell, or Azure AD Connect, take a read of the documentation below:

* [Deploying password reset without requiring users to register](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-learn-more#deploying-password-reset-without-requiring-end-user-registration)

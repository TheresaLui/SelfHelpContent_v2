# Risk-based policies, notifications, and named locations

## **Recommended steps**

The [sign-in risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-sign-in-risk-policy) is an automated response you can configure for a specific sign-in risk level. In your response, you can block access to your resources or require passing a [multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-mfa-policy) to gain access.

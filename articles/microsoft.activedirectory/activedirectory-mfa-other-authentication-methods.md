# Authentication methods - Other (tokens, 3rd party)

## **Recommended Steps**  

You can quickly determine the issue or diagnose issues related to user sign-in by using the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom):

1. Launch the Sign-in Diagnostic.
2. Find the event to analyze by entering in the details you have about the user, application, time of sign-in, request ID, or correlation ID.
3. Review the diagnostic results showing the details of what happened and what actions you can take to make changes, if any changes are needed.

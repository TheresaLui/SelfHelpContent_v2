# Tip 6: WRITEBACK
## Ensure you enable the correct permissions, firewall rules, and connection settings for password writeback
In order for writeback to work correctly, you must ensure:

1. The proper **Active Directory permissions** have been set for users using the password writeback feature such that they have rights to modify their own passwords and account unlock flags in AD
2. The proper **firewall ports** have been opened to allow the password writeback service to communicate securely with the outside world using an outbound connection
3. The proper **firewall exceptions** have been made for key password reset service URLs, such as Service Bus
4. Your **proxy and firewall are not killing idle outbound connections**, we recommend 10 minutes or longer

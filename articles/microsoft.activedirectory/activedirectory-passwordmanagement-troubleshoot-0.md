# I don't think I have the right licenses

## **Recommended steps**

For Azure AD Password Reset to function, you must have at least once license assigned in your organization. We do not enforce per-user licensing on the password reset experience itself, however, if you make use of the feature without having a license assigned to a user, you will be considered out of compliance with your Microsoft licensing agreement and will need to assign licenses to those users.

*  Valid licenses to use Azure AD Self Service Password Reset:
    * Azure AD Premium 1
    * Azure AD Premium 2
    * Enterprise Mobility + Security E3
    * Enterprise Mobility + Security E5
    * Secure Productive Enterprise E3
    * Secure Productive Enterprise E5

The last word on Azure AD licensing (and always the most-recently-updated source) is the [Azure Active Directory Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

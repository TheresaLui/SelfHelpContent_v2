* Ocassionally, the provisioning configuration tutorials for slected applications may make recommendations or list known issues specific to those apps. For more information, find the tutorial specific to you applicaiton at  [Tutorials for integrating SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list).

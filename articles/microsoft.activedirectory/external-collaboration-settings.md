# External Collaboration Settings

## **Recommended Steps**

### Manage Invitation Settings 

Confirm that you have [configured the external collaboration settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/delegate-invitations) to allow the appropriate people to send invitations. 

 
### Manage Guest User Access Permissions 

1. Global admins can manage guest access permissions in the directory via the Azure portal by configuring the guest access permissions in the **External Collaboration Settings** page. Learn more about this setting [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions). 

2. If you would like your guests to access particular apps such as Teams or SharePoint, confirm that you have configured those apps to allow guest access as well. Learn more about the [Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/guest-access) and [Sharepoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview) settings.

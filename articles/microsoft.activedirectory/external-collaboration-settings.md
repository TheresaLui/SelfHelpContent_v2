* [Deprecation of WebView sign-in support from Google starting January 4, 2021](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/google-federation#deprecation-of-webview-sign-in-support). Test whether your apps are affected by following [Googleâ€™s guidance](https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/guidance-for-our-effort-to-block-less-secure-browser-and-apps.html) on testing compatibility

## **Recommended Steps**

### Manage Invitation Settings 

Confirm that you have [configured the external collaboration settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/delegate-invitations) to allow the appropriate people to send invitations. 
 
### Manage Guest User Access Permissions 

1. Global admins can manage guest access permissions in the directory through the Azure portal by configuring the guest access permissions on the **External Collaboration Settings** page. [Learn more about this setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions). 

2. If you would like your guests to access apps such as Teams or SharePoint, confirm that you've configured those apps to allow guest access. Learn more about the [Teams settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/guest-access) and [Sharepoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).

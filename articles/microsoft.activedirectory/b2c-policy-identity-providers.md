# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Can I add external identity providers to my user flows?** 
Yes, you can add identity providers that are supported by Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to your user flows in the Azure portal. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers).


### **Does Azure AD B2C allow users to sign in to my application with credentials from external social or enterprise identity providers (IdP)?**

Yes, Azure AD B2C supports external identity providers like Facebook, Microsoft account, Google, Twitter, and any identity provider that supports OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML protocols. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-identity-provider#select-an-identity-provider)

### **I need to customize behavior of my Azure Active Directory B2C tenant**

Custom policies are configuration files that define the behavior of your Azure AD B2C tenant. User flows are predefined in the Azure AD B2C portal for the most common identity tasks. Custom policies can be fully edited by an identity developer to complete many different tasks. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-overview)

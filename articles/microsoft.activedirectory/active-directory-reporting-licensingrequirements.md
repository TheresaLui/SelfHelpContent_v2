# Azure AD audit Logs

## **Recommended steps**

* Sign-ins are available only for Azure AD Premium tenants. They're not available for Bree or Basic licensed tenants.

### **Troubleshooting issues with Sign-ins**

* If you are a P1 tenant and can't see the sign-ins, check out our [latency information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-latencies) and file a support ticket if the delay exceeds the documented latency.

## **Recommended documents**

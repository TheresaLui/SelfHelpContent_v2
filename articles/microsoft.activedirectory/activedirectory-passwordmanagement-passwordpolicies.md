# I'm having problems with password policies
## **Recommended steps**

**I'm having problems with the password policy for a user**

* The password policy for a user depends on whether the user is cloud only or on-premises.
* Cloud only users must choose a password that meets the requirements in this article: [Password policies that only apply to cloud user accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#password-policies-that-only-apply-to-cloud-user-accounts)
* On-premises users must choose a password that meets the on-premises requirements. If an on-premises user is unable to set their password, check your on-premises requirements.

**I don't know how to set or check password expiration policies**

* You can set and check the expiration policy for cloud users in your tenant by using PowerShell. Follow the instructions in this article: [Set or check the password policies by using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#set-or-check-the-password-policies-by-using-powershell)
* The password expiration policy for on-premises users is set in your on-premises AD.

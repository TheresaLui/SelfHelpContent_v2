# I want to look at an event log to troubleshoot password writeback

## **Recommended Steps**

You can look at the Azure AD Connect Application Event log to troubleshoot password writeback. It contains a rich set of logging information that describes much of what is occurring with the password writeback service, in real time. To get access to this log, follow the steps below:

1. Sign in to on-premises computer that is running **Azure AD Connect**.
2. Open the **Windows Event Viewer** by pressing **Start** and typing in **"Event Viewer"**.
3. Open the **Application** event log.
4. Look for events from the following sources: **PasswordResetService** or **ADSync** to learn more about what issue may be occurring.

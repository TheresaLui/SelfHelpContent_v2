# Azure AD audit Logs

## **Recommended steps**

* Sign-ins are available only for Azure AD Premium-licensed tenants. It's not available for Free or Basic licensed tenants.<br>
* Audit and Sign-in logs are available only from the time you have configured the logs to be routed through Azure Monitor Diagnostics. There's no backfilling of the logs.

### **Troubleshooting issues with sign-ins**

If you are a P1 tenant and can't see the sign-ins within 15 mins in the destination you configured (Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace), file a support ticket.

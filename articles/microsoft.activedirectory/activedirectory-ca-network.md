# Problems configuring location-based conditional access

You can tie conditional access policies to the location of the client you have used to connect to Azure Active Directory. The follow options are available: <br>

*	Configure the [trusted IP ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-whats-next#trusted-ips) for your company, in Azure AD <br>
*	Use the ADFS [inside corpnet claim](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-adfs-cloud) to indicate the user is on the corporate network.

The location condition of a conditional access policy enables you to apply policy to locations that are not on a trusted network. You can do this by setting a policy condition that includes **All locations**, which means from anywhere, and exclude **All trusted IPs**.

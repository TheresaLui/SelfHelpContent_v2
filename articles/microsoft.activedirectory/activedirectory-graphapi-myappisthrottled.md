# My application is being throttled

Throttling limits the number of concurrent calls to a service to prevent overuse of resources. Microsoft Graph is designed to handle a very high volume of requests. In the event of an overwhelming number of requests, throttling helps maintain optimal performance and reliability of the Microsoft Graph service.

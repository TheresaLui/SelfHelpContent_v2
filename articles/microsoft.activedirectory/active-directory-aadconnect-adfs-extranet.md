# Problem with authentication ONLY from the extranet

## **Recommended Steps**

### All users can't sign-in using AD FS from an external network

Use this [troubleshooting guide](https://adfshelp.microsoft.com/TroubleshootingGuides/Workflow/1183c7fd-7489-4957-a30c-ab497ee85657) if users are not able to authenticate using AD FS from outside corpnet. This would usually include authentications occurring via the Web Application Proxy (WAP).

### The proxy trust between Web Application Proxy (WAP) and Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) server is broken

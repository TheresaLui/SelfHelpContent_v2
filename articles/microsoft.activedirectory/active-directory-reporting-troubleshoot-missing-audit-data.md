# I can’t find some actions that I performed in the Azure Active Directory activity log

## **Recommended steps**

Actions don’t appear immediately in the Activity audit log. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to see the audit logs in the Azure portal from the time the operation is performed.

- Wait for 15 minutes to an hour and see if the actions appear in the activity log.

# Recover RBAC when subscriptions are moved across tenants

## **Recommended steps**

If you transfer a subscription to a new Azure AD tenant, all role assignments in RBAC are permanently deleted from the source tenant and are not migrated to the target tenant. You must re-create the role assignments in the target tenant. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer)

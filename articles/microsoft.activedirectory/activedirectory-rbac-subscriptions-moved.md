# Recover RBAC when subscriptions are moved across tenants

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you need steps for how to transfer a subscription to a different Azure AD tenant, see [Transfer ownership of an Azure subscription to another account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer).
* If you transfer a subscription to a different Azure AD tenant, all role assignments are permanently deleted from the source Azure AD tenant and are not migrated to the target Azure AD tenant. You must re-create your role assignments in the target tenant.
* If you are a Azure AD Global Administrator and you don't have access to a subscription after it was moved between tenants, use the **Access management for Azure resources** toggle to temporarily [elevate your access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) to get access to the subscription.

# Domain is verified in an email-verified directory
<!--/issueDescription-->
Your domain name <!--$domain-->[domain]<!--/$domain--> is verified in another email verified tenant <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant-->. A domain name can be verified in a single directory at a time. The domain name is currently verified in a different directory (using Office 365 or other Azure services), it cannot be verified in your new directory until you perform internal or external takeover.
<!--/issueDescription-->

When a self-service user signs up for a cloud service that uses Azure AD, they are added to an unmanaged Azure AD directory based on their email domain. For more information about self-service or "viral" signup for a service, see [What is self-service signup for Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-signup)

## Recommended Steps

During the process of admin takeover, you can prove ownership as described in [Add a custom domain name to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/add-custom-domain). The next sections explain the admin experience in more detail, but here's a summary:

- When you perform an ["internal" admin takeover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/domains-admin-takeover#internal-admin-takeover) of an unmanaged Azure directory, you are added as the global administrator of the unmanaged directory. No users, domains, or service plans are migrated to any other directory you administer.

- When you perform an ["external" admin takeover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/domains-admin-takeover#external-admin-takeover) of an unmanaged Azure directory, you add the DNS domain name of the unmanaged directory to your managed Azure directory. When you add the domain name, a mapping of users to resources is created in your managed Azure directory so that users can continue to access services without interruption.

If you would like to delete the domain name from your other tenant <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant--> you can follow the instructions here on how to remove a domain name and its references. If you are not aware of the other directory that has this domain registered, please let us know.

To continue with deleting your domain name in the other tenant <!--$holdingTenant-->[holdingTenant]<!--/$holdingTenant--> proceed with the steps outlined in this article: [Delete a domain name and move it to another Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-domains-manage-azure-portal)

# Duplicate servers in the portal

## **Recommended steps**
1.	When an agent is uninstalled/removed from the server, the server is not automatically removed from the portal. Duplicate servers will occur, when a second agent is registered by a server with the same name/details.
2.	To delete a server from the portal, see [deleting a server or service instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health-operations#delete-a-server-or-service-instance)

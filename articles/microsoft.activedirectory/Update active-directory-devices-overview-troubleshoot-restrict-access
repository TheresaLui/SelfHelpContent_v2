# Can I restrict access to Devices in the Azure AD administration portal?

## **Recommended steps**

You can restrict access to Azure AD administation portal to administrators. 
Non-administrators will not be able to access any Azure AD data in the administration portal.

1. Navigate to Users & Groups -> User Settings
2. Select "Yes"
3. Save the settings

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot limit the restiction to just Devices.
> It does not restrict such access using PowerShell or another client such as Visual Studio.

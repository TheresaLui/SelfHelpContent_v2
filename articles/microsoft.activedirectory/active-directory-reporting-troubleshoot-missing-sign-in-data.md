# I can’t find recent user sign-ins in the Azure Active Directory sign-ins activity log

## **Recommended steps**

Sign-ins don’t appear immediately in the sign-ins activity log. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours to see the sign-in logs in the Azure portal. For some sign-ins activity data coming from legacy office applications, it can take to 8 hours for the reporting data to show up.

* Wait for 15 minutes to 2 hours and see if the actions appear for non-legacy sign-ins.

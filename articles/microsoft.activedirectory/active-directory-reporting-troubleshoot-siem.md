# I can't integrate Azure AD activity logs with my SIEM system

## **Recommended steps**

There are two supported methods to accomplish this task:

- You can use Azure Monitor Event Hub to stream logs into your SIEM. Use the following steps to complete this task:
  - Go to Activity Logs > Sign-ins > Export Data Settings
  - Configure the logs you want to route and select the Event hub it should be routed to
  - [Setup your SIEM tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub#access-data-from-your-event-hub) with the configured Event hub
- You can use the Reporting Graph API to get the data, and then push it into your SIEM tool using your own scripts

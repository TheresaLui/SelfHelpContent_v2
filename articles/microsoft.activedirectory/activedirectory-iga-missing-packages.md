# Why aren't access packages showing up in a user's MyAccess portal?


## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the Azure portal, open the access package and then click **Policies**.
2. Ensure that you have a policy that includes the user. The user should be selected or be in a selected group or directory.
3. In the **Policy details** pane for this policy, ensure the **Enabled** property is set to**Yes**.
4. Click **Overview** for the access package and ensure the **Hidden** property is set to **No**.
5. Open the catalog the access package is in, click **Overview** and ensure the **Enabled** property is set to **Yes**.
6. If the user is an external user, ensure the **Externally visible** property for the catalog is set to **Yes**.

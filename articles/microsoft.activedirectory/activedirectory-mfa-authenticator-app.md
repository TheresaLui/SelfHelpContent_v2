# Authentication methods - Authenticator App

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If a user is not getting a push notification in the Microsoft Authenticator app, please verify they are not shown under the MFA blocked users as described here: [Block and unblock users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#block-and-unblock-users).

2. If the user is not blocked for MFA but does not receive a push notification, they can open the Microsoft Authenticator app, which will pull the pending approval requests.	

3. The user can also click on **Sign in another way** and choose **use a verification code from my mobile app** as an alternative method to sign-in.

# How to migrate Azure AD Connect from LocalDB to full SQL

## **Recommended steps**
You cannot directly replace the LocalDB of an existing Azure AD Connect deployment with the database of the full version of SQL. Instead, you must deploy a new Azure AD Connect server with the full version of SQL. It is recommended that you do a swing migration where the new Azure AD Connect server (with SQL DB) is deployed as a staging server, next to the existing Azure AD Connect server (with LocalDB). 

* For instruction on how to configure remote SQL with Azure AD Connect, refer to article [Custom installation of Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom).

* For instructions on swing migration for Azure AD Connect upgrade, refer to article [Azure AD Connect: Upgrade from a previous version to the latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-upgrade-previous-version#swing-migration).

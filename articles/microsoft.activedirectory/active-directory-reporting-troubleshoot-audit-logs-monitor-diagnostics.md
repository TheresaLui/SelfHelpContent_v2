# I don’t see the Sign-in Data streaming even though I have configured it through Azure Monitor Diagnostics

## **Recommended steps**

You configured the Azure AD Logs through Diagnostics settings (using “Export Data”) in the Azure Active Directory > Activity Logs > Audit. Now you can't see the sign-ins either in Storage account or Event hub. 

Even though you can see the **SignIn** check box and select that option through the **Audit logs** > **Diagnostics Settings** blade, the sign-in logs aren't streamed to your storage account or Event hub (based on your configuration) unless you at least have one Azure AD Premium 1 license associated with your tenant. Because the **All Sign-ins** report is available only for P1 customers, you won’t be able to stream it.

Resolution: [Start a free trial for Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) and check out this feature.

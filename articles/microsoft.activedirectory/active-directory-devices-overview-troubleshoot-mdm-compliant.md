# Why is there no MDM or Compliant status on my device?

If a device has been enrolled for device management, MDM (Mobile Device Management) is updated with the management owner. 

If a device is enrolled, the compliant status is updated by the management owner.

Device that Hybrid Azure AD joined and managed by SCCM will have a compliant status without a management owner.

The compliant status is marked as N/A in all other conditions not stated above.

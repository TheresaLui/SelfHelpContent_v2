# API or UI Timeout

### Symptom

Customer claims that they often experience a few minutes of outage where they cannot load their notebooks or access databricks services from CLI/API.

```
HTTP ERROR: 500                                
Problem accessing /. Reason:                              
com.google.common.util.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException: com.databricks.common.jetty.client.ServiceUnavailableException: TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE: Service is unavailable      
```

Or the message 'Connecting ...' constantly shows up in the top left corner.

### Troubleshooting & Solution


- Check if there are any customer implemented network firewalls or blocked websockets
- This exception is raised if webapp service becomes unavailable, so this is expected during weekly shard maintenance. Please refer [here](https://status.azuredatabricks.net) for any maintenace notification. 
- This is expected if there is any service outages with any Databricks or Azure services outages. Please refer to [databricks](https://status.azuredatabricks.net) and [azure](https://status.azure.com/en-gb/status) status pages.
- Look for API call from browser and get the exact error that the API returns
- Collect HAR logs for issue repro

# Databricks UI Slowness

### Symptom

Customer experiencing general slowness when using databricks UI causing bad user experience and affects their development cycles.  

### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure there is no customer firewall or proxy on the local machine that is slowing down the connection
2. Identify the exact API fired from the client end by collecting HAR logs:   

* Developer Console - Browser Tab
* Open Google Chrome and go to the page where the issue is occurring               
* From the Chrome menu bar, select View > Developer > Developer Tools              
* From the panel opened at the bottom of your screen, select the Network tab               
* Look for a round Record button in the upper left corner of the Network tab, and make sure it is red. If it is grey, click it once to start recording.                
* Check the box next to Preserve log                
* Click the Clear button to clear out any existing logs from the Network tab             
* Now try to reproduce the issue that you were experiencing before while the network requests are being recorded                
* Once you have reproduced the issue, right click anywhere on the grid of network requests, select Save as HAR with Content, and save the file.               
* Use tools like [HAR analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/) to analyze and identify the exact API and the time it took for each request.            

3. Check if there is any ongoing issue with identified API

# Unable to launch workspace

### Symptom

Worspace not able to launch after deployment is successful - `Unable to launch workspace`.


### Troubleshooting

1. How was workspace deployed - Portal or ARM? Is the ARM template correct or missing any attributes? 

2. Workspace mode - VNET injected or NPIP or Default?

3. Are they redeploying workspace using same workspace name or storage name of deleted workspace? 

4. Are they deploying multiple workspaces using the same subnets? 

5. Does the user have owner/contributor access to the workspace? 

### Solution

- Try to launch workspace after deploying it using [this all-in-one template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-databricks-all-in-one-template-for-vnet-injection). If it works fine, then the template customer is using or deployment is wrong. 
- Reusing deleted workspace and storage names is not recommended. Use new names for new deployments.
- IP Clash can happen if same subnets are shared across multiple workspaces. Make sure to use different subnets for workspaces.


### Next Steps

Ask SME for further assistance on Ava and create a Databricks Salesforce ticket if needed.

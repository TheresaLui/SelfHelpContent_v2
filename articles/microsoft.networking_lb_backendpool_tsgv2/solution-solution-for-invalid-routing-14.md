# Solution for invalid routing

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear <Customer>,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. We have reached a point in the troubleshooting process where we need additional information to further diagnose the connectivity issue. Please perform a traceroute from an allowed source host to the VIP for this load balancer and copy/paste the output. Please gather a packet capture on the source and destination VM simultaneously while reproducing the issue and send both files to us. This will help us determine the appropriate next steps for this case.

Best regards,

<!--/issueDescription-->

# Solution - Customer VIP under DDoS Mitigation

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear <Customer>,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. We have reviewed diagnostics and configuration available to us. We observed that at the time of your report of connectivity issues your VIP <VIP> was under DDoS attack mitigation to protect your backend pool as well as the Azure infrastructure.

If you would like DDoS metrics and alerts, mitigation reports, mitigation flow logs, and mitigation policies tuned for your application, please consider enrolling your Azure tenant in a Standard DDoS Protection plan if you have not already done so. For more information, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview. Please note that this feature set incurs and additional monthly charge.

If you need additional support on this matter, please let us know.  

Best regards,

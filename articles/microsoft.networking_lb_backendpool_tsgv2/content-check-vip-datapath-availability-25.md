# Check VIP datapath availability

If there are no DIP health failures, check the VIP data path availability. This data is generated by the VIP prober which is part of the SLB infrastructure.

## Recommended Steps
1. In ASC, browse to the Diagnostics tab of the relevant load balancer and scroll down to &quot;VIP Availability&quot;. Click on the link for the relevant frontend IP and port. This will open a new tab with the VipAvailability_DataPathAvailability with the parameters filled out. Adjust the time parameter of the dashboard. Be sure to note time zones to ensure you are look at the right point in time. 
2. On the top set of charts under &quot;Data Path Availability (VipAvailability),&quot; look to see if there are any dips in VipAvailability and if so, see if there are any increases in FailureCount.

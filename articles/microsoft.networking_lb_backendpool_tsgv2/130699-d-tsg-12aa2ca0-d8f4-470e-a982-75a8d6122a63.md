# Check Scope

Verify the customer issue is a match for this troubleshooting checklist and guide. This is a load balancer connectivity troubleshooting guide, not an operation failure troubleshooting guide (such as unable to delete load balancer). If you need assistance with troubleshooting failed load balancer operations, consult your TA (an interactive troubleshooting checklist and guide has not yet been developed for this scenario).

# Gather more information on globally peered Vnet to standard SKU load balancers.

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear <Customer>,

Thank you for contacting us about your load balancer backend pool connectivity issue. We have reached a point in the troubleshooting process where we need additional information to further diagnose the connectivity issue. Please gather a packet capture on the source VM and the VMs in your backend pool simultaneously while reproducing the issue. Then send the set of files to us. This will help us determine the appropriate next steps for this case.

Best regards,

<!--/issueDescription-->

# Start: Check Scope

Verify the customer issue is a match for this ***Azure Load Balancer V1\Connectivity-Inbound\Cannot connect to Backend Pool*** troubleshooting guide. Note: this is a connectivity troubleshooting guide, not an operation failure troubleshooting guide. Ensure that the customer has identified the load balancer resource URI, the client IP address (or VM resource URI), whether or not the issue is currently happening, or if they need assistance with an intermittent connectivity issue and if so, the date and time with time zone of when the issue occurred.

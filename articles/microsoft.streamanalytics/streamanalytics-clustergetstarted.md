# Get started with Stream Analytics cluster

Stream Analytics clusters are powered by the same engine that powers Stream Analytics jobs running in a multi-tenant environment. The single tenant, dedicated cluster have the following features:

* Single tenant hosting with no noise from other tenants. Your resources are truly "isolated" and performs better when there are burst in traffic.

* Scale your cluster between 36 to 216 SUs as your streaming usage increases over time.

* VNet support that allows your Stream Analytics jobs to connect to other resources securely using private endpoints.

* Ability to author C# user-defined functions and custom deserializers in any region.

* Zero maintenance cost allowing you to focus your effort on building real-time analytics solutions.

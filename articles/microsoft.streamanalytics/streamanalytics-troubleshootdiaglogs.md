# Troubleshoot using Diagnostic Logs
Occasionally, an Azure Stream Analytics job unexpectedly stops processing. It's important to be able to troubleshoot this kind of event. The event might be caused by an unexpected query result, by connectivity to devices, or by an unexpected service outage. The diagnostics logs in Stream Analytics can help you identify the cause of issues when they occur, and reduce recovery time. To learn more, see the recommended documents.

# Delete Stream Analytics cluster

Stream Analytics clusters are powered by the same engine that powers Stream Analytics jobs running in a multi-tenant environment. Deleting clusters might take a while. However, you will stop getting charged for your cluster the moment the delete operation is initiated. 

Cluster cannot be deleted unless all jobs are stopped and removed from the cluster.

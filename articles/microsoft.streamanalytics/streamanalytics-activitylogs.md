# Activity Logs in Stream Analytics

Activity logs are on by default and give insights into the operations performed on the job. You can see the list of operations by opening the activity logs blade on Azure portal. These logs are maintained only for 30 days after which it gets deleted. Therefore you can use these logs to understand activity on your job for the last 30 days.

To learn more about activity logs, see the recommended documents.

# Event ordering in Stream Analytics
Late arrival policy and out of order policy can be configured by selecting 'Event ordering' under Configure on the Azure portal. These settings are applied only when your query has the TIMESTAMP BY clause.

When you are setting up your streaming pipeline, you should account for events that are arriving late or out of order. Consider latency and correctness requirements for your scenario when configuring these settings. Optimizing for data correctness will impact latency and vice versa.

To learn how these settings work and how to configure them, please see these recommended documents.

# Alerting
The Azure portal both surfaces key performance metrics that can be used to monitor and allows you to troubleshoot your query and job performance. It is important to note that these alerts will fire only when the conditions have been met. For example, you can measure a metric's average value of over the last 15 minutes, every 5 minutes. If your alerts did not fire, please ensure your conditions are defined correctly.

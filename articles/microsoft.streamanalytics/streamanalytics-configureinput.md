# Configure Input

Stream Analytics has first-class integration with Azure data streams as inputs from Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Blob Storage. Azure Stream Analytics also supports reference data (also known as lookup table) which is a finite data set that is static or slowly changing in nature, used to perform a lookup or to correlate with your data stream. To learn more about configuring inputs in Azure Stream Analytics job, see the recommended documents.

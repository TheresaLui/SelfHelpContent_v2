# Job Diagram
The job diagram on the Monitoring blade in the Azure portal can help you visualize your job pipeline. It shows inputs, outputs, and query steps. You can use the job diagram to examine the metrics for each step, to more quickly isolate the source of a problem when you troubleshoot issues. To learn more, see the recommended documents.

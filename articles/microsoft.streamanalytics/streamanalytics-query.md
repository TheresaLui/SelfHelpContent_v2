# Develop Query
Queries in Azure Stream Analytics are expressed in a SQL-like query language. The query design can express simple pass-through logic to move event data from one input stream into another output data store. Or it can do rich pattern matching and temporal analysis to calculate aggregates over various time windows. You can join data from multiple inputs to combine streaming events, and do lookups against static reference data to enrich the event values. To learn more about authoring queries in Azure Stream Analytics job, see the following documentation:

# Error in Portal
Errors that you see on the Azure portal could be transient in nature. Stream Analytics will automatically retry and try to recover from such errors. Other errors result in job failures. Failures can be caused by an unexpected query result, by connectivity to devices, or by an unexpected service outage. The activity and diagnostics logs in Stream Analytics can help you identify the cause of issues.

To learn more about how to debug using logs, see the recommended documents.

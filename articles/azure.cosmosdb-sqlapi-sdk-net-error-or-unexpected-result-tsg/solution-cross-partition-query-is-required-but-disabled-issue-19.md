# Cross partition query is required but disabled issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

If your data was previously distributed using a single partition your queries may have worked even though *EnableCrossPartitionQuery = false*. If your data is now distributed across more than one partition, please enable the crossPartitionQuery by setting enableCrossPartitionQuery=true through code as shown below to resolve the issue.  
`var option = new FeedOptions { EnableCrossPartitionQuery = true };`  

Thank you.

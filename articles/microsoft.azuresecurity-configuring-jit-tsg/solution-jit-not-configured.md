# JIT Policy doesnt seem to be configured

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear Customer,<br>

The user probably does not have authorization to perform the needed action.<br>
<br>
Check that the role assignment contains this action:<br>
 'Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/write' over scope subscriptions/jitNetworkAccessPolicies.<br>
<br>
The user should have the RBAC role to contain the above actions (Contributor or Owner) as described here in the article [Understanding just-in-time virtual machine access in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/just-in-time-explained)
Best Regards,<br>

Based on provided information and investigation, we need to use Storage logging to collect more detailed data and to analyze a problem in depth. The diagnostics information we obtain from both monitoring and logging will help to determine the root cause of the issue and we can further troubleshoot it with Storage team to determine the appropriate steps to remediate it. 

Please enable diagnostics logging for Storage (if not enabled already), reproduce the issue, and collect the logs accordingly.

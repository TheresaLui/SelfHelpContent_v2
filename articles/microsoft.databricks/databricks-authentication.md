# Azure Databricks User Authentication and Management

## **Recommended steps**

- The admin console is where you can manage access controls. Find the admin console with the person icon on the top right of your workspace.
- If you see an error that your account has not been registered in Databricks, then you need to ask the owner of the workspace to add you as a user.
- If you still see the same error, go to the Azure portal and select Initialize Workspace to try again.

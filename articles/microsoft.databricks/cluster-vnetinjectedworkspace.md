* You can use an Azure Firewall to create a VNet-injected workspace in which all clusters have a single IP outbound address. The single IP address can be used as an additional security layer with other Azure services and applications that allow access based on specific IP addresses: [How to Assign a Single Public IP for VNet-Injected Workspaces Using Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/cloud/azure-vnet-single-ip)

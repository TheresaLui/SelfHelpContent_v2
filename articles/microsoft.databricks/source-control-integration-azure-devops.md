# Diagnose and resolve issues with source control integration – Azure DevOps 

## **Recommended Steps** 

* **Git Sync failure: 403 access denied** - Validate Git token configured on Databricks .

* **Git Sync failure: Error while syncing Git history: Could not authenticate using AAD token: FailureNoIdentityProviderCredential** - This error usually return from AAD side where authentication fails before syncing to git server .

* **Error linking with Git: Unexpected character ('<' (code 60)): expected a valid value (number, String, array, object, 'true', 'false' or 'null')? at [Source: ????<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC …** - This error is due to known issue where your Databricks and DevOps are in different AAD tenants, which fails the passthrough sign in and blocks them from using the feature altogether. As of now this feature is not supported. As a work around please follow the steps in [this blog](https://thedataguy.blog/ci-cd-with-databricks-and-azure-devops/ ).

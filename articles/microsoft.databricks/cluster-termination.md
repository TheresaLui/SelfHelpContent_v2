# Diagnose and resolve issues with Databricks cluster termination

## **Recommended Steps**

> Check [Azure Databricks status page](https://status.azuredatabricks.net/) for current status by region. We highly recommend subscribing for updates on this page, which will automatically notify you of future status changes.

* **By design, clusters that are idle for 30 days will be automatically deleted.** To prevent this deletion after 30 days idle time, make sure to [pin the cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/databricks/clusters/clusters-manage#--pin-a-cluster).
    
* [How to set Automatic termination](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/clusters/clusters-manage#automatic-termination). 

 * For details about who deleted the cluster, check the [cluster event log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/clusters/clusters-manage#--cluster-event-logs).

* **Is is possible to restore a cluster?**
  
  If cluster is deleted, it cannot be restored by design. Instead, a new cluster should be created.

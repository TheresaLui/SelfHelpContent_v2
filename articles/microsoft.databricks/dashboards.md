# Dashboards

## **Recommended steps**

Below are details on how to setup a dashboard for your notebook.  

* Note: Dashboards do not live refresh when you present them from the dashboard view. To schedule a dashboard to refresh at a specific interval, [schedule](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/notebook-manage.html#schedule-notebook) the notebook that generates the dashboard graphs.  
* You can [create](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/dashboards.html#dashboards) a dashboard from an Azure Databricks notebook.  
* Once you have created a dashboard, you can also organize the dashboard. 
* You can also [view](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/dashboards.html#view-a-specific-dashboard-version) a specific dashboard version.

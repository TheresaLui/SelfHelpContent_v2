# Diagnose and resolve issues with Workspace Migration   

## **Recommended Steps**  

* Learn how to [migrate Azure Databricks workspace between subscriptions or regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/scenarios/howto-regional-disaster-recovery#detailed-migration-steps). Create the new workspace first, and then migrate all notebooks, jobs configuration, clusters configuration, users, libraries, mounts, and init scripts.   

* Learn how to [migrate production jobs from Apache Spark on other platforms to Apache Spark on Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/migration/production).

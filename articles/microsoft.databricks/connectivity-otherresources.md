# Diagnose and resolve connectivity issues

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Azure Event Hubs + Apache Spark connector** is updated regularly, and a more recent version may be available. We recommend that you [pull the latest connector from the Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-eventhubs-spark).

* If the IP Access List feature is enabled for the workspace, make sure to provide assignment permissions to Azure Data Factory IPs so that you can run notebooks from ADF:

  - To update the IP access list or create a new one with a new CIDR, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/security/network/ip-access-list)
  - For CIDRs that need assignment permissions, see [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud]( https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519), and search for *DataFactory.Region*

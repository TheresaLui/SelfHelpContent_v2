* If you are unable to launch or access Azure Databricks workspace due to error "User does not have Contributor or Owner role", the issue is by design. Enable access to users by modifying IAM roles and assign **Contributor** or **Owner** role following steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/account-settings/account#--assign-account-admins). User should be added **individually** as adding AD group is *not supported* yet.

# Diagnose and resolve issues with Workspace launch failure in VNET injected workspace

## **Recommended Steps**

* Login issue getting error: 
  
  ```
  Weâ€™ve encountered an error logging you in. Databricks support has been alerted and will begin looking into the issue right away. 
  ```
  A workaround would be to either open a new tab in google chrome or close the browser and erase its history.

  If this doesn't help, there would be an ongoing maintenance or outages. Please check [Databricks status page](https://status.azuredatabricks.net/) to confirm.

* If you are unable to launch or access Azure Databricks workspace due to error "User does not have Contributor or Owner role", the issue is by design. Enable access to users by modifying IAM roles and assign **Contributor** or **Owner** role following steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/account-settings/account#--assign-account-admins). User should be added **individually** as adding AD group is *not supported* yet.

# Diagnose and resolve issues with connectivity to Databricks cluster

## **Recommended Documents**

* Review [Azure Databricks Status Page](https://status.azuredatabricks.net/) for current status by region and to subscribe for updates on status changes
* You can use an Azure Firewall to create a VNet-injected workspace in which all clusters have a single IP outbound address. The single IP address can be used as an additional security layer with other Azure services and applications that allow access based on specific IP addresses: [How to Assign a Single Public IP for VNet-Injected Workspaces Using Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/cloud/azure-vnet-single-ip)
* You can get the public/private IP address of your [driver or executor node(s)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/clusters#--sparknode) by running this command in a notebook:

	%sh
	curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/network?api-version=2017-08-01"

* [Error: Instances unreachable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/clusters/cluster-failed-launch#instances-unreachable)
* [Troubleshooting JDBC and ODBC Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/bi/jdbc-odbc-troubleshooting)

# Diagnose and resolve issues with connectivity to Databricks cluster

## **Recommended Documents**

* If your Azure Databricks workspace is deployed to your own virtual network (VNet), you can use custom routes, also known as user-defined routes (UDR), to ensure that network traffic is routed correctly for your workspace. For example, if you connect the virtual network to your on-premises network, traffic may be routed through the on-premises network and unable to reach the Azure Databricks control plane. User-defined routes can solve that problem: [User-Defined Route Settings for Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/udr)

# Diagnose and resolve issues with Workspace deletion

## **Recommended Steps**

* Steps to delete workspace:
     * Login to portal and navigate to Databricks Workspace that needs to be deleted
     * Click on Managed Resource Group 
     * Click 'delete' to delete Managed Resource Group, after confirming there are no [locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources#managed-applications-and-locks)
     * Once Managed Resource group deletion is successful, proceed with deleting workspace
     
     
* Cleanup of workspace is an asynchronous process and takes about 5-10 minutes to clean up cluster resources like VNET, Virtual Machines, storage and NSG.  If you just initiated it, please check after 5-10 minutes.

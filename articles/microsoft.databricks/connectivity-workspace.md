# Diagnose and resolve issues with connectivity to Workspace

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Instances unreachable](https://kb.azuredatabricks.net/clusters/cluster-failed-launch.html#instances-unreachable)
* [Virtual Network Peering](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-peering.html)
* By default, all users can create and modify workspace objects. However, if administrator enables workspace access control, individual permissions determine a userâ€™s abilities. Workspace Access Control is only available in the Premium SKU. Enabling Workspace Access Control will allow users to control who can view, edit, and run notebooks in their workspace. 
If you have this enabled, please give the required permissions as needed: [Workspace Permissions](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/administration-guide/admin-settings/workspace-acl.html#workspace-permissions)

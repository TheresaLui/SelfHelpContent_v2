# Diagnose and resolve issues with Databricks cluster creation, termination, or sizing

## **Recommended Steps**

Below are details on how to setup, terminate and change the size of a Azure Databricks cluster.  

* You can create and manage clusters using the [UI](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/clusters/create.html), [Databricks CLI](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/dev-tools/databricks-cli.html#databricks-cli), and by invoking the [clusters API](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/api/latest/clusters.html#cluster-api)
* The [size of the cluster](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/clusters/sizing.html) is initially set when the cluster is created. You can either provide a fixed number of workers for the cluster or provide a minimum and maximum number of workers for the cluster to enable autoscaling. You can change the size of the cluster after it is created by editing the cluster configuration.  
* You can manually [terminate a cluster](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/clusters/terminate.html), or configure the cluster to automatically terminate after a specified period of inactivity
* When you terminate a cluster, the terminated cluster cannot run notebooks or jobs, but its configuration is stored so that it can be reused at a later point in time

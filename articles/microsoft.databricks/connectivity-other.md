# Diagnose and resolve connectivity issues

* If your Azure Databricks workspace is deployed to your own virtual network (VNet), you can use custom routes, also known as user-defined routes (UDR), to ensure that network traffic is routed correctly for your workspace. For example, if you connect the virtual network to your on-premises network, traffic may be routed through the on-premises network and unable to reach the Azure Databricks control plane. Please use [User-defined routes](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/udr.html) to solve this problem.

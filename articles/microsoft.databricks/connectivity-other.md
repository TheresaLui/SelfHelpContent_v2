# Diagnose and resolve connectivity issues

* If your Azure Databricks workspace is deployed to your own virtual network (VNet), you can use custom routes, also known as user-defined routes (UDR), to ensure that network traffic is routed correctly for your workspace. For example, if you connect the virtual network to your on-premises network, traffic may be routed through the on-premises network and unable to reach the Azure Databricks control plane. Please use [User-defined routes](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/udr.html) to solve this problem.
* * You can use an Azure Firewall to create a VNet-injected workspace in which all clusters have a single IP outbound address. The single IP address can be used as an additional security layer with other Azure services and applications that allow access based on specific IP addresses: [How to Assign a Single Public IP for VNet-Injected Workspaces Using Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/cloud/azure-vnet-single-ip)

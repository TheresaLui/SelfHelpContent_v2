# Support for geospatial operators issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

You are trying to Migrate your data to CosmosDB MongoDB as it now supports Geospatial operators.
But the indexing does not allow "2d" mode. However, "2dsphere" is allowed.

####Resolution:
At this time we support "2dsphere" and plan to support "2d" in the future.  

Please review https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes as you'll need most likely be better served using "2dsphere"

Thank you .

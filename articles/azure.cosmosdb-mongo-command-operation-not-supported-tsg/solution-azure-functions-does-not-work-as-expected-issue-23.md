# Azure Functions does not work as expected issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

We have made a recent change to block cross API access. The change is only enabled for new mongo accounts. With this flag enabled, a mongo account could not be accessed with DocumentDB SDK (or change feed reader)for data operations. Management operations (offer replace/ Database creation/Collections creation) are still allowed. The change will impact Azure functions as it uses change feed reader behind the scene.

Thank you.

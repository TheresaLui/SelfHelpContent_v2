# Compound index not supported with nested paths issues

<!--issueDescription-->
### ** THIS IS NOT A CUSTOMER READY CONTENT MESSAGE **

**Next steps:** Please confirm that no arrays are in the path then transfer to PG to enable config. 

## Example of Customer Message:
Dear customer,

If you are getting the error below:
```
globaldb:PRIMARY> db.test.createIndex({a:1,"c.d":1})
{
        "ok" : 0,
        "errmsg" : "Compound index does not currently support nested documents or arrays.",
        "code" : 115,
        "codeName" : "CommandNotSupported"
}
```

#### Cause
Please be aware that we currently do not support nested documents or arrays.  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-indexing#index-types  

#### Mitigation
* Please confirm that no arrays are in the path.  
* Refactor data model to bring field to root.  

Thank you .

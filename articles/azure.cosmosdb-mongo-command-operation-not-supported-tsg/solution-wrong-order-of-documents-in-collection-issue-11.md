# Wrong order of documents in collection issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

You are getting the issue Wrong order of documents in collection is not being retuned as expected in a find() query. The order of insert is being defined by the _id or ObjectId() field that is auto generated.  or sometimes set in the document. 

###Solution:
Having an index does not guaranty sorted result. If the you wants sorted result, please use sort function.  db.collfind({}).sort({_id:1}) 

Thank you.

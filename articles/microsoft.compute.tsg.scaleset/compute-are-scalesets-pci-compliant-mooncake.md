# Are scale sets PCI-compliant

Virtual machine scale sets are a thin API layer on top of the CRP. Both components are part of the compute platform in the Azure service tree.

From a compliance perspective, virtual machine scale sets are a fundamental part of the Azure compute platform. They share a team, tools, processes, deployment methodology, security controls, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, monitoring, alerting, and so on, with the CRP itself. Virtual machine scale sets are Payment Card Industry (PCI)-compliant because the CRP is part of the current PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) attestation.

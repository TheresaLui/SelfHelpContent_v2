# Once Jarvis Logs have been checked

Once you know the Key Vault Limits, you can run [Azure Key Vault Service Logs - Overview](https://dev.azure.com/SupportabilityWork/Azure%20Security/_wiki/wikis/Information%20Protection/2508/Azure-Key-Vault-Service-Logs) to see if you can identify any 429 which is the code for Service's throttling.  A query like [this](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/687FF344) will help you. ( Just fit the time frame and Vault's name to your customer's scenario)

# Azure Key Vault Limits

<!--issueDescription-->

[Troubleshooting 429](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/rest-error-codes#http-429-too-many-requests)<br>Throttling is worked around using these techniques:<br><br>* Reduce number of requests made to the Key Vault by determining if there are patterns to a requested resource and attempting to cache them in the calling application.<br><br>* When Key Vault throttling occurs, adapt the requesting code to use a exponential backoff for retrying. The algorithm is explained here: How to throttle your app<br><br>* If the number of requests cannot be reduced by caching and timed backoff does not work, then consider splitting the keys up into multiple Key Vaults. The service limit for a single subscription is 5x the individual Key Vault limit. If using more than 5 Key Vaults, consideration should be given to using multiple subscriptions.<br><br>Detailed guidance including request to increase limits, can be find here: [Key Vault throttling guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview-throttling)<br><br>

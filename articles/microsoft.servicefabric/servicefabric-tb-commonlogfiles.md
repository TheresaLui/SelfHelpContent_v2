# Common log files for Service Fabric nodes

## **Recommended steps**
You can easily capture all of the most common log files from a Service Fabric node with a single command.  This will create a ZIP file that you can then save offline for post-mortem analysis.  To create the ZIP file, [RDP](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/service-fabric-cluster-nodetypes/#remote-connect-to-a-vm-scale-set-instance-or-a-cluster-node) to a node and run CollectGuestLogs.exe.  CollectGuestLogs.exe can be found in the Azure Guest Agent folder (C:\WindowsAzure\Packages\CollectGuestLogs.exe). Among the files collected, these are most commonly used to troubleshoot problems:
 + Event Logs
   + Service Fabric Event Logs
   + Application and System Event Logs
   + Azure Event Logs
 + Azure Guest Agent logs
 + Extension/Plugin Setup Logs and Status Blobs
 + Node configuration
 + Service Fabric Installation Logs
 + Windows Azure Diagnostics logs and cached data

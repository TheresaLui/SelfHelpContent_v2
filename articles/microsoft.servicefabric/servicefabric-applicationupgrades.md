## **Recommended steps**
For errors upgrading a service, please try the following recommendations:

1. Make sure Cluster is in healthy state by checking Service Fabric Explorer, and if there are any warnings/Error investigate and fix those first.
2. Make sure version numbers updated in the service manifest file.

## **Recommended documents**
1. The upgrade process and common issues are documented at [Service Fabric application upgrade](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/service-fabric-application-upgrade/)
2. A detailed upgrade troubleshooting workflow can be found at [Troubleshoot application upgrades](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/service-fabric-application-upgrade-troubleshooting/)

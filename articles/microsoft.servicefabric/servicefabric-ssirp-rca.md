# Attention! This Service Fabric cluster will be affected by the upcoming SSIRP change

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified the Service Fabric cluster **<!--$sfclustername-->sfclustername<!--/$sfclustername-->** under subscription **<!--$subscriptionid-->subscriptionid<!--/$subscriptionid-->** and resource group **<!--$resourcegroup-->resourcegroup<!--/$resourcegroup-->** as likely to be impacted by an upcoming security change, which could cause service interruptions to this cluster. 

To avoid service interruptions, we recommend upgrading your Service Fabric cluster to a supported version. See this [guide](https://gist.github.com/athinanthny/f2191b93a3caea87446a73feacc66c79#service-fabric-runtime-version-including-breakfix) for FAQs, more details on whatâ€™s changing, and how to upgrade. 

If you have other service fabric clusters under this or any other subscription, you can use the script mentioned in section C of [Service Fabric runtime version, including breakfix](https://gist.github.com/athinanthny/f2191b93a3caea87446a73feacc66c79#service-fabric-runtime-version-including-breakfix) to check if they are impacted or not.

# Attention! This Service Fabric cluster will be affected by the upcoming SSIRP change

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified the Service Fabric cluster **<!--$sfclustername-->sfclustername<!--/$sfclustername-->** under subscription **<!--$subscriptionid-->subscriptionid<!--/$subscriptionid-->** and resource group **<!--$resourcegroup-->resourcegroup<!--/$resourcegroup-->**  to be impacted by an upcoming security breaking change that could cause service interruptions to this cluster. To avoid any service interruptions, we recommend to plan and upgrade your Service Fabric cluster to a supported version. Please follow this [guide]<https://gist.github.com/athinanthny/f2191b93a3caea87446a73feacc66c79#service-fabric-runtime-version-including-breakfix>  for FAQs and more details on whatâ€™s changing and how to upgrade. If you have other service fabric clusters under this or any other subscription, you can use the script mentioned in section 'C' of [this]<https://gist.github.com/athinanthny/f2191b93a3caea87446a73feacc66c79#service-fabric-runtime-version-including-breakfix> document to check if they are impacted or not.<br>

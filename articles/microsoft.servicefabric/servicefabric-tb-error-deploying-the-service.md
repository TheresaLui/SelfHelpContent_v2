# Errors deploying a service 

##**Recommended steps**
1. The majority of deployment failures are caused by exceptions when a service is starting. This could be a missing dependency or exception in the constructor, or an exception in one of the Service Fabric startup methods (RunAsync, OnActivateAsync, CreateServiceReplicaListeners, CreateServiceInstanceListeners). See the â€˜Common Failures and Troubleshooting Steps for Application/Service' section for how to troubleshoot.
2. Verify that your instance/replica count does not exceed the size of your cluster.

# Detected one or more missing seed nodes

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected one or more missing **seed nodes** in your Service Fabric cluster.  
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Missing seed nodes with automated script](https://github.com/Azure/Service-Fabric-Troubleshooting-Guides/blob/master/Cluster/How%20to%20fix%20missing%20seednodes%20with%20Automated%20script.md)

### What are seed nodes?

Nodes with the "Is Seed Node = true" designation are the nodes in the Primary NodeType responsible for forming the clusters ring topology and sharing the lease with the other nodes. You can learn more about the Federation subsystem [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-architecture#federation-subsystem). Service Fabric requires a quorum of seed nodes to be available and healthy to ensure cluster reliability, where the number of seed nodes required is based on the [Reliability Level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#the-reliability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) of your cluster. We strongly recommend you take steps to repair/replace the missing seed node to prevent cluster instability or blocked upgrades.  

See [Reliability characteristics of the cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#the-reliability-characteristics-of-the-cluster) for more information about the number of seed nodes required for each reliability tier.

### Common Causes

This issue commonly happens in one of the following scenarios:

1. [Scaling down the primary nodetype](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down) (VMMS) to less than the minimum number required based on the cluster [Reliability level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#the-reliability-characteristics-of-the-cluster)
2. Configuring Auto-scale on clusters with [Bronze durability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity#the-durability-characteristics-of-the-cluster). Silver or Gold durability is required if you want to use Auto-scale with a Service Fabric cluster.
3. Improperly removing VMs from the primary nodetype without calling [Disable-ServiceFabricNode](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/servicefabric/disable-servicefabricnode?view=azureservicefabricps) with `-Intent **RemoveNode**` to disable the node youâ€™re going to remove and replace it with a new seed node. This command is what tells the Service Fabric Resource Provider to elect a new seed node. 

**Note:** There needs to be at least one 'non-seed node' in the VMMS available to be promoted to the new seed node.

# My deployment fails with allocation errors

Your Cloud Service deployment (Staging or Production) can get pinned to a single cluster. When deployments fail when the cluster reaches its capacity, try the following steps:<br>

## **Recommended steps**

1. Wait and retry the deployment operation.<br>

	Resources may be freed up on the cluster after waiting that allow the deployment or scaling request to succeed.<br>

2. Deploy your package to a new cloud service.<br>

	Deploying to a new cloud service often goes on a new cluster with enough capacity. If successful, update the DNS to point to the new cloud service.<br>

3. Delete both production and staging slots and redeploy to the existing cloud service.<br>

	The new deployment goes to a cluster that has enough capacity. However, redeploying incurs downtime until the new deployment is ready.<br>

4. Remove the affinity group and [migrate to a Regional Virtual Network](https://docs.azure.cn/virtual-network/virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet/)

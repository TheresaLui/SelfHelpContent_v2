# My web application is not responding or timing out

## **Recommended steps**

1. Check the Cloud Service availability on Azure portal.

	Ensure that all role instances are in a **Ready** state. If they are not, refer to the troubleshooting blade.

2. RDP into the role instance and check the IIS process (**w3wp.exe**) in Task Manager is running.

	If the **w3wp.exe** process does not show in Task Manager, go to [IIS Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj635847.aspx) and restart the application.

3. Check the http response code you get in the browser.

	**50x** errors are application-related issues, refer to the troubleshooting blade.

4. Check that the default ports **80** (for http) and **443** (for https) are accessible. Use **TELNET** or **TCPING** to ensure that the **w3wp.exe** process is listening on it.

If your web application is accessible locally but not externally, it could be a network-related issue.

# I can't connect to an application on my VM

## **Recommended Steps**

First ensure you are able to RDP or SSH to the VM, and then try the following steps:

1. Verify the application is listening on the expected ports and endpoints.<br>

    Use the 'netstat -a' command to show active listening ports on the VM and check the endpoint's ACL rules for public and private ports.<br>

2. Test the application access from different VMs:<br>

    Try to access the application from a different virtual machine in the same virtual network, and test from VMs in different subnets. If you cannot access, check the host firewall and network security group configurations.<br>

3. Test external application access:<br>

    Try to access the application from a computer outside the virtual network. If you cannot access it, check the external load balancer configuration, endpoint (TCP or UDP), network security group, and NAT configuration.<br>

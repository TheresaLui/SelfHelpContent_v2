# My VM is slow

## **Recommended steps**
Try the following steps to diagnose and mitigate VM performance issues:

1. **Did you know PerfInsights can help you analyze Windows guest VM issues?**  
[Download PerfInsights](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54915&fa43d42b-25b5-4a42-fe9b-1634f450f5ee=True) and run it on the VM. To ensure a speedy resolution, provide us the PerfInsights logs if you create a support case. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/how-to-use-perfInsights)

2. Review your application error logs, traces, and metrics to determine if there are any application bottlenecks causing performance issues. As a quick way to recover from one-time issues, restart your application and machine.

3. Review operating system level metrics such as CPU, memory usage, IO, and network to see if any resource has consistently high utilization.<br>

	On **Windows**, use the [Perfmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/perfmon) tool<br>
	On **Linux**, use commands such as Top, VmStat, Lsof, and Tcpdump<br>

4. Use [VM and Storage Diagnostics](http://aka.ms/azurevmperf) in the Azure portal to identify if any resource is being overutilized or throttled. You can then enable diagnostics and monitoring to troubleshoot issues with Azure VMs and Storage.<br>
5. Restart the VM to address any VM operating system issues by clicking 'Restart' at the top of the VM resource blade.<br>
6. Scale up the virtual machine to a different VM type or series for increased performance by clicking 'Size' in the Settings blade of the VM resource.<br>
7. Consider using [Premium Storage for Azure Virtual Machine Workloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage-preview-portal/).<br>

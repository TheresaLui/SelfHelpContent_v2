## Check config and layer 2 connectivity

### Recommended Action

This could be an issue with

1. Layer 1 connectivity with Physical Port or Wiring issues at the provider end.
1. Layer 2 connectivity indicated by Incomplete ARP.
1. Configuration issues with VLAN, STAG, CTAG, Peering IP, etc.

#### Note

Microsoft does not control these scenarios. In the above scenarios, the customer should be advised to refer to his local network team and provider to fix the respective issues.

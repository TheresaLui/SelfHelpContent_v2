## Maximum number of prefixes reached

* This error indicates that the prefixes advertised by the peer device to MSEE reached the maximum capacity.
* We usually see BGP peers as flapping due to this error because once Maximum allowed prefixes reached, then BGP peers get reset.

### Recommended Reading

[Maximum prefixes supported per peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings#peeringcompare)  
| Peering type | Maximum prefixes supported|
|--|--|
| Private Peering | 4000 by default <br> 10,000 with ExpressRoute Premium|
| Microsoft Peering | 200 routes |
| Public peering    | 200 routes |

### Solution

* Customers can limit the route advertisement over the respective peering to avoid BGP down events.  
* Customers can also upscale the circuit SKU (in the case of private peering) to increase the limits.

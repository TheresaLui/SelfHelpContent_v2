# Collect and Review logs 

<br>
##### **Collect Guest Agent  and Extension Logs**
<br>
 
If the issue still persists, collect **Guest Agent** and **Extensions** Logs then ask AVA/TA/PG if needed: 
<br>
<br>

*  Check if the customer has **granted permission** for collecting logs.  
Go to (**ASC > Case Overview > Permissions > Log Permission (Granted)**).
<br>

*  Method 1 (**collecting logs using ASC**):  
Go to (**ASC > Resource Explorer for VM > Diagnostics tab > Inspect IaaS Disk > click + Create Report**).  
In the **Create Report** window, select **Diagnostic** from the Mode drop-down option and enter the 	required details then click **Run**.
<br>

*  Method 2 (**collecting logs manually from customers VM**)  
If the Inspect IaaS Disk isn't working or you need a more 	comprehensive set of logs then collect the logs (***after getting the customer permission***) from the 	following locations:
<br>
<br>

       - For **Windows Azure VM**  
 C:\Packages\Plugins\(get plugins based on current issue)  
 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\  
 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\WaAppAgent.log  

      - For **Linux Azure VM**  
 /var/lib/waagent/*.xml  
 /var/log/waagent.log*  
 /var/log/azure/*

#### **Review Guest Agent Logs**
<br>

When a backup is triggered and the VM is running you will see that Guest Agent **enable VMsnapshot/VMsnapshotLinux extension**. 
We would need to confirm the Guest Agent logs looks OK and the enable of extension was triggered from guest agent.  
<br>

#####For **Windows Azure VM**  
<br>


#####How to find if the VMSnapshot extension is enabled in Guest Agent log (**Review WaAppAgent)(C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\WaAppAgent.log**)  
<br>
When backup is triggered: 

*  A compute operation wake up Guest Agent to reach a new goal state.  
Use the start time of the Job/TaskId you have on previous steps as reference:

    *[WARN]  Driving to new goal state ..  
[WARN]  Try installing/enabling extension(s).*

* From there all the extensions in the machine then get enabled and updated if needed.     
Make sure you filter the lines that have .**VMSnapshot**keywords other extension failing might not be of interest.

* See relevant lines in logs.
<br>
 **Note : You might see other steps before this  like the download of the manifest, install / unzip of extension if needed, but this is the enable part.**
<br>
    *[INFO] **Beginning enable of plugin Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot**   
......  
[WARN]  Started a process with the launch command  
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\<version>\IaaSBcdrExtension.exe, params:...*
......  
[INFO]  Successfully enabled plugin Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot*
<br>
<br>
<br>

#####For **Linux Azure VM**  
<br>
#####How to find if the VMSnapshot extension is enabled in Linux Guest Agent log (**/var/log/waagent.log**)
<br>
When backup is triggered: 

* A compute operation  wake up Guest Agent to reach a new goal state.  
Use the start time of the Job/TaskId you have on previous steps as reference

    *INFO ExtHandler ExtHandler Fetching new goal state [incarnation 392 (new incarnation)]*  

*  From there all the extensions in the machine then get enabled and updated if needed.     
Make sure you filter the lines that have .**VMSnapshotLinux/ **keywords other extension failing might not be of interest.

*   See relevant lines **Linux example of enable** :

      *INFO ExtHandler [Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-version] Target handler state: enabled [incarnation 392] 
      INFO ExtHandler [Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-version] [Enable] current handler state is: enabled
      INFO ExtHandler [Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-version] Update settings file: 273.settings
      INFO ExtHandler [Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-version] **Enable extension [main/handle.sh enable]**  
      INFO ExtHandler ExtHandler ProcessGoalState completed*

<br>
<br>
**In both cases when you see the enable, extension execution start too, so either we will have a failure or a success that comes from our extension.**

# Other Backup Failure 

<br>

#### __Please try to analyze the Backup job to try to isolate the issue__  

<br>

Using the task ID saved from Kusto query shared on previous steps, please run the below Kusto query

<br>

     
			TraceLogMessage | where TaskId == "TASKID"  
			| project PreciseTimeStamp,  Message, Level 
			| order by PreciseTimeStamp desc     
 
<br> 
 
#### __Use the Level color code to help you track what errors might be happening in the Backup Job. After taking a look into the logs__

<br>

 * Level 1 lines(black)  contains exception,  and  should be review to see if they are the cause of backup process to stop . Some exception can be expected and  handle and backup continue , make sure they are the cause of the errocode that is raised for failure.   
 * Level 2 lines are in red and warnings 
 * Level 3 Lines are in yellow and are normal messages.

<br>

#### __Review key steps of the backup__
 
 For Managed VMs this some of the key points you will see on those traces for an scheduled job,note there are several  others steps this are some of the main ones.   See below :  Trigger,  restorepoint creation, commit of recovery points, job completing messages 

<br>

<br>

#### __Trigger of the backup__ 

<br>

* First lines should contain the job info  

	*Scheduled backup queue message processed and Triggering Backup | Params: {ContainerName = iaasvmcontainerv2; rg;vmname}{ResourceId = vaultid}{DataSourceId = Dsid}{Expected Backup StartTime = 2/10/2021 3:00:00 AM}{Actual Backup StartTime = 2/10/2021 3:12:26 AM}{subscriptionLoad = 9}{policyTimeZoneUTCOffset = 36000000000}*  

	*TriggerBackup job triggered. | Params: ....*   

	Rg= resource group of the VM 
	VMname= name of the VM  
	Resourceid =  vault id  
	Datasourceid =  datasource id  


<br>

#### __the check  of existing  restore point collection , and creation if needed__ 

<br>

* *...CheckAndGetRestorePointCollection() | Params: ...*


<br>

#### __Creation the restore point/snapshot__ 

<br>

*  If VM is running CRP (compute provider ) will wakeup GA(guest agent )  and will enable VMsnapshot extension on the VM  that will call VSS  .  If VM is not running CRP will communciate with storage to take the snapshot whitout involving the VM

	 *TrackAzureVmCreateManagedRestorePointTask start  
		Entering TrackCreateManagedRestorePoint() | Params: ....*

<br>

#### __Restore point creation status__   

<br>

* If the snapshot operation has succeeded / fail you will it here . If there was a failure at that time it means snapshot operation did not  complete.  We would advice to review   the  CRP  (compute) operation and  Guest Agent and Extension logs  


	*TrackCreateManagedRestorePoint: Response | Params: {IsSuccessStatusCode = True}{ResponseContent = {
		"startTime": "2021-02-10T03:12:32.5376103+00:00",
		"endTime": "2021-02-10T03:14:35.2726029+00:00",
		"status": "Succeeded",
		"name": "xxxxx"
	}}{ReasonPhrase = OK}{StatusCode = OK}* 

	*Status body | Params: {status = Succeeded}*

	*Exiting TrackCreateManagedRestorePoint() | Params: ...*

	*Managed restore point status details | Params: {StatusCode = 0}{StatusMessage = {"jobMessage":"","messageStr":"2\/10\/2021 3:14:13 AM , snapshotCreator=backupHostService, hostStatusCodePreSnapshot=200, hostStatusCodeDoSnapshot=200, Plugin enable Succeeded (command: Snapshot) Snapshot command completed ","snapshotConsistency":2}}{IsSuccessful = True}*

	*Exiting GetManagedRestorePoint() |...*

	*GetFinalManagedRestorePointDetails  | Params: {crp DataSize = 3196135993344}{ConsistencyMode = ApplicationConsistent}
	CRP status code : 0*            


<br>

#### __Commit of the restore points and  copy__     

<br>

* From that  point the snapshot is completed  and after we mark the snapshot as recovery point (tier 1 recovery point) for customer to restore and we start of the copy from the storage to the vault. This is the part of the job that will take more time

    *Create Task called for TaskName | Params: {TaskName = CommitTier1RpTask}*

* 	This task is called many times 

	*Create Task called for TaskName | Params: {TaskName = CopyBackUpBlobsTask}*

* 	We commit the recovery point after the copy is completed. 

	*Create Task called for TaskName | Params: {TaskName = CommitTier2RpTask}*

<br>

#### __Job completed and reporting__

<br>

* See we add the telemetry regarding the job status 

	*AddBackupTelemetryStats | Params: {SubscriptionId =subid}{CompanyId = vaultid}{ResourceId = XXXXXXX}{OperationName = ManagedFullBackUp}{Result = True}{StartTime = 2/10/2021 3:12:26 AM}{ContainerName = iaasvmcontainerv2;rg;vmname}{ErrorCode = Success}*

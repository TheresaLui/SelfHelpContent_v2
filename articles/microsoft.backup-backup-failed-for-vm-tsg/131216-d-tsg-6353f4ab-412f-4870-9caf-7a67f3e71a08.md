# Other Extension Failure

#### __Collect  logs__

<br>

 - Check if the customer has **granted permission** for collecting logs.  
 <br>
Go to (**ASC > Case Overview > Permissions > Log Permission (Granted)**).

 - Method 1 (**collecting logs using ASC**):  
 <br>
Go to (**ASC > Resource Explorer for VM > Diagnostics tab > Inspect IaaS Disk > click + Create Report**).  
In the **Create Report** window, select **Diagnostic** from the Mode drop-down option and enter the 	required details then click **Run**.

 - Method 2 (**collecting logs manually from customers VM**)  
 <br>
If the Inspect IaaS Disk isn't working or you need a more 	comprehensive set of logs then collect the logs (***after getting the customer permission***) from the 	following locations:

    __For Windows Azure VM__  
			 C:\Packages\Plugins\(get plugins based on current issue)  
			 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\  
			 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\WaAppAgent.log  
			 On event viewer " save all events as ... " for System and Application logs

 <br>

#### __Review logs__

<br>

__Any issues during the installation can be tracked, by reviewing the extension logs:__ 

  C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\<lastversion>

 Open **IaaSBcdrExtension log**  in this case each log has only the attemp of 1 day backup. Use the start time of the Taskid/job  of previous step as reference

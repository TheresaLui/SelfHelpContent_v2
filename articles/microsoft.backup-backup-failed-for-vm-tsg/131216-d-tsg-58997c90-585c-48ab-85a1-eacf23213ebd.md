# Backup failure precheck 

<br>
<br>
We will need the TaskId collected on previous steps. If you need it again  please re-run the following query 

In **Kusto Explorer** with the **Subscription Id** and **VMName** you gathered in ASC run the following Kusto Query:

<br>

    BCMBackupStats
	| where SubscriptionId == ""***SubscriptionId***""
	| where VMName == ""***VMName***"" 
	| where TIMESTAMP >= ago(10d)  
	| project TIMESTAMP, VMName, ErrorCode, OSVersion, GuestAgentInfo, TaskId
	| order by TIMESTAMP desc

<br>

From the most recent Job where you see the Backup Error in the **ErrorCode** column, grab the **TaskID** and paste it in the following query to gather further insights regarding the Backup Job logs:

<br>

    TraceLogMessage 
    | where TaskId == ""***TASKID***""
    | project PreciseTimeStamp, Message, Level
    | order by PreciseTimeStamp desc
		

<br>

Use the Level color code to help you track what errors ( red-warnings  and black-exceptions) might be happening in the Backup Job. After taking a look into the logs, please select one of the **Backup Error Codes** below to continue with troubleshooting.

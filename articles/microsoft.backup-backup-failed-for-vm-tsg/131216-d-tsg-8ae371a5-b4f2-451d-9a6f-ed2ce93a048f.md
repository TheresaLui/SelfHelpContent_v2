#### Collect Guest Agent and Extensions

<br>
 
If the issue still persists, collect **Guest Agent** and **Extensions** Logs then ask AVA/TA/PG if needed:  

<br>

 - Check if the customer has __granted permission__ for collecting logs.  
Go to (**ASC > Case Overview > Permissions > Log Permission (Granted)**).

 - Method 1 (**collecting logs using ASC**):  
Go to (**ASC -> Resource Explorer for VM -> Diagnostics tab -> Inspect IaaS Disk -> click + Create Report**).  
In the **Create Report** window, select **Diagnostic** from the Mode drop-down option and enter the 	required details then click **Run**.

 - Method 2 (**collecting logs manually from customers VM**)  
If the Inspect IaaS Disk isn't working or you need a more 	comprehensive set of logs then collect the logs (***after getting the customer permission***) from the 	following locations:

  - For **Windows Azure VM**  
 C:\Packages\Plugins\(get plugins based on current issue)  
 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\  
 C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\WaAppAgent.log  

  - For **Linux Azure VM**  
 /var/lib/waagent/*.xml  
 /var/log/waagent.log*  
 /var/log/azure/*  
 
 <br>
 
#### Review Logs
 
 <br>
 
* Use the start time of the job/taskid you have on previous steps as reference. 

<br>
	
#### Windows 
 
 * Guest  Agent log :  
 
     C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\WaAppAgent.log   

 * Extension logs :   
 
      C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\
      Open IaaSBcdrExtension log in this case each log has only the attemp of 1 day backup

<br>
#### Linux 
 
 * Guest Agent log : 
  
	 var\log\azure\WaAppAgent.log
	
 * Extension logs : 
  
	 var\log\azure\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux
Open **extension.log **(note extension log will have all the backup operations on the last days together) 

<br>

#### Analyze the Backup from service side to try to isolate the issue

<br>

Using the task ID saved from Kusto query shared on previous steps, please run the below Kusto query

<br>

     
			TraceLogMessage | where TaskId == "TASKID"  
			| project PreciseTimeStamp,  Message, Level 
			| order by PreciseTimeStamp desc     


* Use the Level color code to help you track what errors might be happening in the Backup Job. After taking a look into the logs .

* Level 1 lines(black) contains exception, and should be reviewed to see if they are the cause of backup process to stop . Some exception can be expected and handle and backup continue , make sure they are the cause of the errorcode that is raised for failure.

# IaaS Azure VM backup failing with UserErrorRpCollectionLimitReached 

<br>

##### __Cause 1: We need to check if the Customer has a lock applied on the resource group level:__  

<br>

* This issue could happen if there's a lock on the recovery point resource group preventing automatic cleanup of recovery points.

    Use TASK ID saved (from previous step) , run below Kusto query to check if the customer has locked the resource group that is causing the failure

			TraceLogMessage | where TaskId == "TASKID" 
			| where Message contains "UserErrorResourceGroupLockPreventsManagedRpDelete"
			| project PreciseTimeStamp,  Message, Level 
			| order by PreciseTimeStamp desc     
			

* If there is a lock on resource group, then your results will look something similar to below sample output.
		
	*UserErrorResourceGroupLockpreventsManaged*
		

* Now find out the name of the locked Resource Group using below query.

			TraceLogMessage | where TaskId == "TASKID" 
			| where Message contains ("AzureBackupRG") and Message contains ("ScopeLocked")
			| project PreciseTimeStamp,  Message, Level 
			| order by PreciseTimeStamp desc 
		

* Sample output :

	*ParseMessageAndGetErrorCode: error message and code right before parsing | Params: {exceptionErrorMessage = {"error":{"code":"ScopeLocked","message":"The scope'/subscription/resourcegroup/**AzureBackupRG**/providers/Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/ *

	*AzureBackup_20180927_095957"/Cannot perform delete operation becasue following scope(s) are locked*
		
<br>

__To resolve this issue__:

 1. Remove the lock on the resource group of the VM
 
 2. Retry the operation to trigger clean-up.

<br>


##### __Cause 2: Check if we are reaching the limit of RP/Snapshot__

<br>


* This issue can also happen if multiple backups are triggered per day. Currently we recommend only one backup per day, as the instant restore points are retained for 1-5 days per the configured snapshot retention and only 18 instant RPs can be associated with a VM at any given time.

*  To create a new restore point, delete existing restore points.

<br>

__To resolve this issue delete the old RP collection available in the VM's resource group by following the below steps__:

 1. From Azure Portal > VM with failed backup > Click on VM Resource Group > check **Show hidden types** 

 2. Look for resource (RP Collection) with naming format **AzureBackup_VMName** , and delete it 

 3. Retry the backup operation 


      Referencing: [Clean up restore point collection from Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-troubleshoot-vm-backup-fails-snapshot-timeout#clean-up-restore-point-collection-from-azure-portal).

<br>

__Note: If the resource (RP Collection) has large number of Restore Points, then deleting the same from portal may timeout and fail. This is a known CRP issue, where all restore points are not deleted in the stipulated time and the operation times out; however the delete operation usually succeeds after 2 or 3 retries.__

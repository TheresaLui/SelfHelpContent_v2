# Review Extension logs 


<br>
#### **Review Enable output on the logs**
<br>

On previous step you might identified Guest Agent team trigger a enable our extension . 

<br>

* On Windows : Confirm if the enable was successful on the CommandExecution.log If enable has failure please there try to correct what is preventing the enable to success.  
(C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\[Version]\CommandExecution.log) 


* On linux : Confirm if you see any error on Waagent.log  after the "Enable extension [main/handle.sh enable]" and if on **extension.log** (/var/log/Plugins/Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux) there anything written at the time of enable.

<br>

Make sure if enable is failing you try to address the issue there. Python version on linux,  Permission, AV blocking, incorrect dll etc..
<br>


<br>
#### **Review backup process if enable was ok**
<br>
 If enable was ok confirm if  something prevented the extension to complete the operation during backup steps  and report back to the Guest Agent.  

See below key  moments of backups to help you to  isolate any issue during the process , this example  expected step  should help you to identify in which  part  the extension might be stuck not reporting back to the agent (like waiting for VSS) 

Note if you see snapshot completing ok, you might need to revisit  the Guest Agent logs after at the time snapshot completed.  

<br>

##### **For Windows Azure VM**

<br>

**(C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\[Version]\IaaSBcdrExtension.log)**

Open **IaaSBcdrExtension.log**  in this case   each log  has only the attempt of 1 day backup. Use the start time of the Job/TaskId of previous step as reference:

The beginning of the file is the begining of the backup .

See relevant  example lines of backup process

 - Load configuration of the extension

        *[Information]:	Loading configuration {ConfigFile = C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot*

 - Check VCRedist installation state and if it is needed 

         *[Information]:	VCRedist installation state { isVCRedist2013Installed = True.... }*

- services check 

         *[Information]:	Service is not stopped...
[Information]:	Service is running now...*

- Check  and Install if needed IaaSVmProvider 

        *[Information]:	IsCommonProviderDllInstalled {isCommonProviderInstalledRegKey =*

* See above steps failing will be handle an raised  Extension installation failures not for this error code , we are looking if something make the extension "stuck"/"waiting"  and not able to report back to agent.

         *[Information]:	Provider installed successfully*

 - Register the IaaSVmProvider with VM

         *[Information]:	Registered the provider with VSS*

from this point VSS id involved in the operation and the offload work to that windows process , if VSS does not respond to some our commands extension might be there waiting too long, you would see a "waiting for" for hours in a specific operation

- We ask VSS to gather information about the writers in the VM

        [Information]:	Waiting for GatherWriterMetadata* 

- Check with the OS the drives that need to be snapshot 

*Adding drive to snapshotset....*

 - VSS do the backup  and snapshot complete.  


  *[Information]:	Waiting for GatherWriterStatusPreBackup    
[Information]:	Waiting for PrepareForBackup  
[Information]:	Waiting for DoSnapshotSet  
[Information]:	DoSnapshotSet {TimeTaken = 0}  
[Information]:	Waiting for BackupComplete   
[Information]:	DoSnapshot {TimeTaken = 0}*  

 
Check the status of snapshot on following line:  
*DoSnapshotHost=complete. startTime:2021-01-06T21:41:03.2451404Z, completionTime:2021-01-06T21:41:04.4326503Z, TotalTimeTaken:00:00:01.1875099  
DoSnapshot=complete. WaitResult:True, AnySnapshotFailed:False, AllSnapshotFailed:False, ReturnValue:True, DoSnapshotRunDuration:00:00:01.2031081*     

##### **For Linux Azure VM**

For linux : var\log\azure\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux  

Open **extension.log **(note extension log will have all the backup operations on the last days together)  .Use the start time of the Job/TaskId  of previous step as reference

See some key lines/steps  of  example backup process, note there may more  steps but this lines are mean to explain  a  normal backup .  They  can give you an idea in which part you are ,  although they might slightly different  on some scenarios:  

- Start of the backup 

*[Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0]starting enable*

 - We get   mountpoint info , note we run internal linux commands ,  that might fail / hang  (like mount  or lsblk) 

*[Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0]getting the mount-points info using mount command*

- We will take a look to  config file 

*[Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0] configfile /etc/azure/vmbackup.conf*

- We check if pre-script and post script exists

*[Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0]Plugin config path is /etc/azure/VMSnapshotScriptPluginConfig.json*


 - Read the custom setting
 
*Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0]customSettings : {"takeSnapshotFrom":"firstHostThenGuest","isManagedVm":true,"backupTaskId":"becb1e7a-d319-46c0-a428-c523dcb2fac4","backupRetryCount":0,"canTakeCrashConsistentSnapshot":false,"isOnlyOSDiskBackupEnabled":false,"waDiskLunList":[]}*

- Call snapshot 

*[Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0]Calling do snapshot method* 


 - We need to Freeze and Thaw see all the steps in the process filtering by "******"

NOTE: step 2 and 3 , 8  might be written on the file not in order 

*"   
****** 1. Starting Freeze Binary  
****** 2. Binary Freeze Started  
****** 3. Binary Freeze Completed  
****** 4. Freeze Completed (Signal=1 received)   
****** 5. Snaphotting (Host) Started   
****** 6. Snaphotting (Host) Completed   
****** 7. Sending Thaw Signal to Binary   
****** 8. Binary Thaw Signal Received  
****** 9. Binary Process completed (Signal=2 received)  
"*  

  - Report  snapshot on following line. See here all snapshot succeeded and the time it took  


*T:S takeSnapshotFromHost, time_before_snapshot=2020-08-28 20:39:02.827798, time_after_snapshot=2020-08-28 20:39:06.685694, snapshotTimeTaken=0:00:03.857896
2020/08/28 20:39:06    
T:S snapshotall ends...  
doFreezeSnapshot : run_result - 1 run_status - success all_failed - False unable_to_sleep - False is_inconsistent - False values post snapshot*  

See above might help you identify in which step the extension might be stuck not reporting back to the agent (running a Linux command, waiting for snapshot to complete ... etc)

# Pricing in Azure Cosmos DB
Most users are able to resolve their Billing and Pricing case using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

Azure Cosmos DB resources are charged based on the storage consumed(GB) and the throughput provisioned(RU/s) for a container. Each container with provisioned throughput is billed on an hourly basis for the throughput provisioned in increments of 100 RU/second.

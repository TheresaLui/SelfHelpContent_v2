# How to develop applications with Azure Cosmos DB Table API

An existing application using the Azure Table Storage service can seamlessly connect to Azure Cosmos DB's Table API without any modification, and instantly benefit from the following premium capabilities:

* Elastic performance: the expected performance can be adjusted manually from the Azure Portal, or programmatically through API/SDK calls
* Automatic secondary indexing: all columns get automatically indexed by default
* Global distribution: tables can be replicated to any Azure datacenter to ensure low latency and high availability
* Comprehensive SLAs covering availability, latency, consistency and throughput

The Table API has client SDKs available for .NET, Java, Python, and Node.js.

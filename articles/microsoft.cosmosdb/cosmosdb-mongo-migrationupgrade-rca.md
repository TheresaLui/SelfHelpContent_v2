# Upgrade to Mongo server version 3.6

## Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB v3.6

Migrate <!--$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->[GlobalDatabaseAccountName]<!--/$GlobalDatabaseAccountName--> to a new database account to take advantage of the latest version of the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB v3.6.

<!--issueDescription-->

Version 3.6 of the service provides the most up-to-date functionality, recent fixes, and enhancements in performance and stability.

<!--/issueDescription-->

When upgrading the service, you must also migrate the data in your existing account to a new account created using version 3.6 of the MongoDB API engine. Azure Data Factory or Studio 3T can assist you in migrating your data.

### Benefits of upgrading to version 3.6

- Enhanced performance and stability
- Support for new database commands
- Support for aggregation pipeline by default and new aggregation stages
- Support for Change Streams
- Support for compound Indexes
- Cross-partition support for the following operations: update, delete, count and sort
- Improved performance for the following aggregate operations: $count, $skip, $limit and $group
- Wildcard indexing is now supported

### Changes from previous engine versions

- **RequestRateIsLarge errors have been removed**. 
  Requests from the client application will no longer return "16500" errors. Instead, requests will resume until they complete or fulfill the timeout.
- Per request timeout is set to 60 seconds.
- MongoDB collections created on the new wire protocol version will only have the `_id` property indexed by default.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue
<!--issueDescription-->
We found high RU consumption for indexing terms within your documents.
<!--/issueDescription-->
Inserting or updating documents with large number of properties may result in high indexing RUs being consumed as part of document insert or update.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Evaluate encoding non-queryable content
If there are properties/sections in your items that are not queried, but need to be globally distributed or accessed at low latency, e.g. binary content or free text, consider an encoding/compression to reduce their footprint and RU consumption.

### Evaluate custom indexing policy
If your items are dense in content (contain a large number of properties), the RUs consumed for indexing may be high. Every property consumes about 0.15 RUs, and this can add up if you have 100s-1000s of RUs. 

## **Recommended Documents**

See [Indexing policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/indexing-policies) for more details.

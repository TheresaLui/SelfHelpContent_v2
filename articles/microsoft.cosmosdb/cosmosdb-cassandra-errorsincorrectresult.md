# Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API - Common errors

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Rate limiting errors**
Some of the queries including aggregations require a large amount of processing. If the collection's throughput is not enough, you will see these errors. You can confirm this by going to the **Metrics** blade and selecting the **Throughput** tab for your collection. 

### **SSL Connection failure**
Azure Cosmos DB enforces strict security requirements and does require SSL for connection.  

### **CQL Reserved Keywords**  
A reserved keyword such as *Password* cannot be used as an identifier unless you enclose the word in double quotation marks. Non-reserved keywords have a specific meaning in certain context but can be used as an identifier outside this context.
<br>Please see the CQL for Apache Cassandra reference [CQL Keywords](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/keywords_r.html) for a reserved keyword table and additional information.

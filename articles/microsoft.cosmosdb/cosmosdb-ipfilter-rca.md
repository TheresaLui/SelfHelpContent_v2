# IP Blocked by Firewall

## We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
The following IP addresses: **<!--$IPAddresses-->[IPAddresses]<!--/$IPAddresses-->** are not whitelisted for sending requests to the account: **<!--$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->[GlobalDatabaseAccountName]<!--/$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->**.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

It appears that your account has an IP access control policy which is restricting access to an IP range.

To configure IP policy-based access control, you must provide the set of IP addresses or IP address ranges in CIDR form to be included as the allowed list of client IPs for a given database account. Once this configuration is applied, all requests originating from machines outside this allowed list are blocked by the server.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Update the IP Access Control Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/firewall-support)

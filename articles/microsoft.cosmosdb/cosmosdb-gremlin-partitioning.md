# Gremlin - Partitioning

Azure Cosmos DB models vertices and edges as documents and stores them in the same collection. Azure Cosmos DB collections are partitioned. Gremlin stores **vertices** and **outgoing edges** with the same partition key. Edges inherit partitioning key from the source vertex.

Example of setting partition key on the vertex, if **/pk** is partitioning key on collection
```
g.addV('vertexlabel').property('pk', 'pkValue')
```

Example of limiting search of vertices to a single partition key. Following strategy will instruct Gremlin engine to perform traversal only within a given partition even though there may be vertices matching the criteria in other partitions.
```
g.withStrategies(PartitionStrategy.build().partitionKey('pk').readPartitions('pkValue').create()).V('V1')
```

```.outE()``` is more efficient than ```.inE()``` step because outgoing edges are stored with the source vertex. To find incoming edges, Gremlin engine needs to perform a fan-out query across all partitions. If traversal require great performance on incoming edge retrieval step then it is recommended to create two edges *source-to-target* and *target-to-source* and replace ```.inE()``` with ```.outE()```.

Every traversal hop between vertices connected by an edge requires Gremlin engine to reach into storage layer, even if both vertices are stored in the same partition. 

A great partitioning key exhibits the following properties:
1. Data and load is equally distributed across all partitions. 
2. There are no hot partitions storage or throughput-wise.
3. Traversal are scoped to a subset of partition and rarely fan-out to all of them.

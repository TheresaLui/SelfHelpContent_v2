# Azure Cosmos DB about long running scale operations

**How long will my scale operation take?**  

Azure Cosmos DB currently only supports scale up operation. It is typically a long running operation. You can use below table to estimate how long it will take.  

**Note**: Minimum Throughput - **Scale Factor** - *Estimated Duration*

* 400 - **<25** - *<1 minute*
* 400 - **25 < Scale factor < 50** - *6 hours*
* 400 - **50 < Scale factor < 100** - *12 hours*
* 400 - **100 < Scale factor < 200** - *18 hours*
* Less than 400 - **<100** - *<1 minute*
* Less than 400 - **100 < Scale factor < 200** - *6 hours*

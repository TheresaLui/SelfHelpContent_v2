# Cosmos DB returns service unavailable

The Cosmos DB client might return "Service Unavailable" due to client machine issues, service issues, or environment (network) issues. If you don't see a service health issue in the Azure portal, a common reason for seeing this error is high CPU, low memory, or network failure at the client level.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Use latest SDK versions and singleton client**
* Always ensure that you are using the latest SDK, [Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK for SQL API: Download and release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-dotnet-standard)
* Ensure you are using singleton client  

### **Firewall**
If you see failures related to request being blocked by firewall, with errors like:

```
Request originated from client IP {...} through public internet. This is blocked by your Cosmos DB account firewall settings.
```

Make sure your [firewall configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-firewall) includes the desired IP. If you recently modified this configuration, keep in mind that **changes can take up to 15 minutes** to propagate.

### **TransportException**
The ServiceUnavailable exception can contain a TransportException when the exception details are serialized. The TransportException normally indicates a client-side connectivity issue. For example:

```
TransportException: A client transport error occurred: The request timed out while waiting for a server response. 
(Time: xxx, activity ID: xxx, error code: ReceiveTimeout [0x0010], base error: HRESULT 0x80131500
```

The TransportException can also contain a CPU history measurement, which takes a CPU utilization measurement every 10 seconds. For example:

```
CPU history: 
(2020-08-28T00:40:09.1769900Z 0.114), 
(2020-08-28T00:40:19.1763818Z 1.732), 
(2020-08-28T00:40:29.1759235Z 0.000), 
(2020-08-28T00:40:39.1763208Z 0.063), 
(2020-08-28T00:40:49.1767057Z 0.648), 
(2020-08-28T00:40:59.1689401Z 0.137), 
CPU count: 8)
```

If the CPU measurements are over 70%, then the ServiceUnavailable is likely to be caused by **CPU exhaustion**. In this case, the solution is to investigate the source of the high CPU utilization and reduce it, or scale the machine to a larger resource size.

If the CPU measurements are not happening every 10 seconds (e.g., gaps or measurement times indicate larger times in between measurements), the cause is **thread starvation**. In this case the solution is to investigate the source/s of the thread starvation (potentially locked threads), or scale the machine/s to a larger resource size.

If CPU measurements are normal, and the TransportException returns a request timeout, verify if the instance is running into **port exhaustion**. Depending on the service your application runs on, the metrics might differ. For instructions and next steps for the various Azure services, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-dot-net-sdk-request-timeout#socket-or-port-availability-might-be-low).

### **Correlations**  

To collect multiple *ServiceUnavailableException* messages and determine if all failures involve a single machine or a single data replica, find the *StorePhysicalAddress* fields in the error messages.  
* **Example:** ResponseTime: 2018-10-16T20:31:38.8084670Z, StoreReadResult: *StorePhysicalAddress: rntbd://dz5prdapp03-docdb-1.documents.azure.com:14135/*, LSN: -1, GlobalCommittedLsn: -1, PartitionKeyRangeId: , IsValid: True, StatusCode: 410, IsGone: True, IsNotFound: False, IsInvalidPartition: False, RequestCharge: 0, ItemLSN: -1, SessionToken: , ResourceType: Document, OperationType: Read

If the message lacks a *StorePhysicalAddress* field, find the *Request URI* field.
* **Example:** Microsoft.Azure.Documents.GoneException: Message: The requested resource is no longer available at the server. ActivityId: c3a37839-b476-4817-8a7a-a03ff0bca67d, *Request URI: /apps/905b0dc7-5521-445f-b54f-8e6e8fcddfba/services/bd39f580-9893-4671-bfa4-2ae279c8574a/partitions/84cf9e9f-9bfc-40d7-92eb-6268941dd0a3/replicas/131866380111007790s/*, RequestStats: , SDK: Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Common/2.1.0.0, Local IP: 100.115.170.28

If *TransportException* is present (.NET Cosmos DB SDK 2.3 and newer), find the *URI* and *connection* fields.
* **Example:** Microsoft.Azure.Documents.TransportException: A client transport error occurred: The request timed out while waiting for a server response. (Time: 2019-01-09T09:47:10.7429304Z, activity ID: 960960f8-3191-4cc4-bd79-eff8028aaf59, error code: ReceiveTimeout [0x0010], base error: HRESULT 0x80131500, *URI: rntbd://byaprdapp05-docdb-2.documents.azure.com:14036/apps/2c77ff9f-6270-4ef5-9744-6cc65ce3cbc6/services/1222fe0d-54d5-43c0-8bcd-3343e7f7afde/partitions/191710da-2618-459f-8bc1-e806840c41fe/replicas/131894644130405731p/*, *connection: 10.90.123.166:64200 -> 40.118.245.251:14036*, payload sent: True, CPU history: not available, CPU count: 24)

If multiple server host:port pairs or multiple (partition, replica) pairs are present across different error messages, this indicates a problem with the client machine with a high degree of confidence.  

If multiple client machines fail to connect to a single server, this may indicate a network or service issue. When filing a support ticket, include *StorePhysicalAddress*, *Request URI*, server host:port, and the UTC time range of the issue in your request.

### **Performance and Availability Tips**  
Ensure that your application follows the guidance outlined in this article:  
* [Performance Tips with respect to networking and SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/performance-tips-dotnet-sdk-v3-sql)

Additional latency and performance tips include:  
* Use [Direct/TCP as connectivity mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-sdk-connection-modes)
* Include client into Cosmos account VNET 
* For Azure functions, use a non-consumption plan 
* Ensure that the Cosmos container is not getting throttled. By default, the SDK does retry throttles for availability, which you can override through the APIs below.
* Monitor physical resource utilization (CPU, memory, network throughput etc). Alert on excessive resource utilization.
* Use request deadlines appropriate for the service type: Shorter for latency-sensitive jobs (5-10 seconds) and longer for batch jobs (30-60 seconds)

### **Retry on failed operations**  
Retry failed operations:  
* [.NET Retry Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.maxretryattemptsonratelimitedrequests)
* [Java Retry Options](https://azure.github.io/azure-cosmosdb-java/1.0.0/index.html?com/microsoft/azure/cosmosdb/RetryOptions.html)
* Implement a retry loop with exponential back-off and random jitter for writes. Cosmos DB cannot automatically retry writes.

# Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB - Accessing Data
Most users are able to resolve their Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB Accessing Data issue using the steps below.  


## **Recommended Steps**  

###**Unable to set item level TTL for Analytical Store**

At this time, TTL for analytical data can only be configured at container level and there is no support to set analytical TTL at item level. 

<br>

###**Updating the Analytical Store Time-To-Live**
After the analytical store is enabled with a particular TTL value, you can update it to a different valid value later. You can update the value by using the Azure portal or SDKs. For information on the various Analytical TTL config options, see the analytical TTL supported values article. Learn how to configure Analytical TTL. 

<br>

###**Missing items in Analytical Store** 
If specific items in your container violate the well-defined schema for analytics, they will not be included in the analytical store. If you have scenarios blocked by well-defined schema for analytics, email the Azure Cosmos DB team for help.

# Performance tips for Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API

## **Recommended Steps**

In order to achieve the best performance for Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API, there are a few aspects you can configure:
* Collocate clients in same Azure region for performance
* Increase parallelism on the client whenever possible
* Use singleton Azure Cosmos DB client for the lifetime of your application
* Exclude unused paths from indexing for faster writes
* Design for smaller documents for higher throughput


### **Deleting large amounts of data**
If you are wanting to delete large amounts of data without impacting RU:
* Consider using TTL (Based on Timestamp) [Expire data with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-time-to-live)
* Use Cursor/Batch size to perform the delete. You can fetch a single document at a time and delete it through a loop. This would help you to slowly delete without impacting your production application.

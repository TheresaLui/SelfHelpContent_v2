# Lazy Indexing detected

## We ran diagnostics on your account **<!--$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->[GlobalDatabaseAccountName]<!--/$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->** and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
We found one or more containers using lazy indexing. 
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

We highly recommend upgrading to **consistent indexing** for performance and reliability improvements, especially if you expect to frequently run queries against your data. Lazy indexing performs updates to the index at a much lower priority level, when the engine is not doing any other work. This can result in **inconsistent or incomplete** query results. 

If you plan to query a Cosmos container, you should not select lazy indexing.

For optimal query performance, we recommend selecting consistent indexing. The RU charge for the same query will be significantly lower in a container with consistent indexing than a container with lazy indexing. In addition, many indexing features, such as composite indexes require consistent indexing.

**Note:** Because the benefits of consistent indexing are significant, we have removed the option for lazy indexing in new containers. We want to encourage customers to follow this indexing best practice.

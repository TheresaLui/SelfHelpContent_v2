# Azure Cosmos DB - General Advisory
Most users are able to resolve their General Advisory Questions using the steps below.


## **Recommended Steps**

### **Unable to register for Preview Features**
Issue: I want to preview some new features but I am not able to complete the registration in the portal.
- The account may be missing the required permission
- The subscription also would require Resource Provider "Microsoft.Features" to be registered
For additional information please see [Microsoft.Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftfeatures).

### **Data backup retention**
Azure Cosmos DB automatically takes a backup of your database every 4 hours and at any point of time, only the latest 2 backups are stored. However, if the container or database is deleted, Azure Cosmos DB retains the existing snapshots of a given container or database for 30 days.
<br>We do have the option to increase the backups retention duration to help you customize.  
There are some limits for the backups:
* Backups cannot be retained for more than 30 days
* The number of backups cannot be more than 25 at the same time
* The minimum backup interval is 1 hour

# Free Tier in Azure Cosmos DB

Most users are able to resolve their Cosmos DB related Free Tier questions or issue using the steps below.


## **Recommended Steps**  

### **Not able to create a Free Tier account (COVID-19)**
As companies operationalize to address new and unique challenges, we have mobilized our global response plan to help customers stay up and running during this critical time. We are actively monitoring performance and usage trends 24/7 to ensure we are optimizing our services for customers worldwide, while accommodating new demand. We are working closely with first responder organizations and critical government agencies to ensure we are prioritizing their unique needs and providing them our fullest support. We are also partnering with governments around the globe to ensure our local datacenters have on-site staffing and all functions are running properly.

As demand continues to grow, if we are faced with any capacity constraints in any region during this time, we have established clear criteria for the priority of new cloud capacity. Top priority will be going to first responders, health and emergency management services, critical government infrastructure organizational use, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running with the core functionality of Teams. We will also consider adjusting free offers, as necessary, to ensure support of existing customers.

However, you should be able to perform all operations against your existing Free Tier Azure Cosmos DB account.

### **Free tier account limits**
- Number of free tier accounts per Azure subscription: *1*
- Duration of free-tier discount: *Lifetime of the account. Must opt-in during account creation.*
- Maximum RUs for free: *400 RUs*
- Maximum storage for free: *5 GB*
- Maximum number of shared throughput databases: *5*
- Maximum number of containers in a shared throughput database: *25 In free tier accounts, the minimum RUs for a shared throughput database with up to 25 containers is 400 RUs*


### **How does the Free Tier discount show up on my bill?**
In Free Tier accounts, you will get the first 400 RUs and 5 GB of storage in your account for free. Any RUs and storage beyond 400 RUs and 5 GB will be billed at the regular pricing rates per the pricing page. On the bill, you will not see a charge or line item for the free 400 RUs and 5 GB, only the RUs and storage beyond what is covered by free tier.  

### **Does Free Tier apply to all the Azure Cosmos DB APIs?**
Yes, Free Tier works for all Azure Cosmos DB APIs including Core (SQL), API for MongoDB, Cassandra, and Gremlin.   

### **Can I apply the Free Tier discount to autopilot databases and containers?**
**Answer:** Yes. With autopilot, you are billed for the highest RUs the database or container scales to in the hour. When the free tier discount is applied, 400 RUs will be subtracted from that value. See our documentation for examples and details.  

### **How does Free Tier discount work if I have an account with multiple regions?**
In multi-region accounts, the RUs of the database or container are replicated in all regions. For example, if you have a container with 400 RUs and the account is in 3 regions, the total RUs of the account is 1200 RUs. When the discount is applied, you will be billed for 1200 RUs â€“ 400 RUs = 800 RUs per hour.  

### **Enable Free Tier when creating a new account in the Azure Portal is not appearing. Where is the option?**
**Solution: ** You can have up to one Free Tier account in an Azure subscription. If the option does not appear, this means another account in the subscription is already enabled with Free Tier.

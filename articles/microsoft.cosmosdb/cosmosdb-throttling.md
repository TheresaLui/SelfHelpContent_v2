# Rate limiting in Azure Cosmos DB

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Increase RU/s**

You may have not provisioned enough RUs to meet your per-second request rates. The throughput (RUs) can be increased via the Azure portal, ARM template, PowerShell, Azure CLI or the Cosmos DB SDK.

* [Update throughput (RU/s) using ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/resource-manager-samples)
* [Update throughput (RU/s) using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/scripts/powershell/sql/ps-sql-ru-update?toc=%2fpowershell%2fmodule%2ftoc.json)
* [Update throughput (RU/s) using Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/scripts/scale-collection-throughput-cli?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json)
* [Update throughput (RU/s using .NET SDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput#update-throughput-on-a-database-or-a-container)

### **Increase retries**

If your application is not latency sensitive, you can keep the RUs fixed and increase the number of retries for the Cosmos DB client. For the core (SQL) API, this is available as a configuration in the native SDK when you instantiate the Cosmos DB client.

```csharp

// update retries (default is 10)
RetryOptions retryOptions = new RetryOptions
{
    MaxRetryAttemptsOnThrottledRequests = 15
};

ConnectionPolicy connectionPolicy = new ConnectionPolicy
{
    ConnectionMode = ConnectionMode.Direct,
    ConnectionProtocol = Protocol.Tcp,
    RetryOptions = retryOptions
};

DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(new Uri(endpoint), key, connectionPolicy);

client.OpenAsync();

```

### **Partition Key Choice**

If your throughput utilization is low overall, but you still see rate limiting, you may have to review your partition key choice for skew. You can monitor your Azure Cosmos DB containers in the Azure portal to see if your requests are skewed to one or few partitions. If this is the cause of the rate limiting, you can migrate to a new container with near zero downtime using Change Feed.

* [Change Feed in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed)

### **Rate limiting in write-heavy scenarios**

If your RU consumption is predominantly from writes, you may be able to reduce RU consumption by modeling as smaller documents, tuning indexing policy, or by writing in batches.

* [Exclude unused paths from indexing for faster writes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/performance-tips#indexing-policy)
* [Bulk Executor Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/bulk-executor-overview)

### **Rate limiting in read-heavy scenarios**

If your RU consumption is predominantly from reads, you may be able to reduce RU consumption by tuning individual queries, lowering consistency level, or by reading in batches.

* [Understand Request units in Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/request-units)
* [Get query execution metrics and analyze performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/profile-sql-api-query)
* [Tune query performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-query-metrics)
* [Optimize reads and writes cost](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/optimize-cost-reads-writes)

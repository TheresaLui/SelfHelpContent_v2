# MongoDB - How-to

Most users are able to resolve their Cosmos DB related MongoDB How-to questions or issues using the steps below.  

### **Migrating MongoDB Data to Cosmos DB**  

To migrate data from MongoDB to an Azure Cosmos DB account for use with the API for MongoDB, you must:

* Download either `mongoimport.exe` or `mongorestore.exe` from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).
* Get your [API for MongoDB connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/connect-mongodb-account).

**Note:** Throughput that you provision directly impacts the duration of migration. Consider increasing RUs during migration and scaling down after they complete.

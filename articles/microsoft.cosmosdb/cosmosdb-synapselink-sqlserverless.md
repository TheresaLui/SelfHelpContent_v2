# Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB - SQL Serverless
Most users are able to resolve their Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB issues using the steps below.  


## **Recommended Steps**  

### **Supported APIs**  

Today Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB is supported for SQL API and Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB. It is not supported for Gremlin API and Table API. Support for Cassandra API is in private preview, for more information please contact the Azure Synapse Link team at cosmosdbsynapselink@microsoft.com.  

### **My query isn't showing the data I just inserted into Azure Cosmos DB Container**  

Azure Cosmos DB will sync your transactional data with analytical store within 2 and 5 minutes. Please wait up to 5 minutes and re-run your query.


### **My query isn't working with the Linked Service for Azure Cosmos DB that I created**  

+ Support for Linked Services is planned for the first semester of 2021. For now you need to use OPENROWSET function.

+ When available, it will work for Linked Services for Azure Cosmos DB containers with analytical store enabled.


### **Unable to load data into Cosmos DB using SQL Serverless**  

Synapse SQL Serverless is read only.  


### **Error when trying to create a view**  

You need to use an user database to create a view. You can't use the **master** or the **default** databases.

+ If you try to create a view in Synapse's default database, you will get the "Operation CREATE/ALTER VIEW is not allowed for a replicated database" error.

+ If you try to create a view in Synapse's master database, you will get the "CREATE/ALTER VIEW is not supported in master database" error.

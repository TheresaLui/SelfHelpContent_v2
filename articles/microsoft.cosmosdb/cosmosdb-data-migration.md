# Migrating data to Azure Cosmos DB
Most users are able to resolve their data migration case using the steps and recommended documents below.


## **Recommended Steps**

You can migrate data to Azure Cosmos DB by using a wide variety of tools. To understand which is the best tool, the following factors need to be understood:


### **Factors affecting the choice of migration tool**

The following factors determine the choice of the migration tool:

* **Online vs offline migration**: Many migration tools provide a path to do a one-time migration only. This means that the applications accessing the database might experience a period of downtime. Some migration solutions provide a way to do a live migration where there is a replication pipeline set up between the source and the target.
* **Data source**: The existing data can be in various data sources like Oracle DB2, DataStax Cassandra, Azure SQL Database, PostgreSQL, etc. The data can also be in an existing Azure Cosmos DB account and the intent of migration can be to change the data model or repartition the data in a container with a different partition key.
* **Azure Cosmos DB API**: For the SQL API in Azure Cosmos DB, there are a variety of tools developed by the Azure Cosmos DB team which aid in the different migration scenarios. All of the other APIs have their own specialized set of tools developed and maintained by the community. Since Azure Cosmos DB supports these APIs at a wire protocol level, these tools should work as-is while migrating data into Azure Cosmos DB too. However, they might require custom handling for throttles as this concept is specific to Azure Cosmos DB.
* **Size of data**: Most migration tools work very well for smaller datasets. When the data set exceeds a few hundred gigabytes, the choices of migration tools are limited. 
* **Expected migration duration**: Migrations can be configured to take place at a slow, incremental pace that consumes less throughput or can consume the entire throughput provisioned on the target Azure Cosmos DB container and complete the migration in less time.

### **Examples of migration tool options**

To view the **complete list of options**, please see the [official article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cosmosdb-migrationchoices).

Some of the most common options are:

* For SQL API: For offline migrations, [Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db) or [the Azure Cosmos DB Spark connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/spark-connector) are good options. For online migrations, [Striim](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cosmosdb-sql-api-migrate-data-striim) or the [custom migration service](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmosdb-live-data-migrator) are good options.
* For Mongo API: For offline migrations, [Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db) or [existing Mongo tools (mongodump, mongorestore)](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/using-mongodb-tools-with-azure-cosmos-db/) are good options. For online migrations, the [Azure Data Migration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-mongodb-cosmos-db-online) can be leveraged.
* For Cassandra API: For offline migrations, the [cqlsh COPY command](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-import-data#migrate-data-using-cqlsh-copy-command) or [copy table with Spark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-import-data#migrate-data-using-spark) are good options. For online migrations, [Striim](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cosmosdb-cassandra-api-migrate-data-striim) or [Blitzz](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/oracle-migrate-cosmos-db-blitzz) are good options.
* For other APIs: The [Data Migration Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table-import#data-migration-tool) can help migrate data.

[Use Data migration tool to migrate your data to Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/import-data)
<br>This tutorial provides instructions on using the Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration tool, which can import data from various sources into Azure Cosmos containers and tables. You can import from JSON files, CSV files, SQL, MongoDB, Azure Table storage, Amazon DynamoDB, and even Azure Cosmos DB SQL API collections. You migrate that data to collections and tables for use with Azure Cosmos DB. The Data Migration tool can also be used when migrating from a single partition collection to a multi-partition collection for the SQL API.

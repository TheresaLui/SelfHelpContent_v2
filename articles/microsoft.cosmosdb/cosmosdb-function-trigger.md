# Azure Functions with Cosmos DB and database triggers

This article covers the most common issues with Azure Cosmos DB database triggers and Azure Functions.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Database triggers**<br>
Registered triggers must be explicitly called when a corresponding operation (e.g., create, delete, replace, update) happens. Registered triggers do not run automatically.  

Azure Cosmos DB supports two types of triggers:
* [Pre-triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers)
<br>Azure Cosmos DB provides triggers that you can invoke by performing an operation on an Azure Cosmos item. For example, you can specify a pre-trigger when you create an item. In this case, the pre-trigger will run before the item is created. Pre-triggers cannot have input parameters. If necessary, use the request object to update the document body from the original request. When triggers are registered, users can specify the operations it runs with. If a trigger was created with `TriggerOperation.Create`, this means using the trigger in a replace operation will not be permitted. For examples, see the [How to write triggers article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers).

* [Post-triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#post-triggers)
<br>Similar to pre-triggers, post-triggers are also associated with an operation on an Azure Cosmos item and do not permit input parameters. Post-triggers run after the operation is completed, and have access to the response message sent to the client. For examples, see the [How to write triggers article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#post-triggers).

### **Azure Functions trigger for Cosmos DB** 
<br>This section applies to the [Azure Functions trigger for Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger).

**Important:** Always make sure that you are running the latest version of the [Azure Cosmos DB Extension package for Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-changefeed-functions#dependencies)  

### **Function not receiving any, or only a partial set of, changes**  

**Availability**
<br>The Azure Functions trigger for Cosmos DB currently reads the **Change Feed** through the Core (SQL) API. Mongo, Cassandra, and Table accounts are not yet supported. If you use any of these APIs, the trigger is not expected to work.

**Connectivity**
<br>Verify that your Azure Cosmos account [firewall configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-firewall) has Azure datacenters enabled or the Virtual Network your Function App is associated with (in case you are working with [App Service or Premium Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#hosting-plan-support)) is allowed.  

<br>Verify that Azure datacenters are enabled in the [firewall configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-firewall) for your Azure Cosmos account. Alternatively, if you are working with an [App Service or Premium Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#hosting-plan-support)make sure that you use a permitted Virtual Network in association with your Function App. 

**Partition key configuration**
<br>If your Azure Functions trigger is copying documents over to another Cosmos DB container with **Upsert** operations, make sure that the **Partition Key** definitions of both the monitored container and destination container are the same. If these don't match, multiple documents from the monitored container may be saved as a single document in the destination.

**Error handling**
<br>The Azure Functions trigger for Cosmos DB, by default, won't retry a batch of changes if an unhandled exception occurs during your code execution. This means, when your Function receives a batch of changes, execution can stop and lose part of the batch if not handled correctly. Include try/catch blocks in your Function's code, especially within any loop. This ensures that any failure in processing one document does not exit the loop. 

**Multiplicity**
<br>The most common scenario, once connectivity and availability problems have been ruled out, is having multiple Azure Functions listening to the *same Monitored container* and using the *same Lease container*. When two or more Triggers share the same monitored and lease container, the locking and load balancing algorithm will probably let one of them own the leases, while leaving the other Function out. This is expected, as these configurations should not be duplicated in multiple Triggers.
* If you want multiple Triggers to work independently while listening for changes in the same Monitored container and sharing the same Lease container for cost optimizations, you need to [configure them with different Prefixes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-cosmos-db-trigger-logs)
* If you are unclear about extra Azure Functions running, but you do know how many Azure Function App instances you have running, inspect your Lease container and count the number of lease documents within. The distinct values of the **Owner** property in them should be equal to the number of instances of your Function App. If there are more Owners than the known Azure Function App instances, the extra owners are effectively stealing the changes. To mitigate the situation, [configure a different Prefix](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-cosmos-db-trigger-logs).

### **Delay in receiving changes**
The rate at which the changes are delivered to your Function depends greatly on the speed at which your Function processes each batch. If the rate at which the changes are happening in the Monitored container is greater than the rate at which your Function processes them, there will be an increasing lag.  

1. Is your Azure Function deployed in the same region as your Azure Cosmos account? For optimal network latency, both the Azure Function and your Azure Cosmos account should be co-located in the same Azure region.
2. Are the changes happening in your Azure Cosmos container continuous or sporadic? If it's the latter, there could be some delay between the changes being stored and the Azure Function picking them up. If the trigger checks for changes in your Azure Cosmos container and finds none pending to be read, it will sleep for a configurable amount of time (5 seconds, by default) before checking for new changes to avoid high RU consumption. To change this, configure sleep time through the **FeedPollDelay/feedPollDelay** setting in the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger?tabs=csharp#configuration) of your trigger.
3. Your Azure Cosmos container might be [rate-limited](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/request-units)
4. You can use the `PreferredLocations` attribute in your trigger to specify a comma-separated list of Azure regions to define a custom preferred connection order, in cases where your Azure Cosmos DB account has multiple regions.
5. Measure and [monitor the Function execution time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring). To maintain the order of the events, the Azure Functions trigger can only send new changes to be processed after you are done processing the current batch of changes. If your Function execution is taking several seconds,  follow the [Azure Functions Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices) and optimize the Function.

### **PartitionKey must be supplied for this operation***
This error means that you are currently using a partitioned lease container with an old extension dependency. To solve this issue, update to the latest [extension dependency version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-changefeed-functions#dependencies). If you are running on Azure Functions V1 (using the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB` package), you need to migrate to Azure Functions V2 or greater and use `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB`.

### **What happens on a Function restart?**
The Azure Cosmos DB trigger uses the lease container to store the state and the latest processed point in time on the Change Feed. If your Function restarts or you manually stop it and start it at a later time, it will continue from the saved point in time and pick up the changes that happened after. Based on the behavior of the [Change Feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed), only the latest version of a document (in case a document received multiple changes) will be read.

## **Using the Azure Cosmos DB SDK in Azure Functions**
<br>This section refers to using the Cosmos DB SDK to perform operations in the context of an Azure Function. 

### **Functions Host restart**  
[Azure Functions Host has limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#service-limits) regarding the number of connections, memory utilization, and execution timeout.
<br>If the Host is restarting it could be related to a violation of one of these limits.
<br>In the case of the Cosmos DB SDK the most common cause is not using the client as a **singleton** instance. Valid options are:
1. Use a [static client](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/manage-connections#static-clients) instance.
1. Leverage [Dependency Injection on Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-dependency-injection) to initialize and reuse the same client instance.

### **401 - UnauthorizedException**
This error is often related to using an invalid authorization key or credential. 
1. Verify that the Key being used is valid. If you are reading the Key or Connection String from an external source, like Azure Key Vault, verify the information there is up-to-date.
1. If there was a recent key rotation on the account, ensure you went with the [recommended procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data#key-rotation). When using any old or new key there is a window of time where the key might not be valid.

### **Other issues**
For any other issues, see the **SDK (SQL API) Issues - Error or unexpected result** problem type. Azure Functions is mainly the execution environment. The issue might be a generic SDK issue, which is covered in the general troubleshooting.

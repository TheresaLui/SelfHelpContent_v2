# Introduction to server-side programming in Azure Cosmos DB

The creation and execution of database triggers, stored procedures, and custom query operators is supported through the Azure portal, the REST API, and client SDKs in many platforms including .NET, Node.js and JavaScript.

## **Recommended Documents**

Refer to below documents for an overview of server-side programming in Azure Cosmos DB which includes samples on how to write stored procedures. If your stored procedure times out or has been blocked for high resource consumption, follow best practices below to optimize the code:

* [Azure Cosmos DB server-side programming: Stored procedures, database triggers, and UDFs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs)
* [Bounded execution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#bounded-execution)

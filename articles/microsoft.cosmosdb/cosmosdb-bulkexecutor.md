# Azure Cosmos DB bulk executor library
Most users are able to resolve their Cosmos DB bulk executor issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

Azure Cosmos DB is a fast, flexible, and globally distributed database service that is designed to elastically scale out to support:

* Large read and write throughput (millions of operations per second).
* Storing high volumes of (hundreds of terabytes, or even more) transactional and operational data with predictable millisecond latency.

The bulk executor library helps you leverage this massive throughput and storage. The bulk executor library allows you to perform bulk operations in Azure Cosmos DB through bulk import and bulk update APIs. You can read more about the features of bulk executor library in the following sections.

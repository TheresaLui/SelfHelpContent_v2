# Manage an Azure Cosmos account
Most users are able to resolve their Account provisioning or management case using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Not able to remove or add a region**  
If you are not able to remove a region in your database account please consider the following solutions:  
* In a single-region write mode, you cannot remove the write region. You must fail over to a different region before you can delete the current write region. [Perform manual failover on an Azure Cosmos account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-manage-database-account#manual-failover).
* In a multi-region write mode, you can add or remove any region, if you have at least one region.
* You cannot change another account property while adding or removing a region. To remedy, change the other account properties first, then retry the region change. You can compare property values by exporting the account to a template and compare currently property values from those set by your template, including tags.


### **Not able to delete an account**  
If after attempting to delete an account, you observe that nothing seems to happen and the account persists:  
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on the account.  You can verify this by navigating to the *Account* blade, selecting the account, and then view *Locks*.
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on your resource group. You can verify this by navigating to the *Resource Group* blade, select the resource where the account is located, and then view *Locks*.  


### **Not able to delete a resource group**  
If you are not able to delete a resource group, please consider the following solutions:  
* Verify if there is a *lock* on an account located in the resource group that is preventing it from being deleted. You can verify this by navigating to the *Account* blade, selecting the account, and then view *Locks*.
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on your resource group. You can verify this by navigating to the *Resource Group* blade, select the resource where the account is located, and then view *Locks*.
* You also may have a lock on an additional items located within the resource group.  It is recommended to review the items for any enabled *Delete Locks*.

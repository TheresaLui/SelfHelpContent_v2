# Manage an Azure Cosmos account
Most users are able to resolve their Account provisioning or management issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Not able to create a new account or add a region (COVID-19)**
As companies operationalize to address new and unique challenges, we have mobilized our global response plan to help customers stay up and running during this critical time. We are actively monitoring performance and usage trends 24/7 to ensure we are optimizing our services for customers worldwide, while accommodating new demand. We are working closely with first responder organizations and critical government agencies to ensure we are prioritizing their unique needs and providing them our fullest support. We are also partnering with governments around the globe to ensure our local datacenters have on-site staffing and all functions are running properly.

As demand continues to grow, if we are faced with any capacity constraints in any region during this time, we have established clear criteria for the priority of new cloud capacity. Top priority will be going to first responders, health and emergency management services, critical government infrastructure organizational use, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running with the core functionality of Teams. We will also consider adjusting free offers, as necessary, to ensure support of existing customers.

You may run into capacity constraints when performing the following operations:

- Provision/Create new Cosmos DB Account
- Adding a region to an existing Cosmos DB Account
- Provision a new Azure Cosmos DB Free Tier account

However, you should be able to perform all operations against your existing Azure Cosmos DB resources in all regions without any restrictions.

For further information, please review our [commitment and service continuity](https://aka.ms/Covid19Update).

If this is very critical for your business to have a new account or adding a region to an existing account, please continue creating a support ticket to explore other options.  

**Note** : If you are having issues other than the operations listed above, please continue with the below information to see if that helps resolve your issue.

### **Not able to remove or add a region**  
If you are not able to remove a region in your database account please consider the following solutions:  
* In a single-region write mode, you cannot remove the write region. You must fail over to a different region before you can delete the current write region. [Perform manual failover on an Azure Cosmos account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-manage-database-account#manual-failover).
* In a multi-region write mode, you can add or remove any region, if you have at least one region
* You cannot change another account property while adding or removing a region. To remedy, change the other account properties first, then retry the region change. You can compare property values by exporting the account to a template and compare currently property values from those set by your template, including tags.


### **Not able to delete an account**  
If after attempting to delete an account, you observe that nothing seems to happen and the account persists:  
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on the account.  You can verify this by navigating to the *Account* blade, selecting the account, and then view *Locks*.
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on your resource group. You can verify this by navigating to the *Resource Group* blade, select the resource where the account is located, and then view *Locks*.  


### **Not able to delete a resource group**  
If you are not able to delete a resource group, please consider the following solutions:  
* Verify if there is a *lock* on an account located in the resource group that is preventing it from being deleted. You can verify this by navigating to the *Account* blade, selecting the account, and then view *Locks*.
* Verify if you have a *delete lock* enabled on your resource group. You can verify this by navigating to the *Resource Group* blade, select the resource where the account is located, and then view *Locks*.
* You also may have a lock on an additional items located within the resource group.  It is recommended to review the items for any enabled *Delete Locks*.  

### **Unable to update Consistency as well as disable multi-region writes**
With VNET enabled accounts, the selected user making changes to the account must have permissions on the VNET:
* Add the necessary permissions to the desired user to make changes or assign another user with the expected permissions to update the consistency

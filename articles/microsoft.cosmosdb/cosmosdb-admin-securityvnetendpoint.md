# Azure Cosmos DB Security Permissions and Role Based Access Control

## FAQ

### How do I get the primary/secondary read/write keys in a programmatic, safe, and secure way?

There are two recommended ways to get your keys to learn more:

* [How to use a system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Cosmos DB data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/managed-identity-based-authentication)
* [Certificate-based authentication with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/certificate-based-authentication)

### What are roles I should know about, and where can I go to learn more:

* Roles to know:
  * _DocumentDB Account Contributor_ role, at a high level, allows the assigned account to manage Azure Cosmos DB accounts and allows retrieval of read/write keys. For more information please see [DocumentDB-Account-Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#documentdb-account-contributor).
  * _Cosmos DB Account Reader_ role, at a high level, allows the assigned account to read all Azure Cosmos DB account data, and can retrieve the read keys. For more information please see [Cosmos DB Account Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#cosmos-db-account-reader-role)
  * _Cosmos DB Operator_ - allows the assigned account to manage Azure Cosmos DB Accounts but not access the data in them. For more information please see [Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#cosmos-db-operator).
  * _Contributor_  allows the assigned account to contribute to Azure Cosmos DB. For more information please see [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor).

* To learn more:
      * [Azure Built in Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles)
      * [Cosmos DB Specific Built in Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control)

* If you want fine grained control over roles and want to create your own:
  * [Custom Roles in Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control#custom-roles)

>[!NOTE] CosmosDb and DocumentDb AAD namespaces are aliases for each other.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Role Based Access Control**

* For a listing of the built-in RBAC roles for Azure Cosmos DB see [Role-based access control in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control)
* For a listing of all operations that can be configured for a custom RBAC role, see [Azure Cosmos DB Resource Provider Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftdocumentdb)
* Please note, role assignments are scoped to **control-plane access only**, as defined above. Data plane operations, including queries and all CRUD operations on data stored within Azure Cosmos DB are secured using master keys, resource tokens, Azure Key Vault or using a certificate-based approach as shown below. To learn more, see [Secure access to data in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data).
* Users can use managed identities to secure access to the master keys for Azure Cosmos DB and allow for safe key rotation. To learn more see, [How to use a system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Cosmos DB data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/managed-identity-based-authentication)
* Finally, users can choose to implement a certificate-based authentication for an Azure AD identity to allow users to access access data within Azure Cosmos DB without having to distribute the master keys. For more information on how to implement this see, [Certificate-based authentication with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/certificate-based-authentication).

### **Cannot load a document in Data explorer: Error 401**

Error Message: *The input authorization token can't serve the request. Please check that the expected payload is built as per the protocol, and check the key being used.*

* First verify the expected payload is as per the protocol you are using
* If you are experiencing this error in Data Explorer when using special character encodings in the id, this is a current known issue. Please use the [Sunset Link](https://cosmos.azure.com/sunset) as a workaround.

## **Recommended Documents**

[How to create a custom RBAC role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)
<br>If the built-in roles for Azure resources don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own custom roles. This article covers how you can create and assign custom roles to users, groups, and service principals at subscription, resource group, and resource scopes.  

[Azure Cosmos DB Security Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/database-security)
<br>This article discusses database security best practices and key features offered by Azure Cosmos DB to help you prevent, detect, and respond to database breaches.  

[Azure Cosmos DB Resource Provider Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftdocumentdb)
<br>This article lists the operations available for each Azure Resource Manager resource provider. These operations can be used in custom roles to provide granular role-based access control (RBAC) to resources in Azure.  

[How to use a system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Cosmos DB data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/managed-identity-based-authentication)
<br>Gone are the days of copying and pasting keys. Use managed identities to unlock a **robust, key rotation agnostic** solution to get your Azure Cosmos DB keys on demand. From there you can use the keys to access your Azure Cosmos DB's databases, containers, and items.

[Certificate-based authentication with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/certificate-based-authentication)
<br>Certificate-based authentication enables your client application to be authenticated by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with a client certificate. You can perform certificate-based authentication on a machine where you need an identity, such as an on-premises machine or virtual machine in Azure.

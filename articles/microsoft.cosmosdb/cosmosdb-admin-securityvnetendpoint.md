# Connection failure after VNet service endpoint configuration
Most users are able to resolve their security and VNet case using the steps below.


## **Recommended Steps**

Please wait for 15-20 minutes before testing the connection through the VNet. You must re-enable the IP Firewall rule after you enable the Azure Virtual Network service endpoint.  

### **Unable to update Consistency as well as enable or disable multi-region writes**

* Add the necessary permissions to the desired user to make changes or assign another user with the expected permissions to update the consistency

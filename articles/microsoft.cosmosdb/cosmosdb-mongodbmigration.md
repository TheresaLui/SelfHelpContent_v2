# Import MongoDB data into Cosmos DB

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Migrating MongoDB Data to Cosmos DB**  

To migrate data from MongoDB to an Azure Cosmos DB account for use with the API for MongoDB, you must:

* Download either `mongoimport.exe` or `mongorestore.exe` from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).
* Get your [API for MongoDB connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/connect-mongodb-account).

**Note:** Throughput that you provision directly impacts the duration of migration. Consider increasing RUs during migration and scaling down after they complete. 

### **Updating MongoDB 3.2 to 3.6**  

The Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB is compatible with MongoDB server version **3.6** by default for new accounts.   

For existing accounts, navigate to the **Settings** > **Features** area of your Cosmos DB Mongo account. The option, Upgrade to Mongo server version 3.6, should be visible. 
- Option not visible: If this option does not appear for your account, file a support ticket request.  
- Option is visible: If the option is enabled for you, click **Enable** to start the migration. The migration status will show as **Pending** in the features list for up to several days. When the migration has completed, the account will show new connection strings in the portal with `<!--$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->[GlobalDatabaseAccountName]<!--/$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->.mongo.cosmos.azure.com`.

**Note:** What appears in the portal might differ if your account is in a Sovereign, Government, or Restricted Azure cloud.  

**Important Note:** Although 3.6 is generally compatible with 3.2, we recommend that a customer provisions a new account through the portal and selects the MongoDB server version 3.6 to try it out with their application on a dev or qa instance, before considering updating the account backing any production workload. 

### **Connecting to 3.6 after migration**

Note that when using Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB accounts, the 3.6 version of accounts have the endpoint in the format `<!--$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->[GlobalDatabaseAccountName]<!--/$GlobalDatabaseAccountName-->.mongo.cosmos.azure.com`, whereas the 3.2 version of accounts have the endpoint in the format `*.documents.azure.com`.

### **Using 3.2 and 3.6**
Upgrading to 3.6 does not mean that you have to stop using 3.2 style change feed. All features of 3.2 continue to be supported in 3.6. Even the 3.2 endpoint will remain operational for certain client applications that you want to keep on 3.2 for longer than others. The 3.6 update does not move or alter the data, because it occurs at the API and not the storage layer.

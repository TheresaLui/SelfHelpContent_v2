# Troubleshooting Azure virtual network connection 

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check that the Virtual Network Gateway that links to your Azure virtual network to CloudSimple is of type **ExpressRoute**
* Check if a gateway subnet created in the virtual network
* Check if ExpressRoute Gateway already connected to another ExpressRoute circuit in the same peering location
* Check that the correct connection type selected
* Check that the virtual network in the same location as the Virtual Network Gateway
* Check if there is a subnet overlap with the private cloud
* Check if the subnet overlaps with another peered virtual network
* Check if you are linking more than 10 virtual networks in a standard ExpressRoute Circuit

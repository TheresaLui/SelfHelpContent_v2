# Troubleshooting virtual machine performance 

## **Recommended Steps**

<span title="Problems related to VMware VM performance on my Private Cloud">

* Check vCenter events for a disconnected or not responsive ESXi host
* Check vSAN Health tests for vSAN resync'ing components
* Check vSAN Performance stats for high congestion or I/O that is persistently higher than total disks I/O
* Check vSAN storage policy for better configuration. e.g. larger stripe width or a better RAID type
* Check network IO Control (NIOC) configuration
* Check for I/O overhead due to features in use e.g. vSAN encryption, vSAN Checksum
* Ensure that there are no backup activities during peak I/O
* Ensure that there are no virtual machine snapshot operation during peak I/O
* Check the guest OS file system 4KB alignment
* Ensure that Memory Trimming feature is disabled on I/O intensive virtual machines that are not memory intensive
* Check for active On-demand virus scan activities in the virtual machine
* If using SQL Server, check for optimization tips

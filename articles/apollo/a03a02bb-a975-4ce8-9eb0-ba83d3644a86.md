# Troubleshooting creating directory or linking subscription 

## Troubleshoot Azure AD B2C directory and subscription issues

Use this article to resolve issues that occur when creating an Azure AD B2C directory or when linking subscriptions.

Azure Active Directory B2C (AAD B2C) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day. [Learn about more features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) and [try our demo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview#example-woodgrove-groceries).

See these instructions to [create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 

### Error: "The subscription is not registered to use namespace Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory" when creating a B2C tenant

Add `Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory` as a resource provider for the Azure subscription in use. See [Steps to Register resource provider via Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1). 

### Link an Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription 

You need to explicitly link an Azure AD B2C tenant to an Azure subscription by creating an Azure AD B2C resource within the target Azure subscription. See [Steps to link an Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/billing#create-the-link). 

### Unlink an Azure AD B2C tenant from the current subscription and link it to a new subscription 

* If the destination subscription exists within the same Azure Active Directory tenant, open AAD tenant > **All resources** > **Select Azure B2C tenant** > **Move** > **Move to another subscription**. 

* If the destination subscription is associated with different Azure Active Directory tenants, you can still achieve the same result by unlinking the AAD B2C tenant from the source subscription and relinking it to the destination subscription. This method is safe because the only object you delete is the billing link, not the AAD B2C tenant itself. 

### Role and access issues in subscription for an Azure AD B2C tenant 

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is the authorization system that you use to manage access to Azure resources. To grant access, you assign roles to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities at a particular scope. See [Steps to add or remove Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

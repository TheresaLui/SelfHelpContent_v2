# Configure Application Gateway with App Service

## Configure Application Gateway with App Service

App service is a multi-tenant service (versus a dedicated deployment). This means it uses the host header in the incoming request to resolve the request to the correct app service endpoint. However, the app service's domain name differs from the domain name of the Application Gateway that fronts the app service.
Therefore, you must enable the `Pick host name from backend address` switch to override the original host header in the request with the host name of the app service back-end when the request is routed from the Application Gateway to the backend. 

### Recommended steps

1. To configure Application Gateway with the app service as backend, see [How to configure app service with Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configure-web-app-portal)
2. If you configured your app service with Application Gateway and are experiencing issues, see [Troubleshoot app service issues with Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/troubleshoot-app-service-redirection-app-service-url)

# Resolve Metrics issues with Azure SQL Database

The Azure Portal enables monitoring of resource metrics for your Azure SQL Database. You can quickly monitor a variety of resource metrics, enabling you to see resource consumption at any given moment.

You can configure diagnostic settings to [stream categories of metrics and resource logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/metrics-diagnostic-telemetry-logging-streaming-export-configure?tabs=azure-portal#diagnostic-telemetry-for-export) for single databases, pooled databases, and elastic pools to one of the following Azure resources:
- [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs#collect-to-log-analytics-workspace)
  - Can be consumed by [SQL Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql)
  - Leverage other Azure Monitor features, such as alerts and visualizations
- [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs#send-to-azure-event-hubs)
  - Stream logs to third-party logging and telemetry systems
  - Build a custom telemetry and logging platform
  - View service health by streaming data to Power BI
- [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs#send-to-azure-storage)
  - Store data for longer periods
  - Low cost storage

You can enable and manage metrics and diagnostic telemetry logging by using one of the following methods:
- Azure Portal
- PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Azure Monitor REST API
- Azure Resource Manager template

## **Recommended Steps**

Most users are able to resolve their issues using the following steps.

:::Section Log Analytics workspace doesn't have metrics data:::

### Log Analytics workspace doesn't have metrics data

1. Confirm that the database is processing enough workload to consume resources
2. Please verify the Log Analytics scope is set correctly 
3. On lower-service tiers, the component responsible for uploading metrics can hit the resource limit and stop uploading metrics. Try scaling to a higher service tier, then scale back to the original service tier.

:::Section What are the supported metrics for Azure SQL Database:::
### Supported metrics 

- [Platform metrics: Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported#microsoftsqlserversdatabases)
- [Platform metrics: Elastic pools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported#microsoftsqlserverselasticpools)

:::Section How to monitor performance metrics:::
### Here are the options to monitor performance metrics

- [Monitor with SQL insights - Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-enable)

Azure Monitor SQL insights is a tool for monitoring Azure SQL managed instances, Azure SQL databases, and SQL Server instances in Azure SQL VMs. This service uses a remote agent to capture data from dynamic management views (DMVs) and routes the data to Azure Log Analytics, where it can be monitored and analyzed. You can view this data from Azure Monitor in provided views, or access the Log data directly to run queries and analyze trends. 

- [Query Performance Insight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/query-performance-insight-use) can be used to investigate if high resource usage is due to the workload

- [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/query-store-usage-scenarios?view=sql-server-ver15#identify-and-tune-top-resource-consuming-queries) can be used to identify and tune top resource-consuming queries

- [Monitor Performance using DMVs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/monitoring-with-dmvs#monitor-resource-use)

You can use [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database?view=azuresqldb-current) to monitor CPU, I/O, and memory consumption for an Azure SQL Database database

:::Section How to monitor metrics for Geo-secondary or read-only replicas:::
### How to monitor metrics for Geo-secondary or read-only replicas
- Monitor supported metrics using Metrics view in Azure Portal
- [Monitor read-only replicas using DMV](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/read-scale-out#monitoring-and-troubleshooting-read-only-replicas) 


:::Section "Error retrieving data" message on dashboard:::
This problem may happen if your dashboard was created with a metric that was later deprecated and removed from Azure. To verify that this is the case, open the Metrics tab of your resource, and check the available metrics in the metric picker. Update the failing tile by picking an alternative metric for your chart on the dashboard.

:::Section Chart shows dashed line:::
### Chart shows dashed line

Azure metrics charts use a dashed line to indicate that there is a missing value (also known as the _null value_) between two known time grain data points. The dashed line drops down to zero when the metric uses count and sum aggregation. For the average, minimum, or maximum aggregations, the dashed line connects the two nearest known data points.  

The dashed line makes reading of these charts easier. However, if your chart is still unclear, consider viewing your metrics with a different chart type.

:::Section How to digest the metrics:::
### How to digest the metrics

- Export the metrics to outside of Azure
  - The metrics can be [streamed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/metrics-diagnostic-telemetry-logging-streaming-export-configure?tabs=azure-portal#diagnostic-telemetry-for-export) to Azure Event Hubs and Azure Storage, from where they can be sent outside of Azure
  - On the Metrics tab, you can download the metrics presented to Excel. Select **Share** > **Download to Excel**.
  - Use [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/metrics/list) or [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetric?view=azps-4.7.0) to obtain the value of the metric that you want

- Configure [alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/alerts-insights-configure-portal) on the metrics to get notifications when metrics reach threshold.

## Resolve issues signing in to Microsoft applications

Resolve issues signing in to Microsoft applications by using insights from the following solutions.  

:::Section Resolve issues signing in to Microsoft application:::    

The following information will help you resolve most issues when signing in to Microsoft applications: 

* [Can’t sign in to a Microsoft application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-first-party-microsoft?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Apps_Sign_In_Support_L2_MicrosoftApp)
* [Windows Hello for Business Deployment - known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-deployment-issues#identifying-server-2019-key-trust-authentication-issue)

:::Section Resolve issues signing in to your applications by using Sign-in Diagnostic:::

Diagnose issues related to user sign-in by using the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom): 

1. Launch the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom)
2. Find the event that you want to analyze by entering information about the user, application, time of sign-in, request ID, or correlation ID
3. Review the diagnostic results that indicate the event details and what actions you can take to make changes, if needed

**Note:** This solution is available only to global administrators.

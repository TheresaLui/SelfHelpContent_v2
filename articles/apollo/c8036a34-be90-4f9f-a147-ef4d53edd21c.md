## Resolve Issues related to signing into applications developed by my company
Resolve sign-in issues using the insights from the below recommendations.

:::Section Run the Sign-in Diagnostic:::

Diagnose problems related to user sign-in by using the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom) (Only available if you are a global admin)

1. Run the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom)
2. Find the event you want to analyze by entering details about the user, application, time of sign-in, request ID, or correlation ID
3. Review the diagnostic results showing the details of what happened and what actions you can take to make changes (if needed)

:::Section Troubleshoot Single sign-on configuration issues :::

The following information will help you resolve most SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configuration issues in Azure Active Directory.   

### Test single sign-On configuration with Azure AD
The following video shows how to test SAML settings, find root cause of sign-in issues and get resolution guidance in Azure portal

### Review error codes, root causes, and solutions 

| Error code | Resolution guidance | Troubleshooting document |
|:--|:--|:--|
| AADSTS50011 | The reply address is missing, misconfigured, or doesn't match the reply addresses configured for the app. Add the missing reply address to the Azure Active Directory application or have someone with the permissions to manage your application in Active Directory do this for you | [Reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch) |
| AADSTS650056 |The client lists no permissions in the requested permissions in the client's application registration, or the admin has not consented in the tenant. Check the application identifier in the request to ensure it matches the configured client application identifier. Contact your admin to fix the configuration, or consent on behalf of the tenant. |  [Misconfigured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app) |
| AADSTS70001 | Ensure that the `Issuer` attribute in the SAML request matches the `Identifier` value configured in Azure AD. On the SAML-based SSO configuration page, in the Basic SAML configuration section, verify that the **Identifier** value matches the one displayed in the error. | [Application with Identifier was not found in the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory)  
| AADSTS50105 | The user has not been granted access to the application in Azure AD. See [Quickstart: Assign users to an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users) | [The signed in user is not assigned to a role for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50105-user-not-assigned-role) |
| AADSTS750054 | Azure AD wasn’t able to identify the SAML request within the URL parameters in the HTTP request. This can happen if the application is not using the required HTTP redirect binding when sending the SAML request. Read the section *HTTP Redirect Binding* in the [SAML protocol specification document](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf) | [SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts750054-saml-request-not-present)
| AADSTS75011 | The user authenticated using a method that doesn't match requested authentication method for the service. **RequestedAuthnContext** is an optional value. Ask the application if it can be removed. Alternatively, request a fresh authentication in which the SAML request contains the value **forceAuthn="true"** to ensure the **RequestedAuthnContext** is honored. The fresh authentication will also honor **AuthnContext**.  |  [Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts75011-auth-method-mismatch) |

The resources here can help you resolve the enterprise app-related issues: admin consent, publisher verification, SAML certificates, and more. 

:::Section Diagnose sign-in issues:::

Diagnose problems related to user sign-in with the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom) (Only available if you are a global admin).

1. Run the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom)
2. Find the event you want to analyze by entering details about the user, application, time of sign-in, request ID, or correlation ID
3. Review the diagnostic results that show details of what happened and actions you can take, if needed

**Can't find your apps or you see unknown apps**

* If you can’t find the app under **App Registration**, it might be a multi-tenant app registered in another tenant. You can find your app in the **Enterprise Apps** blade after it has been accessed and consented, and the [service principal has been created in your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals).
* If you're the **owner** and can’t find the app under **App Registration**, you have two options:
  * [Assign admin role to the owner for only that specific application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)
  * [Disable the setting 'Restrict access to Azure admin portal'](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

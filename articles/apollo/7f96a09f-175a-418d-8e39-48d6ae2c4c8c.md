# Configure Application Gateway with App Service

## Configure Application Gateway with App Service

Since app service is a multi-tenant service (versus a dedicated deployment), it uses the host header in the incoming request to resolve the request to the correct app service endpoint. Because the domain name of the Application Gateway that fronts the app service differs from the app service's domain name, you must enable the `Pick host name from backend address` switch. This overrides the original host header in the request with the host name of the app service back-end when the request is routed from the Application Gateway to the backend.

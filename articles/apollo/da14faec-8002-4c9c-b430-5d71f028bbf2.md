# Unhealthy backend pool

## Troubleshooting unhealthy backend pool

When all of the servers in a backend pool are unhealthy, Application Gateway has no healthy servers to forward client requests to.
These issues can stem from the health probe configuration in Application Gateway or your backend server, which fails to give a healthy response. In this case, the clients will receive a "502 Bad Gateway" error to signify that no active servers are available to accept the requests.

### Recommended steps

To troubleshoot 502 Bad Gateway errors, follow these steps:

1. Visit [Back-end health troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#back-end-health) to learn about troubleshooting steps for each error message.
2. Alternatively, you can check the detailed error message by using Azure PowerShell, CLI, or REST API. For more information, see [Back-end health and diagnostic logs for Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#back-end-health).

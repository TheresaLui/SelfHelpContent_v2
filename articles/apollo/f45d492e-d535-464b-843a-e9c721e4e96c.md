## **Recommended Steps**  

**I’m having trouble accessing my application and getting Admin consent related errors** 

* I want to [Configure Admin consent workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) and [Grant tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#:~:text=The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API.&text=before%20granting%20consent.-,The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is%20required%20in%20order%20to%20provide,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API)
* [Evaluate a request for tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests#evaluating-a-request-for-tenant-wide-admin-consent) & [Manage user and admin permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-application-permissions)

* [I see unexpected error when performing consent to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-unexpected-user-consent-error)
* Remove ‘prompt =consent’ setting from the application (if present), so it doesn't cause required consent to go on a loop between admin consent and user request for the app
* [How do I ensure that the application is publisher verified to avoid consent errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview)

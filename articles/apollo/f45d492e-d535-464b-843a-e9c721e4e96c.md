### Common error codes

| Error code | Summary |
|:--|:--|
| AADSTS50011  | The reply address is missing, misconfigured, or does not match reply addresses configured for the app. As a resolution, ensure to add this missing reply address to the Azure Active Directory application or have someone with the permissions to manage your application in Active Directory do this for you. [See more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch). |
| AADSTS650056  | The `Issuer` attribute sent from the application to Azure AD in the SAML request doesn’t match the `Identifier` value configured for the application in Azure AD. Ensure that the Issuer attribute in the SAML request matches the Identifier value configured in Azure AD. Verify that the value in the Identifier textbox matches the value for the identifier value displayed in the error. [See more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app). |
| AADSTS70001  | UnauthorizedClient - The application is disabled. To learn more, see the troubleshooting article for errors. [See more info](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory). |
| AADSTS50105  | The user has not been granted access to the application in Azure AD. To assign one or more users to an application directly, see [Quickstart: Assign users to an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users). [See more information about this error](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50105-user-not-assigned-role). |
| AADSTS750054 | Azure AD wasn’t able to identify the SAML request within the URL parameters in the HTTP request. This can happen if the application isn't using the required HTTP redirect binding when sending the SAML request to Azure AD. For more information about how to implement it, read the section *HTTP Redirect Binding* in the [SAML protocol specification document](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf). [See more information about this error](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts750054-saml-request-not-present). |
| AADSTS75011 | The authentication method the user used to authenticate the service doesn't match the requested authentication method. **RequestedAuthnContext** is an optional value. Then, if possible, ask the application if it can be removed. Alternatively, to make sure the RequestedAuthnContext is honored, request a fresh authentication. When the SAML request is processed, a fresh authentication will be done and the **AuthnContext** will be honored. To request a Fresh Authentication the SAML request most contain the value **forceAuthn="true"**. [See more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts75011-auth-method-mismatch). |

**Issues accessing an application and Admin consent-related errors** 

* [Configure admin consent workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) and [Grant tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#:~:text=The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API.&text=before%20granting%20consent.-,The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is%20required%20in%20order%20to%20provide,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API)
* [Evaluate a request for tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests#evaluating-a-request-for-tenant-wide-admin-consent) and [Manage user and admin permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-application-permissions)

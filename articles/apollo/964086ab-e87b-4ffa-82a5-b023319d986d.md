### Error codes and troubleshooting resources

| Error code | Description | Solution | 
|:--|:--|:--| 
| AADSTS50011 | The reply address is missing, misconfigured, or doesn't match reply addresses configured for the app. As a resolution, ensure to add this missing reply address to the Azure Active Directory application or have someone with the permissions to manage your application in Active Directory do this for you | [The reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch) | 
| AADSTS650056 |The client hasn't listed any permissions in the requested permissions in the client's application registration. Or, The admin has not consented in the tenant. Or, Check the application identifier in the request to ensure it matches the configured client application identifier. Please contact your admin to fix the configuration or consent on behalf of the tenant." when trying to sign into a SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured app that has been integrated with Azure AD |  [Misconfigured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app) | 
| AADSTS70001 | Ensure that the Issuer attribute in the SAML request matches the Identifier value configured in Azure AD. On the SAML-based SSO configuration page, in the Basic SAML configuration section, verify that the value in the Identifier textbox matches the value for the identifier value displayed in the error | [Application with Identifier was not found in the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory)   
| AADSTS50105 | The user has not been granted access to the application in Azure AD.To assign one or more users to an application directly, see [Quickstart: Assign users to an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users) | [The signed in user is not assigned to a role for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50105-user-not-assigned-role) | 
| AADSTS750054 | Azure AD wasn’t able to identify the SAML request within the URL parameters in the HTTP request. This can happen if the application is not using the required HTTP redirect binding when sending the SAML request to Azure AD. For more information about how to implement this, read the section *HTTP Redirect Binding* in the [SAML protocol specification document](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf) | [SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts750054-saml-request-not-present) 
| AADSTS75011 | The authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method. **RequestedAuthnContext** is an optional value. Then, if possible, ask the application if it could be removed. Alternatively, make sure the **RequestedAuthnContext** is honored by requesting a fresh authentication. When the SAML request is processed, a fresh authentication will be done and the **AuthnContext** will be honored. To request a fresh authentication the SAML request most contain the value **forceAuthn="true"** |  [Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts75011-auth-method-mismatch) | 

:::Section Diagnose sign-in issues::: 

The Sign-in Diagnostic can help global admins target user sign-in issues. 

[Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom)
 
1. Start the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom) 
2. Find the event you want to analyze by entering details about the user, application, time of sign-in, request ID, or correlation ID 
3. Review the diagnostic results showing the details of what happened and what actions you can take to make changes (if needed)

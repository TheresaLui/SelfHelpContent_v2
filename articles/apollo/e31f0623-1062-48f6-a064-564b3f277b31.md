### Recommended Steps
To resolve Network Security Group (NSG) issues, work through the following steps. 
Note that, NSGs, by default, deny connections from the Internet unless they are explicitly allowed. 

1. Use <a data-blade="microsoft_azure_network.verifyipflowblade.id.$subscriptionId" button-data-blade="button-data-blade">
   IP flow verify
</a>â€‹ to confirm if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking traffic to or from a virtual machine
2. Edit the [Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group) to make changes to the rules if needed.
3. If there is no rule to allow remote RDP traffic, review [Unable to connect via RDP due to NSG](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-rdp-nsg-problem)<br>
4. If there is no rule to allow the traffic from Internet, add a new rule to allow access to the backend port, with source being 'Internet', '\*' or a specific public IP address
5. Try using [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to connect to your VM. [Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) provides secure and seamless RDP connectivity to your virtual machine directly in the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machine does not need a public IP address, or inbound NSG rule allowing RDP traffic.

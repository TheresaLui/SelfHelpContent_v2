# Is the NIC of the destination VM in succeeded state?

Make sure that the NIC of the destination VM is in a succeeded state.

## Recommended Steps

1. Open the destination VM in ASC
2. Go to Networking
3. Confirm if the status of the NIC is in a succeeded state
**Note:** If there is more than one NIC(s), make sure that the NIC holding the Private IP address that the customer is trying to reach is in a Succeeded state
 
If the destination VM is a Windows machine, also check if the NIC status is in the OS is OK as well:
1. Open the Diagnostics tab of the VM in ASC
2. Create a screenshot of the VM
3. The VM screenshot shows that the OS is fully loaded, but there's no network (there is a red cross on the NIC)

Reset the NIC of the VM

## Recommended Steps

1. Ask the customer to reset the NIC of the VM and check if they can connect to it after doing this
2. Check the status of the NIC once again to make sure the state is Succeeded

If the status is succeeded, but the screenshot of the VM still shows the the adapter is failed (red "X") after you asked the customer to reset it, you can collaborate with the Windows Team. To troubleshoot the issue yourself, see the following link.

# Proceed with OS level troubleshooting on destination VM

Proceed with taking a packet capture on both source and destination VM and engage a TA. If after reviewing the packet capture you believe the issue is caused by an OS level issue on either source or destination VM, you can reach out to the Windows/Linux teams to assist you with troubleshooting further.

# Proceed with OS level troubleshooting on destination VM

Take a packet capture on both the source and destination VMs and engage a TA. After reviewing the packet capture, if you think the issue is caused by an OS level issue on either the source or destination VM, reach out to the Windows/Linux teams for further troubleshooting.

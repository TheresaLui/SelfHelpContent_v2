# Application must be listening on the specified port 

<!--issueDescription-->

<!--issueDescription-->
Our investigation has determined that no application is listening on port number <port #> on <destination VM>. To connect to this port, an application needs to be listening on it.
Make sure that the application that you are trying to connect to is started and configured to listen on this port on all IP addresses associated with the VM.

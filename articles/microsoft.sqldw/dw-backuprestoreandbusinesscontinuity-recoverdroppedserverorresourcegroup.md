# Recovering a dropped server

If you delete an Azure SQL Warehouse server, all data warehouses are also deleted and cannot be recovered.

File a support ticket to attempt recovery of the dropped server. Best chances of recovery are if:

* A server with the same name has not been created
* The server was dropped less than 7 days ago

To learn how to avoid business interruptions you can review the capabilities that Azure SQL Database provides for [business continuity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/backup-and-restore).

## **Recommended Steps**

Check if the databases under the server can be recovered using supported features:

* If the server still exists you can [restore deleted databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-deleted-dw) from the Azure portal, PowerShell, or REST APIs

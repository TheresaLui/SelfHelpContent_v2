# Troubleshooting automated backups

## **Recommended Steps**

* Azure SQL Data Warehouse takes a snapshot of your data warehouse every 8 hours
* You can restore the data warehouse from any one of snapshots taken
* The user doesn't have to enable this capability
* Automatic restore points are available for 7 days. If you require restore points longer than 7 days, please vote for this capabilityÂ [here](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/307516-sql-data-warehouse/suggestions/35114410-user-defined-retention-periods-for-restore-points).
* Automatic restore points can't be deleted by the user. SQL Data Warehouse deletes a restore point when it hits the 7-day retention period and when there are at least 42 restore points (user-defined as well as automatic).
Snapshots are not taken when the data warehouse is paused.
* If a snapshot is taken and the data warehouse is paused for more than 7 days and then resumed, it is possible for the restore point to persist longer than 7 days until there are 42 total restore points. Backups don't occur when the data warehouse is paused so the storage cost for backup should remain constant during this time.

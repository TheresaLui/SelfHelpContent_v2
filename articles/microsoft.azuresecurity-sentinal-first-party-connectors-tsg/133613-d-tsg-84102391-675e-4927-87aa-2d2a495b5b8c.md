"Connected/"Not Connected" connector:
Relevant for all of this connectors family- The only way for us to know if the connector is active is to see it in the customer's workspace. If no new data has been received in the last 14 days, the connector will display as being "not connected." When the connector will receive data , the "connected" (green color) status will return.
 
 
No data is received:
1. Go to the specific Azure service diagnostic settings and validate the status there.
2. Check if there is a dedicated diagnostic setting which is set to send the logs to the relevant Sentinel workspace.
3. If the customer is using the built-in policy that we provided in the connector page- we supposed to see a dedicated diagnostic setting that was automatically created by the policy.
  
 
How can I see my policy assignment?
1. Go to Azure Policy blade in the portal (out of Sentinel).
2. You can see all customer's active policy assignments in the Compliance blade 
The Compliance state indicates the status of the policy (Not started, Compliance, Non-compliance, etc.)

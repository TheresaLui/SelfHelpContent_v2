# Failure to add a tenant possible solution

1. Make sure port 4433 is open for web traffic.
		a. Workaround- if port is not open in a certain machine customer can try from a different one
2. Make sure user is administrator in the tenant
3. For Office there is a special consent process through AAD.  Ask customer where the problem is?  If they weren't able to enter their credentials and didn't get a consent window the problem probably is with AAD.
	Run the query bellow and see if there are any results.  Issue is under results description.

	ServiceFabricDynamicOE 
| where serviceTypeName == "OfficeOnboardingServiceType"
| where operationName == "AsiRP.OfficeOnboardingService.OnboardTenantAsync"
| where customData contains <workspaceId>
| where resultType == "Failure"

If there is an issue with the AAD connection the AAD error should be there.  These are public errors that AAD document so you can search for them.

If the error is transient please ask customer to try again

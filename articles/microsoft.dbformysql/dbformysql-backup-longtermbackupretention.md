# Long term backup retention for Azure Database for MySQL

**Retention less than 7 days or beyond 35 days?** The default [backup retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-backup) period is 7 days and can be increased up to 35 days. In Azure MySQL Single server, you can't set retention for less than 7 days or beyond 35 days. But you can [Automate backups of your Azure Database for MySQL server to azure storage for longer term retention](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/automate-backups-of-your-azure-database-for-mysql-server-to/ba-p/1791157). For Azure Database for MySQL Flexible servers, you can reduce the backup period to minimum 1 day.

Long-term retention backups are currently not natively supported by the service. You have the option to use **mysqldump** to take backups and store them for long-term retention. Third-party solutions are available.

The Azure engineering team is currently working on native support for long-term retention backups.

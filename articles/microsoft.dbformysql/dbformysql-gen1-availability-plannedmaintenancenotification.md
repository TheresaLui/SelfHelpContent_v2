# Planned maintenance notification in Azure Databases for MySQL - Single Server

A planned maintenance is a maintenance window when service updates are deployed to servers in a given Azure region. During planned maintenance, a notification event is created to inform customers when the service update is deployed in the Azure region hosting their servers.

## **Recommended Steps**

* After the notification is sent to a given Azure region, the patching schedule changes cannot be made for an individual server in that region. The patch is rolled out to all servers in the entire region in the same planned maintenance deployment process.
* Regions are not patched at the same time. Maintenance deployments are typically completed overnight to avoid work hours, typically 5 PM - 8 AM, although the exact start and end times can vary
* You can receive alerts for upcoming planned maintenance using:

  * Alerts: You can configure alerts for an upcoming planned maintenance event. Refer to [how can I get notified of planned maintenance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-planned-maintenance-notification#how-can-i-get-notified-of-planned-maintenance) to configure alerts.
  * Azure portal: Refer to [planned maintenance notification from Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-planned-maintenance-notification#check-planned-maintenance-notification-from-azure-portal) for more details.

* Typically, the minimum duration between two planned maintenance is 30 days. You receive a notification of the next maintenance window 72 hours in advance
* Planned maintenance for a given Azure region is typically expected to run 15 hrs. During this time, Azure Database for MySQL single servers are restarted and restarts are typically expected to complete in 60-120 seconds.

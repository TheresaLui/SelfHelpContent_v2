There are several use cases where you will see your VM scheduled for maintenance after you have already completed your maintenance-redeploy:
* You VM was service healed to another node, which has not been updated yet, due to a hardware fault.
* You stopped (deallocatedâ€‹) and restarted the VM, and it landed on a host that was not updated.
* You have auto shutdown set on the VM, and when it restarted, it was placed on a host that was not yet updated.

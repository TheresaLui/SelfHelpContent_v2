# Backups and restore options for Azure Database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL generally does not support restoring dropped servers. When a server is dropped, the operation cascades to the backups shortly after the server drop operation was initiated.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you accidentally dropped a server, immediately issue a point-in-time restore request using our [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/mysql/servers/create#create-a-database-as-a-point-in-time-restore) to a point in time just before the time the server was dropped. You can issue this request within 7 days of accidentally dropping a server. This may enable you to recover the deleted server.

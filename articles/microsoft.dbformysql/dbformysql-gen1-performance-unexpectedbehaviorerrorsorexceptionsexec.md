# Troubleshoot query execution problems in Azure Database for MySQL Single Server

Query execution issues can be caused by the database engine itself or by the interaction of the database engine and the service.

To resolve query execution issues when working with Azure Database for MySQL Single Server, use the following guidance.

## Recommended Steps

* **Troubleshooting timeouts or the loss of connectivity**

For information about how to resolve timeouts or connectivity issues, see [Troubleshoot issues connecting to Azure Databases for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-common-connection-issues).

* **Troubleshooting slow query performance**

Review your queries for any recent changes that might have caused the unexpected behavior. Also be sure to check the top consumers in terms of database usage. You can use [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-store) and [Slow Query log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-server-logs-in-portal) to identify top consumers, and then [use Explain to profile and optimize your query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-query-performance).

For more information about how to resolve issues with query performance, see [Troubleshoot query performance in Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-query-performance).

* **Troubleshooting high CPU utilization?**

If you're experiencing high utilization on the CPU, remember that the number of active connections to your server can cause a spike. Be sure to review [Connecting efficiently to Azure Database for MySQL with ProxySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/connecting-efficiently-to-azure-database-for-mysql-with-proxysql/ba-p/1279842). For more information about resolving issues related to high CPU usage, see [Azure Database for MySQL Performance Troubleshooting Basics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/azure-database-for-mysql-performance-troubleshooting-basics/ba-p/782815).

* **Troubleshooting out of memory issues?**

If you're experiencing out-of-memory issues, see [Tune your server parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#tune-your-server-parameters) in the article on App development best practices.

* **Troubleshooting out of connections issues?**

If you're experiencing out of connections issues, see [Use connection pooling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#use-connection-pooling) in the article on App development best practices.

* **Azure portal says MySQL version 5.7 or 8.0, but the application is showing 5.6.47.0**
* 
Azure Database for MySQL uses a gateway to redirect connections to server instances. After the connection is established, the MySQL client displays the MySQL version set in the gateway, not the version running on your MySQL server instance. To connect to the gateway that is version MySQL 5.7, use port number 3308 instead of 3306, and to connect through the gateway that is running MySQL version 8.0, connect via port 3309.

  **Connection string examples:**<br>
  * Gateway 5.7: mysql -h servername.mysql.database.azure.com -u username@servername -P 3308 -p
  * Gateway 8.0: mysql -h servername.mysql.database.azure.com -u username@servername -P 3309 -p

### Quick Tips

Make sure to consider the following points:<br>
* Monitor resource consumption on your server. If you max out either I/O or compute resources, scale up the resources that are limited. For more information, see [Monitoring in Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-monitoring).
* Donâ€™t forget to search for potential solutions from the MySQL community.

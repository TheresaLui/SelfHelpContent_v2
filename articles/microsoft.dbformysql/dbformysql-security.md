# Security in Azure Database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL comes with a rich set of security features including server level firewall rules, encryption for data at rest and in flight, VNet service endpoints, and Advanced Threat Protection. Currently not support are engine level auditing capabilities, bring your own key for data encryption at rest, and injecting a server directly into a VNet with dedicated private IP.

# Server is facing slow login issues

<!--issueDescription-->
During our investigation regarding performance issues to your MySQL server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName--> we found that 70% of login setup time is above 1 second between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> (UTC). Slow login issues can have many different root causes.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you are maxing out IO, memory or compute resources, scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, use accelerated networking for lowest connection latency. Please see the recommended documents section. 
* In order to avoid overhead for establishing new connections, consider using a [connection pooler](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-connectivity#access-databases-by-using-connection-pooling-recommended) between your application and MySQL server
* If you are connecting from the Azure Kubernetes Service, review the [Develop with Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-aks) documentation

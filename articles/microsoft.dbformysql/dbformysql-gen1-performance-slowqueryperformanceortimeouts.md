# Troubleshooting query performance in Azure Database for MySQL

Query performance issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps, below, to resolve the most common causes for performance issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Are you using Basic Tier server?**

Basic tier servers are intended for testing, development, and small-scale or infrequently used applications. Therefore, a production workload can max out resources easily. For more information, see [Understanding Performance in Basic Tier for Azure Database MySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-support-blog/understanding-performance-in-basic-tier-for-azure-database/ba-p/369142).

**Do you need to troubleshoot CPU high usage?**

Review [Azure Database for MySQL Performance Troubleshooting Basics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/azure-database-for-mysql-performance-troubleshooting-basics/ba-p/782815).

Did you know that the number of active connection can cause a CPU spike? Make sure that you are [connecting efficiently to Azure Database for MySQL with ProxySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/connecting-efficiently-to-azure-database-for-mysql-with-proxysql/ba-p/1279842).

**Does Azure MySQL seem to be running slower than usual?**

Analyzing your tables frequently pushes better execution plans for your queries. Consider [creating a dashboard for Azure Database for MySQL to monitor CPU, Memory, and number of connections](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/create-a-monitoring-dashboard-for-azure-database-for-mysql/ba-p/1233203).

**Is your database tuned for best application performance?**

Consider [tuning your server parameters for best performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#tune-your-server-parameters).

**Want more advanced performance monitoring?**

See [sys_schema views for performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-sys-schema).

**Is a specific query slow?**
Consider using [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-store) and [Slow Query log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-server-logs-in-portal) to spot slow queries and then [Explain and Optimize your query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-query-performance).
    * Make sure that you have the right set of indexes created for your queries.
    * Make sure that there are no deadlocks in concurrent queries.
    * Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you max out I/O or compute resources, increase or scale up the resource on which you are limited.
    * Only retrieve the columns that you really need instead of using `select \*`.

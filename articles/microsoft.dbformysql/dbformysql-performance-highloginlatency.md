# Troubleshooting login performance in Azure Database for MySQL

Slow login issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps to solve for the most common issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you max out either I/O or compute resources, increase scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, turn on accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* Use connection pooling on the client whenever possible to avoid overhead for establishing new connections
* If you are connecting from the Azure Kubernetes Service, review the [Develop with Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-aks) documentation

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Azure Database for MySQL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/)

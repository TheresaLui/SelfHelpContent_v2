# Replicate data into Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

Data-in Replication allows you to synchronize data from a MySQL server running on-premises, in virtual machines, or database services hosted by other cloud providers into the Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server. Data-in Replication is based on the binary log (binlog) file position-based replication native to MySQL.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure the SSL CA certificate provided for the domain has been included in the "mysql.az_replication_change_master" stored procedure.
* Ensure the machine hosting the master server allows both inbound and outbound traffic on port 3306
* Ensure the the master server has **Public IP address** or the DNS is public accessible

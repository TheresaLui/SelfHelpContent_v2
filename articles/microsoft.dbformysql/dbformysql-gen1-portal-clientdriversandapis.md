# Connecting to Azure Databases for MySQL Single Server

Azure Database for MySQL Single Server uses the community edition of MySQL. As such, most drivers and tools are able to connect to the service. There are some limitations in functionality because Azure Database for MySQL is a fully managed platform as a service.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check the current [supported versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-supported-versions) for the service
* Check the current known [limitations of the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-limits) to see if your scenario is not supported
* Review the list of officially [supported drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-compatibility) to make sure you are using a supported driver version

# Backups and restore options for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server

Azure Database for MySQL Flexible server supports point-in-time restore to any point within the configured backup retention period for a server. The restore operation will create a new server side-by-side with the old server. Additionally, the new serer created is exactly of the same configuration as that of the old server. In-place restores and restoring individual databases within a server are not supported.

The default retention period is 7 days and can be changed from any time between **1 to 35** days. The backups required to support this functionality are taken automatically and users do not have access to the backups. Because transaction log backups are taken every 5 minutes, you may need to wait 5 minutes before you're able to restore to a specific point-in-time within a 5 minute interval. Additionally, you can directly go to the **Latest Restore Point** by using the default point in time restore operation.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you are having connectivity issues after restoring the server, make sure that the connection string is referring to the restored server and you are connecting to the server using the steps detailed here.
* Ensure that you try to restore to a point in time that is within your configured retention period. Note that we do not backfill the backups if you increase the retention period.
* You can restore to the latest possible restored point for the server which is available by default.
* The point in time restore duration depends on your database size and the transaction log size from last full backup. The SLA of restore time is 12 hours.

* Restore servers are always created in the same resource group and same subscription as the existing server. If you want to restore server in a different resource group or different subscription, you can [move the restore server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) after creation.

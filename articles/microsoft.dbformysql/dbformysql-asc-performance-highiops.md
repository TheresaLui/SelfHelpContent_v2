# Server is facing high IOPS consumption

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your performance issues with your MySQL server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that your IOPS consumption was above <!--$IOPercentageThreshold-->IOPercentageThreshold<!--/$IOPercentageThreshold-->% in <!--$Count-->Count<!--/$Count--> instance(s). The longest durations (UTC) of high IOPS consumption were at: <!--$Periods-->Periods<!--/$Periods-->.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Consider increasing [IOPS limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-pricing-tiers#storage) by scaling storage size. You can increase the storage in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) by clicking on the "Pricing Tier" and then scale up the storage as per your requirement.

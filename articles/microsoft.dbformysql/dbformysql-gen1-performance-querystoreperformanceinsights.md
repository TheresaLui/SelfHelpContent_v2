# Troubleshooting query performance in Azure Database for MySQL Single Server

Query performance issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps to solve for the most common causes for performance issues.

**Troubleshooting slow query performance?**
Review your queries for any recent changes that might have caused the unexpected behavior. Also be sure to check the top consumers in terms of database utilization. You can use [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-store) and [Slow Query log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-server-logs-in-portal) to identify top consumers, and then [use Explain to profile and optimize your query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-query-performance).
For more information about how to resolve issues with query performance, see [Troubleshoot query performance in Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-query-performance).

**Troubleshooting high CPU utilization?**
If you are experiencing high utilization on the CPU, remember that the number of active connections to your server can cause a spike. Be sure to review [Connecting efficiently to Azure Database for MySQL with ProxySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/connecting-efficiently-to-azure-database-for-mysql-with-proxysql/ba-p/1279842). For more information about resolving issues related to high CPU utilization, see [Azure Database for MySQL Performance Troubleshooting Basics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/azure-database-for-mysql-performance-troubleshooting-basics/ba-p/782815)

**Troubleshooting out of memory issues?**
If you are experiencing out of memory issues, see [Tune your server parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#tune-your-server-parameters) in the article on App development best practices.

**Troubleshooting out of connections issues?**
If you are experiencing out of connections issues, see [Use connection pooling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#use-connection-pooling) in the article on App development best practices.

**Is your database tuned for best application performance?** Consider [tuning your server parameters for best performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/app-development-best-practices#tune-your-server-parameters).

**Use our intelligent performance features for additional insights:**

  1. [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-store)
  2. [Query Performance Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-performance-insight)
  3. [Performance Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-performance-recommendations)

* If you want to use Query Store, ensure that **default_transaction_read_only** is not set to ON. Assure you have the right set of indexes created for your queries.
* Make sure that the [limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-query-store#limitations-and-known-issues) are not hit

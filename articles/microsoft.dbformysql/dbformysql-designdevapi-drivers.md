# Connecting to Azure Databases for MySQL

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check the current known [limitations of the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-limits) to see if your scenario is not supported
* Review the list of officially [support drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-compatibility) to make sure you are using a supported driver version

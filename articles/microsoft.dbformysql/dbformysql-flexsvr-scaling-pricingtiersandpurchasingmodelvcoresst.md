# Compute tiers and purchasing model in Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server

Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server resources are managed through compute and storage configurations. Refer to the [compute and storage documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-compute-storage) to learn more.

*Compute*

Flexible servers can be created in the following compute tiers:

* **Burstable** compute tier is designed for that donâ€™t need the full CPU continuously (1-2 vCores)
 * **General Purpose** compute tier is for most business workloads requiring balanced compute and memory with scalable I/O throughput (2-64 vCores)
 * **Memory Optimized** compute tier is for high performance database workloads requiring in-memory performance for faster transaction processing and higher concurrency (2-64 vCores)

*Storage*

* All compute tiers support up to 16 TB

*IOPS*

 * The minimum effective IOPS is 100 across all compute tiers & sizes
 * The max effective IOPS is determined by both compute and storage configurations

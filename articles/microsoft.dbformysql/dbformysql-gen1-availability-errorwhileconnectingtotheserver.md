# Connection issues to Azure Databases for MySQL

* **Is the connection failure intermittent?**<br> 
See [Troubleshoot transient errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-common-connection-issues#troubleshoot-transient-errors)

* **Azure Database for MySQL server has gone away?**<br> 
See [MySQL has gone away troubleshooting guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-support-blog/azure-database-for-mysql-server-has-gone-away/ba-p/369138)

* **Can connect from a device, but can't connect from another device**<br>
This happens due to a client-side firewall that's blocking outbound connections or a private network that is not allowed to connect to the Azure Database for MySQL. Install [psping](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/psping) on your client machine to verify connectivity to Azure Database for MySQL. Also try connecting from a public network.

* **Access denied for user "user'@'IP_Address" (using password: YES)**<br> 
See [Error 1045 troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-common-errors#error-1045-28000-access-denied-for-user-usernameip-address-using-password-yes)

* **Client with IP address 'XXX.XX.XXX.X' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server**<br> 
Make sure the IP address is allowed on the [server Firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-manage-firewall-using-portal) and that you are using correct the username format, *your_user@servername*, and the right password.

* **ERROR 2013: Lost connection to MySQL server during query**<br>
This is a common error for MySQL databases. Try to increase the value of the following parameters to solve this issue: `Max_allowed_packet`, `Connect_timeout`, `net_write_timeout`, `net_read_timeout`, `wait_timeout`. Maxing out resource usage can result in this error, as well. Check [Azure Database for MySQL Performance Troubleshooting Basics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/azure-database-for-mysql-performance-troubleshooting-basics/ba-p/782815).

* **The last packet sent successfully to the server was X milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server**.<br>
Consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before using it in your application. To avoid this issue, increase the server configured values for client timeouts, or use the Connector/J connection property `autoReconnect=true` to avoid this problem.

* **Change username format from your_user@servername or port 3306**<br> 
Note that this is the only accepted format to connect to Azure Database for MySQL single server and changing the username format is not possible. Also, port 3306 is the only allowed port and changing it is not possible.

* **Can't connect using SSMS**<br>
Consider using MySQL Workbench or `mysql` native client to connect to Azure Database for MySQL. SSMS is compatible only with Azure SQL Database and can't connect to Azure Database for MySQL.

* **Timeout or dropped connection**<br>
Reaching resource limits in terms of CPU, memory, number of allowed connections, or IOPS is the main reason for timeouts. See [Azure Database for MySQL Performance Troubleshooting Basics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/azure-database-for-mysql-performance-troubleshooting-basics/ba-p/782815).

* **Database is in read only mode**<br>
Servers with less than or equal to 100 GB provisioned storage are marked read-only if the free storage is less than 5% of the provisioned storage size. See [Reaching the storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-pricing-tiers#reaching-the-storage-limit).

* **SSL issues**<br>
See [Configure SSL connectivity in your application to securely connect to Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-ssl).

* **VNET Issues**<br>
See [Create and manage Azure Database for MySQL VNet service endpoints and VNet rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-manage-vnet-using-portal).

* **Is the connection failure persistent?**<br>
See [Troubleshoot persistent errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-troubleshoot-common-connection-issues#troubleshoot-persistent-errors)

Possible causes: Incorrect firewall configuration, an incorrect connection string, an incorrect VNet configuration, missing permissions for the user who is trying to connect, and other possible causes. Work through the following recommended steps to ensure that you aren't encountering a misconfiguration problem. See [Set up alerts when your Azure Database for MySQL server is not accessible](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/get-alerted-when-your-azure-database-for-mysql-server-is-not/ba-p/1996368).

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Intermittent connection errors**

Causes of intermittent connection issues include server restart, high resource usage on the server, and client timeouts. The following steps can help you resolve the issue:

* Retry the connection
* Check your server metrics to see if any resource is near 100% usage. High usage can lead to unavailable resources for a new connection.
* Check your client's timeout settings
* If the issue persists, see more details about persistent connection errors in the following section

### **Persistent connection errors**

**Note: We are working on changing out gateway certificate used to [connect to the server using SSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-ssl-connection-security#ssl-default-settings). See [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-certificate-rotation) to understand the impact and to take steps to avoid connectivity issues.**

If connection issues last for more than several minutes, the root cause may be a more persistent issue. Persistent connection issues when connecting to Azure Databases for MySQL can occur due to an incorrect firewall configuration, an incorrect connection string, an incorrect virtual network (VNet) configuration, missing permissions for the user who is trying to connect, and other reasons. Work through the recommended steps to ensure that you're not encountering a misconfiguration issue.

* Set up firewall rules to be able to connect from your client machine. See how to configure a firewall on [Single Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-firewall-rules) and [Flexible Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl) to allow your client's IP address.
* If you are using Virtual network, ensure that the service endpoints are correctly configured:

	* [How to enable VNET  for Single Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-manage-vnet-using-portal)
	* [How to enable VNET  for Flexible Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-manage-virtual-network-portal)

* If using Single Server, make sure that the user name is in the format `username@servername` in the connection string. If you are using Flexible Server, make sure that the user name in the connection string does not include `@servername`.
* If you are using a non-admin user for your database, make sure the user has the right permissions. See [how to create non-admin users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-create-users).
* Check if SSL is enabled and update your application to use SSL. Check the documentation for the application type that you're using on how to enable SSL.
* Make sure you are using the correct TLS configuration for [Single Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-tls-configurations) and [Flexible Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl)

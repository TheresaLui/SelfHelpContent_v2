# CNAME cleanup

<!--issueDescription-->

We have checked the cluster and it seems that a previously failed deletion attempt may have missed cleaning up the ***{ClusterDnsName}*** CNAME record<br>
<br>
To resolve the issue:<br>
<br>
1. We will help you delete the resource  <br>
2. We will inform you after we delete the resource to try again<br>

# Subnet full

<!--issueDescription-->

We have checked the cluster and it seems that cluster creation failure is due to full subnet if no leaky NICs

To resolve the issue:

1. Check if your subnet has unused resources, remove the unused resource and recreate the cluster  
2. If your subnet was small, increase the subnet range and recreate the cluster

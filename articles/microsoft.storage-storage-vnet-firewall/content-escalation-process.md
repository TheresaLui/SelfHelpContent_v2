# Escalation process

Review and **choose the appropriate escalation method** based on the analysis, severity and urgency of your issue.

## A) Service/Application Escalation

**Follow this process if**, based on the analysis, there is: 

1. Unexpected behavior from the Service/Application which is trying to integrate to Azure Storage 
2. Additional solutions/workarounds are needed to integrate the Service/Application with Azure Storage

Escalation guidelines:

1. Engage Support team responsible of the involved Service or Application(Example: Web App team).
2. The appropriate support team shall create an escalation with their Application/Service Product Group(PG).

## B) Storage Escalation

**Follow this process if**, based on the analysis, there is an unexpected behavior of the Azure Storage Firewall.

# Backups are failing or are slow 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Make sure that the appliance is on the latest software version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-virtual-array-install-update-11)<br>
2. [Ensure that the maximum number of files per share for a file server and maximum number of files per volume for an iSCSI server are as per the recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-ova-limits)<br>
3. [If the backups are failing within a minute of their start time, try moving the backup schedule to a different time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-virtual-array-backup#change-the-backup-start-time)

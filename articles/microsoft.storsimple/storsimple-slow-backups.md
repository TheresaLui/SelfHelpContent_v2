# Backups are running slow

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Run network diagnostics to check if any of the ports are blocked on the firewall, and if so, unblock them](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-diagnostics#to-run-the-diagnostics-tool)<br>
2. [Ensure that your StorSimple device has a dedicated 40 Mbps or more bandwidth available at all times](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-system-requirements#networking-best-practices)

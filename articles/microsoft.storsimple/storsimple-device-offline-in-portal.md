# Device status offline in portal 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Check if there are any ongoing Azure Portal outages in your region](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/)  
2. [Run network diagnostics to check if any of the ports are blocked on the firewall, and if so, unblock them](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-diagnostics)
3. [Review network requirements for StorSimple to check if the required ports are open and URLs are whitelisted on the firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-system-requirements)
4. [Ensure that the new authentication URL is whitelisted on the firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-aad-registration-key#url-changes-for-aad-authentication)
5. [Make sure that the device is on the latest version and new authentication changes are made](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-aad-registration-key#device-version-and-authentication-changes)

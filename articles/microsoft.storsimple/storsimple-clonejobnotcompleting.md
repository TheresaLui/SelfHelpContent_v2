# My clone job is not completing.
If your clone job is not completing, your device may not be configured properly.

## **Recommended steps**
* In the local web UI of the virtual array, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Validate that the device is properly configured and resolve any reported issues. <br>
<br>
*NOTE*: We recommend that you stop writing to the target volume or share to speed up the clone process.

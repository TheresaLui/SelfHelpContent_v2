# Unable to register the device 

## **Recommended Steps**

If the `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard` command is failing while validating DNS with message *Could not validate the DNS server. Ensure you have entered a valid DNS server, the server is reachable and UDP 53 is open for outbound communication* and you have already validated the DNS IP address as communicated in the message and are still facing the same issue, please bypass validation by using the command `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard -BypassValidation 1` to successfully run the setup wizard.

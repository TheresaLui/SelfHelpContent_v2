# I want to move my StorSimple Device Manager from classic portal

If you are on the Azure classic portal and want to move your StorSimple Device Manager to the new Azure portal, perform the following steps to transition to the new Azure portal.

## **Recommended steps**

1. Go to [the new Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) and select the StorSimple Device Manager.
2. Once you select the StorSimple Device Manager, a blade is displayed. Click Migrate at the bottom of this blade.
3. When prompted for confirmation, review the impact of this transition and then click Migrate.

The option to migrate to the Azure portal is available in phases. If you do not see an option to migrate to Azure portal but you want to move and have reviewed the impact of migration as documented in the [Considerations for transition](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storsimple/storsimple-8000-manage-service#considerations-for-transition), you can [submit a request](https://aka.ms/ss8000-cx-signup).

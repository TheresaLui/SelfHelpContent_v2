# I'm having problems finding my managed applications

We recommend checking out the [managed applications center](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Appliance/ManagedAppsHubBlade/overview). It allows you to view all of your managed application instances from either the Azure Marketplace or Azure Service Catalog, learn how to create new managed applications, and service them. <br>

# I'm having a problem with something else in the Azure Portal

For problems such as using tags, ARM Templates, dashboards loading or refreshing, support tickets, & portal performance, please return to "Basics" at the top of this page and select "Portal" as your Service for your issue. <br>

# I'm having problems deploying something from the Azure Marketplace

The Azure Marketplace is a separate Azure service than the Azure Service Catalog. We recommend posting a question on the MSDN forum under Azure Marketplace for support with the Azure Marketplace. [Azure Marketplace MSDN Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=DataMarket) <br>

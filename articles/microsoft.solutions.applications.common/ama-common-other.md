# What is Azure Service Catalog?

Azure Service Catalog allows organizations to create a catalog of approved solutions for use in the Azure environment. Service Catalog Definitions allow an organization to define new Azure Managed Applications via an Azure Resource Manager template for deploying resources and a CreateUIDefinition for a create experience tailored for the deployment of the resources. These definitions can then be deployed as a managed application that is locked so that only a specific group or identity within the Azure Subscription can manage the resources. <br>

**I'm having a problem with something else in the Azure Portal**

For problems such as using tags, ARM Templates, dashboards loading or refreshing, support tickets, & portal performance, please return to "Basics" at the top of this page and select "Portal" as your Service for your issue. <br>

**I'm having problems deploying something from the Azure Marketplace**

The Azure Marketplace is a separate Azure service than the Azure Service Catalog. We recommend posting a question on the MSDN forum under Azure Marketplace for support with the Azure Marketplace. [Azure Marketplace MSDN Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/home?forum=DataMarket) <br>

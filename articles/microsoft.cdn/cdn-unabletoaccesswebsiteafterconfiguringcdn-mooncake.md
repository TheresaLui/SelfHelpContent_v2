# Unable to access website after configuring CDN

## **Recommended steps**
1. Please try to access for a few more times. If the issue still exists, then network impact should be excluded.

2. Make sure domain name configurations are normal. Please verify configurations of origin domain of the custom domain and return-to-source host, as well as domain name configurations (to avoid accessibility issues due to the custom domain still being configured).

3. If the issue can be reproduced even though the custom domain is configured properly, please [contact support](https://www.azure.cn/support/contact/) and provide the URL and edge node IP for troubleshooting.

## **Recommended steps**
1. Check if there is local cache. Please check if the file has local cache through F12 shortcut function of your browser to avoid test results is affected by local cache.

2. Check if cache refresh operation is successfully completed. A cache refresh request usually takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete, and it would take longer time for larger or more files.

3. If there is no local cache and the cache refresh request is completed, please [contact support](https://www.azure.cn/support/contact/) for help.

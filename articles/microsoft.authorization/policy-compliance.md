# Azure Policy - Compliance Reports

## **Recommended Steps**

* **How do I view the ‘last evaluated’ timestamp?**

Click an assignment under **Compliance**. The "last evaluated" timestamp is viewable as the last column of "Resource Compliance" tab. For an initiative assignment, you will need to drill-down to a single policy to view the timestamp, as the evaluation timestamp is at per-policy, per-resource granularity.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Get compliance data programmatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/getting-compliance-data#command-line)

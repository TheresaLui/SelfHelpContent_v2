# Azure Policy - Compliance Reports

## **Recommended steps**

**How do I view the ‘last evaluated’ timestamp?**
Click onto an assignment under Compliance. The ‘last evaluated’ timestamp is viewable as the last column of ‘Resource Compliance’ tab. For an initiative assignment, you will need to drill-down to a single policy to view the timestamp, because the evaluation timestamp is at per policy per resource granularity.

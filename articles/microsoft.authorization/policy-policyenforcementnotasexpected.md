# Azure Policy - Policy enforcement not as expected

Use the following steps if Azure Policy policy enforcement is not as expected.

## **Recommended Steps**

1.  Allow approximately 30 minutes for policy effect and compliance data to propagate. 
2.  Verify that the correct [policy definition mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#mode) is being used:
  * Mode all for all resource types 
  * Mode indexed if the policy checks using tags or location
  * Mode that has .Data is not available for any custom policies. Built-in definitions only.
3. Verify that the effect is correct. If you're using `AuditIfNotExisit` or `DeployIfNotExist`, an existence condition is needed. If you want to monitor with no effect or existence condition, then use Audit. Modify doesnâ€™t require either an ARM template or existence condition. Learn more about [effects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects).
4. If adding a tag condition in your policy definition, follow similar logic as [these tag built-in policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/samples/pattern-tags) 
5.  Verify that the resource payload matches the policy definition logic. You can do this check by capturing a [HAR trace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/capture-browser-trace) or reviewing the ARM template properties. 
6.  If you duplicated a built-in policy definition to customize the definition _or_ you're authoring a custom definition, create the support ticket under **Authoring a policy** for information and help that fits your needs.

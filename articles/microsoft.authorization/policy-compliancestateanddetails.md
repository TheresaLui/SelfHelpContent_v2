# Azure Policy - Compliance state and details

## **Recommended Steps**

* **How do I view ‘Last evaluated’ timestamp?**

Click an assignment under **Compliance**. The "last evaluated" timestamp is viewable as the last column of "Resource Compliance" tab. For an initiative assignment, you will need to drill-down to a single policy to view the timestamp, as the evaluation timestamp is at per-policy, per-resource granularity.

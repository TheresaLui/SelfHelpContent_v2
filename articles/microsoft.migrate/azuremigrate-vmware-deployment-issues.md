# Deployment issues with Azure Migrate appliance for VMWare

## **Recommended Steps**

### Issues with the prerequisites check on appliance

**I am getting an error in the Internet prerequisite check on the appliance**

The appliance should have Internet connectivity (either directly or via a proxy). Ensure you are able to connect to the URLs listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#assessment-url-access-requirements). If whitelisting is required, please ensure you whitelist all the URLs.

### Issues in registering the appliance with Azure Migrate:

**I am unable to register the appliance to Azure Migrate due to insufficient permissions on the subscription** 

Ensure that the Azure user account used to register the appliance has at least the Contributor role on the subscription. You can check for the required Azure roles and permissions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-prepare-vmware#prepare-azure).

**I am unable to see the list of customer subscriptions in the Subscriptions drop-down, when logged in using my CSP credentials on the appliance**

Currently, listing of the customer subscriptions managed by a CSP partner is not supported. To register the appliance with an Azure Migrate project in a customer subscription, you need to log in with Azure user account from the customer's tenant to see their subscription(s) in the drop-down.

### Issues in adding vCenter Server

**I am unable to connect to vCenter Server due to incorrect credentials or insufficient permissions**

Verify the credentials provided for vCenter Server. Youâ€™ll need a read-only account to access the vCenter Server managing the VMs you want to discover.

**I am unable to add multiple vCenter servers on the appliance configuration manager**

Currently, addition of multiple vCenter servers to a single appliance is not supported. There is a one-to-one relation between appliance and a vCenter server. To discover multiple vCenter servers, you'll need to deploy multiple appliances. You can register multiple appliances to the same Azure Migrate project. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/scale-vmware-assessment#planning-limits) on how you can discover multiple vCenter servers.

**I am unable to change the vCenter server details after starting the discovery using the appliance**

After starting the discovery using the appliance, you cannot change the vCenter server details. To discover another vCenter server, you'll need to deploy a new appliance.

### Issues after hitting 'Save and start discovery'

**I am unable to initiate discovery due to insufficient AAD privileges**

Ensure that you have the required [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-prepare-vmware#prepare-azure) to create and manage AAD Applications in Azure. You should have "Application Developer" role or user role with "User can register applications" allowed at the tenant level.

**I am unable to initiate discovery due to errors related to AAD Application operation failure**

This error is encountered when the Azure user account used to initiate the discovery is different from the account used to register the appliance. You can do one of the following:

1. Ensure that the user account initiating the discovery is same as the one used to register the appliance
2. Provide AAD Application access permissions to the other user account for which the discovery operation is failing
3. Delete the Resource Group previously created for Azure Migrate project and create another Resource Group to start again

**I am getting errors related to discovery operation failure due to conflict in creation of some Migrate artifacts**

This error indicates a previous discovery operation is still ongoing. Please wait for some time and review the list of machines discovered on Azure portal. If you see the machines are still not discovered, start discovery again on the appliance.

# Resource move to another subscription

## **Recommended steps**

### **Guidance for support ticket creation**

Azure Migrate helps you migrate on-premises resources to Azure. For issues or queries regarding resource move to another subscription, please go back to the previous tab, 'Basics' and select the service for the resource that you are planning to move. For example, if you are planning to move a virtual network from one subscription to another, please select 'Virtual Network' as the service. For VM move, please select 'Virtual machines for Windows' and so on.

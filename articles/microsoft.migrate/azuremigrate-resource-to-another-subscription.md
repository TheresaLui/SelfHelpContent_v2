# Resource move to another subscription

## **Recommended steps**

Currently none of the Azure Migrate resources can be moved, details are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources#microsoftmigrate)


### **For faster resolution please raise this issue in related service**

Please go back to the previous tab, 'Basics' and select the service for the resource that you are planning to move. 

For example, if you are planning to move a virtual network from one subscription to another, please select 'Virtual Network' as the service. For VM move, please select 'Virtual machines for Windows' and so on.

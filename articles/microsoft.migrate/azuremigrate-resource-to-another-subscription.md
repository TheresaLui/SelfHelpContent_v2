# Resource move to another subscription

## **Recommended steps**

Currently none of the Azure Migrate resources can be moved. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources#microsoftmigrate).

Azure Resource Mover can help you move Azure resources between Azure regions. [Learn more](button-link:https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-mover/overview).

### **For faster resolution please raise this issue in related service**

Go back to the **Basics** tab, and select the service for the resource you're planning to move. 

For example, if you are planning to move a virtual network from one subscription to another, select **Virtual Network** as the service. For VM move, select **Virtual machines for Windows**, and so on.

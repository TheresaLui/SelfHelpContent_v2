# Azure Migrate Service 

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Migrate resources from one subscription to other subscription**

	Use the corresponding service for the resource being migrated. For example, to migrate Azure VMs (Windows) from one subscription to another subscription, use 'Virtual Machine running Windows" service.

* **Migrate Managed disk to different subscription**

	Use 'Storage Account Management' service.

### Guidance for support ticket creation

Azure Migrate helps you migrate on-premises resources to Azure. <br>
For issues or queries regarding ASM to ARM migration, go to the previous **Basics** tab, and select the service for the resource that you are planning to migrate. For example, if you plan to migrate a virtual machine from ASM to ARM, select **Virtual machines for Windows** as the service.

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**What does this migration plan mean for my existing tooling?**<br>
Updating your tooling to the Resource Manager deployment model is one of the most important changes that you have to account for in your migration plans.<br>

**How long will the management-plane downtime be?**<br>
It depends on the number of resources that are being migrated. For smaller deployments (a few tens of VMs), the whole migration should take less than an hour. For large-scale deployments (hundreds of VMs), the migration can take a few hours.<br>

**Can I roll back after my migrating resources are committed in Resource Manager?**<br>
You can quit your migration as long as the resources are in the prepared state. Rollback is not supported after the resources have been successfully migrated through the commit operation.<br>

**Can I roll back my migration if the commit operation fails?**<br>
You cannot abort migration if the commit operation fails. All migration operations, including the commit operation, are idempotent. We recommend that you retry the operation after a short time. If you still face an error, create a support ticket or create a forum post with the **ClassicIaaSMigration** tag on our VM forum.<br>

**What happens if I run into a quota error while preparing the IaaS resources for migration?**<br>
We recommend that you abort your migration and log a support request to increase the quotas in the region where you are migrating the VMs. After the quota request is approved, you can start executing the migration steps again.<br>

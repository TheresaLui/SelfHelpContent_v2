# Discovery issues with import

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I want to add more than 2 disks, but I see columns for only 2 disks in the template.**

Disk details can be added for up to 8 disks. You can add details for more disks by adding columns in the template. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-assess-import#add-multiple-disks) about how you can add more than 2 disks in the CSV.

### **How can I delete the imported servers?**

Currently, deleting servers is not feasible. You can overwrite a server by importing another entry with the same server name.

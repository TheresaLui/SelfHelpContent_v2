# Exporting assessment as an excel report

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I am unable to export the assessment report**
If you are unable to export the assessment report from the portal, try using the REST API to get a download URL for the assessment report as mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/troubleshooting-general#i-am-unable-to-export-the-assessment-report).

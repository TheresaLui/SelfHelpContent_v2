# Dependency visualization in Azure Migrate

## **Recommended steps**

### **How can I automate installation of Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and dependency agent?**
You can use [script for dependency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-service-map-configure#installation-script-examples) and [script for MMA](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Install-OMS-Agent-with-2c9c99ab). In addition to scripts, you can also leverage deployment tools like System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), [Intigua](https://www.intigua.com/getting-started-intigua-for-azure-migration) etc., to deploy the agents.

### **Can I export the dependency visualization report?**
No, currently you cannot export the dependency visualization report. 

### **Can I visualize dependencies for more than one hour duration?**
No, Azure Migrate lets you visualize dependencies for up to one  hour duration. You can go back to a particular date in the last one month, but the duration for which you can visualize the dependencies is up to 1 hour.

### **Is dependency visualization supported for groups with more than 10 VMs?**
You can visualize dependencies of groups with up to 10 VMs, if you have a group with more than 10 VMs, we recommend you to split the group in to smaller groups and visualize dependencies.

### **I installed agents in my on-prem VMs, but the dependencies are not showing up.**
Typically, the dependencies start showing up after 15-20 minutes of installing the agents. Learn more about [agent installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-create-group-machine-dependencies#download-and-install-the-vm-agents). 

### **What is the supported OS matrix for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and dependency agent?**
Refer to the support matrix document [MMA agent] and [dependency agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-service-map-configure#supported-windows-operating-systems) for details.

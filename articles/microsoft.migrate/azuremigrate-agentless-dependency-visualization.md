# Agentless Dependency Visualization

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I want access to use the Agentless dependency analysis feature. How do I do that?**

Agentless dependency analysis is available in a limited preview currently. Please subscribe at [Agentless Dependency Analysis](https://aka.ms/appmapping) to get access.

### **My subscription is whitelisted but I still don't see the Add/Remove server tab to enable the dependency.How do I proceed?**

Please ensure that you use the URL provided in the email. Agentless dependency is still in private preview, and the feature is not accessible using the standard "portal.azure.com" URL.

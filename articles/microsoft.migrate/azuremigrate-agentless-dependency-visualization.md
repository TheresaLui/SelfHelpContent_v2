# Agentless dependency analysis

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I want access to use the Agentless dependency analysis feature. How do I do that?**

Agentless dependency analysis is available in a limited preview currently. Please submit a request at [this link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR35qjpJOBF1MmO4OLvbG-VVUM1UzOVAzVTY2MlM1NE5WMlJXSUhCTkRMOC4u) for access to the preview. New invitations are currently on hold and will resume in March.

### **My subscription is whitelisted but I still don't see the Add/Remove server tab to enable the dependency. How do I proceed?**

Please ensure that you use the URL provided in the email. Agentless dependency is still in private preview, and the feature is not accessible using the standard "portal.azure.com" URL.

### **I see a dependency map with 0 processes**

Ensure the [necessary prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#agentless-dependency-visualization) are met for agentless dependency analysis.

### **What are the privileges required to set up agentless dependency analysis**

Review the necessary prerequisites for agentless dependency analysis [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#agentless-dependency-visualization).

### **Have I been enabled for the preview?**

If you are enabled, you would have received an invitation via email. The preview is currently fully subscribed and new invitations will be rolled out in March.

# Agentless dependency analysis

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I want access to use the Agentless dependency analysis feature. How do I do that?**

Agentless dependency analysis is available in a limited preview currently, and only for VMware VMs. Please submit a request at [this link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR35qjpJOBF1MmO4OLvbG-VVUM1UzOVAzVTY2MlM1NE5WMlJXSUhCTkRMOC4u) for access to the preview. Note you can access the preview only when you receive an invitation email. 

### ** I have not received an email invitation even after submitting the request for the preview. **
Expect a delay of 2-4 weeks to get the invitation email. If you require urgent access, send an email to hamusa@microsoft.com requesting access, providing information on the business urgency.

### **My subscription is whitelisted but I still don't see the Add/Remove server tab to enable the dependency. How do I proceed?**

You are not enabled for the preview until you get an email invitation from the product group. If you have received the email invitation, please ensure that you use the URL provided in the email. Agentless dependency is still in private preview, and the feature is not accessible using the standard "portal.azure.com" URL.

### **I see a dependency map with 0 processes**

Ensure the [necessary prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#agentless-dependency-visualization) are met for agentless dependency analysis.

### **What are the privileges required to set up agentless dependency analysis**

Review the necessary prerequisites for agentless dependency analysis [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#agentless-dependency-visualization).

### **Have I been enabled for the preview?**

If you are enabled, you would have received an invitation via email.

# Configure Caching

Azure Front Door Service can deliver large files without a cap on file size using a technique called "object chunking". When a large file is requested, Front Door retrieves smaller pieces of the file from the backend. After receiving a full or byte-range file request, a Front Door environment requests the file from the backend in chunks of 8 MB. The recommended documents listed below will provide instructions on configuring caching for your Front Door service.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Caching with Azure Front Door Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-caching)
* [How to create a Front Door with caching enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/201-front-door-create-caching/) for a defined routing configuration that will cache static assets for your work

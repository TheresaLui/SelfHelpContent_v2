# Failover Performance

* All Front Door configurations include monitoring of backend health and automated instant global failover. This data is available through Azure Monitor and allows you to track the failover performance of your Azure Front Door resources.

## **Recommended documents**
 * Front Door provides a range of [Traffic-routing methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-routing-methods) and [Backend health monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-health-probes) options to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Similar to [Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview), Front Door is resilient to failures, including the failure of an entire Azure region.

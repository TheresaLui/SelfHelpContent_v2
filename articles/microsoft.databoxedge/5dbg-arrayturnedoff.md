# Data Box Gateway has turned off

## **Recommended Steps**

This could be due to one of the following:

1. The host on which the Data Box Gateway is provisioned has run out of disk space. If running Hyper-V, create additional space by doing the following:

    1. Launch Hyper-V Manager
    2. Go to **Tools** > **Server Manager** > **Hyper-V Manager**
    3. From the **Virtual Machines** list, identify the Data Box Gateway in a  `Paused-Critical` state
    4. Free up resources so that the Data Box Gateway can be booted (i.e. free up disk space on corresponding hard drives)
    4. Right-click each Data Box Gateway, then click **Resume** to return the virtual machine to a running state

2. If the Data Box Gateway has not run out of disk space, ensure that it is running

# Data Box Gateway has turned off

## **Recommended steps**

This could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The host on which the Data Box Gateway is provisioned has run out of disk space. If running Hyper-V, create additional space by doing the following:

    1. Launch Hyper-V Manager. Go to **Tools** > **Server Manager** > **Hyper-V Manager**.
    2. From the **Virtual Machines** list, identify the Data Box Gateway in a  `Paused-Critical` state.
    3. Free up resources so that the Data Box Gateway can be booted. For example, you can free up the disk space on corresponding hard drives.
    4. Right-click each Data Box Gateway, then click **Resume**. This returns the virtual machine to a running state.

2. If the Data Box Gateway has not run out of disk space, then try to turn it on.

# My device appears offline in the portal

## **Recommended Steps**

If your device is offline, it could be due to one of the following:

* Your device time may be out of sync with the Internet time. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve any reported issues.
* The device is turned off. Turn on your device! For more information, go to [Turn on your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode).
* Your proxy server settings may be incorrect. Ensure that you use a valid proxy server while registering. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-deploy-connect-setup-activate#set-up-and-activate-the-physical-device).

# My device appears offline in the portal

## **Recommended Steps**

If your device is offline, it could be due to one of the following:

1. The device is not able to communicate with the Azure service. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve any reported issues.
2. The device may be turned off or paused on the hypervisor:

    * Your device could have rebooted due to a Windows update. Wait a few minutes and try to reconnect.
    * In Hyper-V, your device will be paused automatically when the volume that stores snapshots or virtual hard disks runs out of available storage. The state of the device is listed as *paused-critical* in Hyper-V Manager. Resolve this by creating additional space on the volume.
    * If you still cannot connect, check the Hyper-V host or ESX server to ensure that the VM is healthy.

3. Your proxy server settings may be incorrect. Ensure that you use a valid proxy server while registering. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](https://aka.ms/dbe-device-local-mgmt).

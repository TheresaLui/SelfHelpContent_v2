# My device appears offline in the portal

## **Recommended steps**

If your device is offline, this could be due to one of the following reasons:

* Your device time may be out of sync with the Internet time. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve the reported issues.
* The device is turned off. Turn on your device! For more information, go to [Turn on your device](https://aka.ms/dbe-device-local-mgmt)
* Your proxy server settings may be incorrect. Ensure that you use a valid proxy server while registering. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](https://aka.ms/dbe-device-local-mgmt).

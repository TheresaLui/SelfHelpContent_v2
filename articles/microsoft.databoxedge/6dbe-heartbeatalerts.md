# I am getting heartbeat alert emails

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are receiving heartbeat alerts, this may be because your device has Internet connectivity issues. Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

* The Internet connectivity is broken. Check your internet connection. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve any reported issues.
* The device is turned off. Turn on your device! For more information, go to [Turn on your device](https://aka.ms/dbe-device-local-mgmt).
* Your device could have rebooted due to an update. Wait for a few minutes, then try to reconnect.

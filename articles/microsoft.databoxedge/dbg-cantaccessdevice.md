# I can’t access my device in File Explorer

## **Recommended Steps**

If you can't access your device in File Explorer, try the following:

1. In the Azure portal, check if your device shows offline
2. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve any reported issues.
3. If you are accessing your device via the IP, check if you have used DHCP instead of a static IP. Your IP may have changed.
4. Check the Hyper-V or ESX host for your VM to make sure that the VM is turned on and running

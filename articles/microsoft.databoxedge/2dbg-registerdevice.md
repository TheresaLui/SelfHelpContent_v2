# I can't activate my device

## **Recommended Steps**

If your activation fails, this may be due to one of the following reasons:

* Your activation key may be incorrect. Verify that you are using the appropriate activation key for the respective solutions. A Data Box Edge device only works with an activation key corresponding to a Data Box Edge resource. The same is true for Data Box Gateway. To get the activation key, go to **Overview** for your Data Box Edge resource in the Azure portal
* Your device time may be out of sync. In the local web UI of the device, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests** and click **Run diagnostic tests**. Resolve any reported issues.
* Your proxy server settings may be incorrect. Ensure that you use a valid proxy server while registering. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode#manage-power).
* Ensure that firewall is configured to meet the [Networking requirements for your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-system-requirements#networking-port-requirements).

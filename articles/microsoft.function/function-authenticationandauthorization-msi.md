# authentication and authorization/Managed Service Identity (MSI) Integration 

Managed Service Identities is a feature that gives an Azure resource an identity in Azure AD. Once the identity is created, you can assign the identity to a RBAC. This is different than authenticating an incoming request to the Azure resource where MSI is enabled.

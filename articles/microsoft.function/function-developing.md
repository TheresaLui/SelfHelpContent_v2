# Developing Functions

Azure Functions allows you the flexibility to write your Function in several languages. The supported languages for the 1.x version of the runtime are:

* C#
* F#
* JavaScript

Azure Fuctions also adds support for [Java and Python](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-functions-gets-better-for-python-and-javascript-developers/). <br> 

The 1.x runtime also supports several experimental languages:

* Python
* PHP
* TypeScript
* Batch (.cmd, .bat)
* Bash
* PowerShell

If you’re using one of these experimental languages, then a support case should not be opened. Microsoft recommends that you follow these steps:

1)	Check if this issue was raised in the [forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=azurefunctions)
2)	Check if the issue was raised on Stack Overflow
3)	Check if the issue was raised on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host)
4)	If there isn’t any matching discussions, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host)

For more on language support in Azure Functions, please visit this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages). <br>

The [Azure Serverless Community Library](https://serverlesslibrary.net/) has samples on common use cases for Azure Functions that are ready to deploy.

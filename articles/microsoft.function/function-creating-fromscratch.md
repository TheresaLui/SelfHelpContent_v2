# Creating functions from scratch

Azure Functions allows you the flexibility to write your Function in several languages. The supported languages for the 1.x version of the runtime are as follows. <br>
* C#
* F#
* JavaScript

The 2.x runtime supports the same languages as above and adds Java support.<br>
The 2.x runtime is in preview status at the moment. <br>
The 1.x runtime also supports several experimental languages as follows. <br>
* Python
* PHP
* TypeScript
* Batch (.cmd, .bat)
* Bash
* PowerShell

If you’re using one of these experimental languages, then a support case should not be opened and Microsoft would recommend that you follow these steps.

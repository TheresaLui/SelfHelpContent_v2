# Moving a Function App

## **Recommended Documents**

Azure Function Apps have the same limitations as Azure App Services when [moving the resource across subscriptions or resource groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources).<br>

To move an Azure Function App between the consumption plan and dedicated plan requires a redeployment of the function code to a new function app created in the respective plan. A work item to allow this capability is tracked in the Github issue below:<br>
[How to Migrate from Consumption Plan to App Service Plan (and vice versa)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues/155).

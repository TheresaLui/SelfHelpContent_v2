# Yes, Proof of payment received

<!--issueDescription-->

Thank you for sharing the proof of payment! We will now engage our Global Finance Services team to apply the payment against your account. The Global Finance Services team should provide us an update in 2 to 3 business days and we will get back to you as soon as we hear from them.

# Account admin/contact email of customer profile does not match company tenant details in CMAT/CST

Seek approval from a Global Administrator of the Tenant to validate if the Subscription belongs to the organization, by sending an email to the Global admin of the tenant. You can get the Global Administrator (Company Administrator) email from CMAT/CST when you search with customer's company domain or tenant ID

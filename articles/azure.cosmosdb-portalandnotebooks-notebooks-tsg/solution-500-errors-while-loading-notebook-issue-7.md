# 500 Errors While Loading Notebook issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

If you are receiving 500 errors while loading your notebooks, typically this is caused by exceeding memory in your workspace. Resetting your workspace should correct the problem. 
- Please click on *Reset Workspace* option on data explorer page and allow some time for the operation to complete. Once completed you should be able to recover your notebooks.

Thank you.

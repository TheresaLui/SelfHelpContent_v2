Dear customer,

Built-in notebooks for Azure Cosmos DB are currently available in the following Azure regions: Australia East, East US, East US 2, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, UK South, West Europe and West US 2.
To use notebooks, create a new account with notebooks or enable notebooks on an existing account in one of these regions.

You are unable to create or enable account with Notebooks please follow this document:

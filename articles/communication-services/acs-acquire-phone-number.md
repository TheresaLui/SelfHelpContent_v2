# <-- Cannot acquire a phone number -->

<!--issueDescription-->
Customers are getting an error when trying to acquire a phone number. There are a few reasons of why a user cannot acquire a phone number.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* Sometimes the stock of phone numbers available to purchase runs out. In this case, the phone number type (i.e., Geographic or Toll-free) will be dimmed. 
  If this is the case, check back again after some time has passed.

* Failure because of subscription eligibility:<br>
    * Check the subscription type
    * Check if the billing address is correct

If this didn't solve the issue:<br>
    * Check our [roadmap](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/projects/1)
    * File a [Github issue](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues)

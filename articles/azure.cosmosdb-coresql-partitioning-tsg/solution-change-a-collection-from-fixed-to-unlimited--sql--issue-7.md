Dear customer

The non-partitioned containers are legacy and you should migrate your existing non-partitioned containers to partitioned containers to scale storage and throughput. Azure Cosmos DB provides a system defined mechanism to migrate your non-partitioned containers to partitioned containers. This document explains how all the existing non-partitioned containers are auto-migrated into partitioned containers. You can take advantage of the auto-migration feature only if you are using the V3 version of SDKs in all the languages.

Pleae check the following document for more details:

Thank you.

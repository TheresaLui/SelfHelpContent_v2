## **Recommended Documents**
To use all provisioned throughput, you must avoid skews by choosing a good partition key. To learn more about partitioning and partition key selection, see links below.

[Partition and scale in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data)
<br>This article explains physical and logical partitions in Azure Cosmos DB. It also discusses best practices for scaling and partitioning.  

[How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)
<br>To achieve low latency and high availability, instances of these applications need to be deployed in data centers that are close to their users. These applications are typically deployed in multiple data centers and are called globally distributed. Globally distributed applications need a globally distributed database that can transparently replicate the data anywhere in the world to enable the applications to operate on a copy of the data that's close to its users.

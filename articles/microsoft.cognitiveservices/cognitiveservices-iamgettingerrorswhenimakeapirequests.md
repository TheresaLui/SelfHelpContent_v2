# I am getting 403/429 errors when I make API requests

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following steps.

1. Check the API request status code description. Error code 403: Out of call volume quota. Upgrade to a higher pricing tier or wait for your quota to be replenished in the next billing cycle.
Error code 429: Rate limit is exceeded. Try again or upgrade to a higher pricing tier with higher rate limit.
2. Review the specific API documentation to find more details on specific error codes.

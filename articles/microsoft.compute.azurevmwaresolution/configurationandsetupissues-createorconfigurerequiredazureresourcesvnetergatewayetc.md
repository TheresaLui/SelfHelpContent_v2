# Azure VMware Solution

In order to access private clouds, you are required to create a VNet with associated VM and networking-related resources. Those required resources are described in the recommended documentation.

Review the private cloud documentation for the resources that you are required to create and then review the resource-specific documentation for creating the required resources. If you have issues creating or operating one of those resources, open an SR against that particular Azure resource type; for example, an ExpressRoute gateway.

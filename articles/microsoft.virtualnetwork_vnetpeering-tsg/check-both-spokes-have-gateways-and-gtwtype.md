# Check if both spoke and hub vnets have VPN gateways

When a customer is trying to reach a spoke VNet from on-premises only the hub VNet can have a VPN gateway. Having gateways in both the spoke VNet and the hub VNet will not work.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Understand the customers topology. In ASC, go to Tools > 'Network Topology' to identify the spoke VNets and Hub VNet.
2. While in the 'Network Topology' tool check the **hub** VNet graphic for a VPN gateway icon (looks like a paddle lock)
3. While in the 'Network Topology' tool check the **spoke** VNet graphic for a VPN gateway icon (looks like a paddle lock)

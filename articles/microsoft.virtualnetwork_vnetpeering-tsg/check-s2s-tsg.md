# Referral to site-to-site troubleshooting guide

The customer is not able to connect from their on-premises resources to resources within the VNet that has the VPN gateway (or ExR). This indicates that there is a problem with the basic VPN connection that must be addressed first before troubleshooting the the VNet peering gateway transit aspect.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the ASC Overview page, select the 'Edit and Run again' button
2. Update the Support Area Path (Support Topic) with the appropriate VPN S2S Connectivity option
3. Use the S2S TSG in ASC to resolve the customer's site-to-site connectivity issue.
4. If the issue still persists, use 'Edit and Run again' to update the Support Area Path (Support Topic) back to VNet Peering and use this TSG again.

# Check if re-installing the p2s client package resolves

Point-to-Site client downloads only have the network configuration at the time of the download. Updates to the VNet routing/topology, such as newly peered Vnet routes, are not automatically added to P2S clients so the point-to-site client packages must be redownloaded or the routes must be added manually.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Download P2S client package on the P2S client
2. Install P2S client package
3. Test connectivity

# Web App is not in sync with Vnet routes
<!--issueDescription-->

This issue is caused by the Webapp not having the VNet routes. To allow a Webapp to communicate over a VNet Peering connection the WebApp using VNet integration must have the up-to-date routes. The issue was solved by manually syncing and verifying the correct routes are listed. I have the links to more information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Perform **Sync Network Operation** in the WebApp resource in the Azure portal.
2. Sometimes the Web Apps do not connect because of certificate mismatch.
3. In order to fix this, you need to perform a **Sync Network operation** on the Web App that has the effect of re-configuring Point to Site on it â€“ including all certificates.

# Check Azure platform nsg and routing from source to destination

Use the 'Test Traffic' utility to check for blocking Network Security Group Rules (NSGs) and Routing Rules **leaving the source** toward the destination.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Choose a 'source' VM in one of the peered VNet and a 'destination' VM in the other peered VNet. (For the next several steps we will refer to the VMs you've selected as 'source' & 'destination' VM)
2. Browse to the source VM in ASC Resource Explorer. Click on the Diagnostics tab, and choose Test Traffic.
3. Specify the following options to Test Traffic and then click "Run":
   * Traffic Direction: **Out**
   * Cluster node: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Node Id: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Container Id: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Source IP: client source IP address (Auto Populated by ASC)
   * Source Port: **55555**
   * Destination IP: **enter destination VM private VNet IP**
   * Destination Port: **enter port the customer is testing with**
   * Transport Protocol: **TCP**
4. Make note of the following: 
   * The 'Test Result' for the "Stateful Test (NSG Layer)" and the blocking Rule Name listed.
   * The "Stateless Test (Routing Layer)" any 'NSG or Routing Layer' and the blocking Rule Name listed.

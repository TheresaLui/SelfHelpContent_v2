# Check if customer is using NVA as VPN or Azure VPN gateway

It is important to determine what the customer is using as their VNet VPN. Is it a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) or is it an Azure VPN Gateway?

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Talk to the custoemr to understand their topology. 
2. In ASC, go to Tools > 'Network Topology' to identify the spoke VNets and Hub VNet.
3. While in the 'Network Topology' tool check the **hub** VNet graphic for a VPN gateway icon (looks like a paddle lock)
4. While in the 'Network Topology' tool check the **spoke** VNet graphic for a VPN gateway icon (looks like a paddle lock)

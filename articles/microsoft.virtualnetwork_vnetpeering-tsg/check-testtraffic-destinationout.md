# Check Azure platform nsg & routing from destination to source

Use the 'Test Traffic' utility to check for blocking Network Security Group Rules (NSGs) and Routing Rules **leaving the destination** out to the source VM. (You will leverage the same 'source' and 'destination' VMs as in the previous step. The VMs you labeled as 'source' and 'destination' will maintain that designation for this step)

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Browse to the destination VM in ASC Resource Explorer. Click on the Diagnostics tab, and choose Test Traffic.
2. Specify the following options to Test Traffic and then click "Run":
   * Traffic Direction: Out
   * Cluster node: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Node Id: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Container Id: Auto Populated by ASC
   * Source IP: ***<'Destination' private IP address>
   * Source Port: 55555
   * Destination IP: ***<'Source' private IP address>
   * Destination Port: <choose port the customer is testing with: RDP=80; SSH=22; http=80; https=443>
   * Transport Protocol: TCP
4. Make note of the following: 
   * The 'Test Result' for the "Stateful Test (NSG Layer)" and the blocking Rule Name listed.
   * The "Stateless Test (Routing Layer)" any 'NSG or Routing Layer' and the blocking Rule Name listed.

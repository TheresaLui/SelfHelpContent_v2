# Check VNet Peering How To Scenario

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Talk to the customer to understand clearly their intended peering scenario (get VNet names that they want to connect)
2. In ASC, go to 'Tools' then 'Network Topology' and identify the VNets the customer mentioned
3. Choose a scenario below that fits the customer's desired scenario

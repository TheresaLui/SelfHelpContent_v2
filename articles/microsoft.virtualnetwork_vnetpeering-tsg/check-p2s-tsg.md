# Referral to point-to-site troubleshooting guide

The customer is not able to connect from their point-to-site client to resources within the VNet that has the VPN point-to-site gateway. This indicates that there is a problem with the basic point-to-site VPN connection that must be addressed first before troubleshooting the the VNet peering gateway transit aspect.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Resolve the customer's point-to-site connectivity issue to the resources in the VNet that has the VPN point-to-site gateway using the [Point-to-site TSG](https://centennialtsg.azurewebsites.net/TSG2/123456). 
2. Come back to this TSG if needed when the point-to-site issue is resolved

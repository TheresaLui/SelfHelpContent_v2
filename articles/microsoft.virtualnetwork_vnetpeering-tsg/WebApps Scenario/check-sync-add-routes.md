# Check VNet Integration Sync Status and Add Routes


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Have customer look in Vnet Integration section of the web app to verify you can see the remote Vnet
2. Manually enter in the remote Vnet address space ('Sync Network' & 'Add Routes') if it isn't found in above step
3. Workaround if customer does not want to use 'Preview' feature of VNet integration is to create Site-to-Site between the Vnets

# Check if webapp is using VNet integration

Depending on the WebApp connection type to the VNet we will need to take different steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check the customer verbatim to verify if customer said how their WebApp was connected to the VNet. If the customer did not indicate ask them how their WebApp is connected to the VNet

## **Recommended Documents**

# Job UI issue

If Job UI is not loading or customer is facing error while listing the jobs in the UI,this usually means having outages with Databricks services. Please refer?to [Azure Databricks Status](https://status.azuredatabricks.net)?page.

This needs to involve Databricks team to check the impacted backend service. Please follow this [Wiki Link](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureDataBricks/_wiki/wikis/AzureDataBricks.wiki/312121/Engaging-Databricks-Support) to create the Salesforce ticket.

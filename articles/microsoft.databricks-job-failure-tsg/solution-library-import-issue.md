# Library import issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Jobs can be run on either existing or new cluster. Please double check the following in Job and Cluster configuration:<br>
<br>
1. If Job is run on Existing Cluster, when restarting with libraries, the job WILL NOT WAIT for library installation.<br>
2. If Job is run on New Cluster with a shared library (a library installed on all clusters), the job WILL NOT WAIT for library installation.<br>
<br>

## Solution
<br>
If a job requires a certain library, make sure to attach the library to the job itself, not the cluster.<br>

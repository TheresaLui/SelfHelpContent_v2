# Troubleshooting login performance

Slow login issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps to solve for the most common issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you are maxing out IO, memory or compute resources, scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM use accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* Use connection pooling to avoid the overhead of setting up many short lived connections

# Pods are in an Unhealthy State

 

Check if any events are reported for the pods that your server group is running in by using the below steps

 

## **Recommended Steps**

 

- Get the list of the pods: `Kubectl get pods`    
- **Describe** each of the pods of your server group. The name of the pods follow the pattern server group name - x where x is a number starting at 0:

 

    * 0 is the **coordinator **node
    * X are the **worker **nodes        
    
- For each of the pods run: `kubectl describe pod <server group name> -x`
- Look at the section **Events** at the bottom of the output and see if any problem is indicated. Troubleshoot this problem.
- Alternatively run `kubectl get events` and see if any problem is indicated
- If the problem appears after you changed the configuration of the server group (scale up/down, or server parameters):

 

    * Revert the change 
    * If this solves the problem, review the configuration change you desired and adjust it to what your Kubernetes cluster can deliver
    * If this does not solve the problem, reach out to your Kubernetes team and then to the Microsoft support services if the issue persists

# How to Build a Model using intents in LUIS
Intents in LUIS allow you to identify the intent or objective of a sentence. Train Intents by adding example utterances to an Intent. For example, a "Cancel" intent would include examples such as "I would like to cancel my subscription", "Please cancel that action", "Stop the current action" and other examples that capture the idea of Cancellation.

# Manage Authoring Keys

## **Recommended Steps**

* To link Azure Authoring keys or resources on your application, you must first [Migrate your account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-migration-authoring#what-is-migration)
* To Migrate, you need to create a new authoring resource. **Make sure it is an authoring and not a runtime/prediction LUIS resource**, either from the [LUIS Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-migration-authoring#migration-steps) or from the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription#create-luis-resources-in-azure-portal).
* Create [authoring resources in Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription#create-resources-in-azure-cli)
* Make sure that your account is associated with a valid Azure subscription to be able to create any Azure resource. If you do not have an Azure subscription, create a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* You need to choose the authoring region based on which authoring portal you will build and create your applications in. Please check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions#luis-authoring-regions) 3 LUIS authoring regions and their portals.
* If you are the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription, you can [add a contributor to the authoring resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-collaborate#add-contributor-to-azure-authoring-resource) to collaborate on the same applications
* Learn about the [permissions needed to add contributors to your resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-migration-authoring#add-contributors-to-authoring-resources)
* There is a limit to the number of authoring keys created per subscription per region. This limit is **10 resources per subscription per region**.
* There is a **restriction in the naming conventions for authoring resources**. Names can only include alphanumeric characters and the - character; it must be between 2 and 64 characters in length and cannot end with a '-'.
* [Assign a new authoring resource to your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription#assign-a-resource-to-an-app)
* [Un-assign your authoring resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription#unassign-resource)
* [Reset your authoring key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-azure-subscription#reset-authoring-key) if it is compromised

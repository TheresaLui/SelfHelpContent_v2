# How to use the dashboard

### Getting Started
* LUIS analytics dashboard gives an overview of your **training data's accuracy** and tries to pinpoint weak utterances or intents and gives actionable advice on how to rectify those issues.

* Use the dashboard as guidance on which intents in your training set require more attention.

* If you want to capture **endpoint queries** to ensure that they are predicted correctly, enable [active learning feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-review-endpoint-utterances#enable-active-learning) and [review endpoint utterances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-review-endpoint-utterances#correct-intent-predictions-to-align-utterances).

## **Recommended Steps**

* Learn about [how to make the dashboard improve your LUIS app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-use-dashboard).

* Learn the [insights and issues that can be seen from dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-use-dashboard#what-issues-can-be-fixed-from-dashboard).

* Review your [app's overall accuracy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-use-dashboard#review-training-evaluation).

* [Compare changes across different app versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-use-dashboard#compare-changes-across-versions) and check which one has better prediction accuracy.

* [Review issues in a specific intent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-use-dashboard#intents-with-errors) from the dashboard.

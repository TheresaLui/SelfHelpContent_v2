# LUIS Models Deletion or Backup

## **Recommended Steps**

* You have full control to [delete any user content](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-user-privacy#deleting-customer-data), either through the LUIS web portal or the LUIS Authoring (also known as Programmatic) APIs. You have the ability to:
    * Delete Account
    * Delete Application
    * Delete Utterances
    * Delete End User Queries

* You can take backups from your LUIS applications by exporting the whole app from the LUIS Portal. This is done from the apps page by clicking on the left toggle of the application. On the top bar, a menu will appear that will have an export button. You can either export your application as JSON or LU format.

* You can also export [versions of an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-manage-versions).

* You can export your data via [LUIS Authoring (Programmatic) APIs as in](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-user-privacy#exporting-customer-data).

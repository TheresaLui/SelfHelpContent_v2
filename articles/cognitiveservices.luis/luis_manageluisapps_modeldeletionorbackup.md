# LUIS Models Deletion or Backup

* You have full control to [delete any user content](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-user-privacy#deleting-customer-data), either through the LUIS web portal or the LUIS Authoring (also known as Programmatic) APIs. You have the ability to:
    * Delete Account
    * Delete Application
    * Delete Utterances
    * Delete End User Queries

* You can take backups from your LUIS applications by exporting the whole app from the LUIS Portal. This is done from the apps page by clicking on the left toggle of the application. On the top bar, a menu will appear that will have an export button. You can either export your application as JSON or LU format.

* You can also export your data the LUIS Authoring (Programmatic) APIs as in [here] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-user-privacy#exporting-customer-data).

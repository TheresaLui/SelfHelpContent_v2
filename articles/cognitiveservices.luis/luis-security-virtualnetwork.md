# Virtual Network

### Getting Started

* LUIS provides a layered security model and enables you to secure your account to a specific subset of networks

* When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data over the specified set of networks can access the account. You can limit access to your resources with request filtering.

* Please note that this offering is in private preview. You can [request preview access here](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR3k4-f_9d9xPhWkgOUub9YhUNVhXQk42UlM3Q1ZDMVpMQ01LODQ3RThBMC4u).

# Unable to Sign-in or Unresponsive Portal

* LUIS is a generally available service and portal should always be responsive. If you have trouble with the responsiveness of the portal, please refresh and try using a private window.  

* Make sure that you have been given consent to your application by your Azure Active Directory Tenant admin. Learn more about [AAD Tenant consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-how-to-collaborate#azure-active-directory-tenant-user)

* If still there is an issue, please proceed to open a ticket and elaborate. 

* LUIS, as a REST API, can be used with any product, service, or framework that makes an HTTP request. Learn about [LUISâ€™ many tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/what-is-luis#implementing-luis).

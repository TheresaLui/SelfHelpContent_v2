# Manage Regions and Boundaries

LUIS has 3 authoring regions that are supported by 3 corresponding LUIS portals. Every application in every authoring region has a set of regions you can publish to. To publish a LUIS app to more than one region, you need at least one key per region.

## Getting started

* **What are authoring regions?** Regions where you can build, test and manage your application. LUIS has 3 authoring regions (US, Europe, Australia) and for each region a corresponding portal. Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions#luis-authoring-regions) the corresponding LUIS portal for each region along with the Azure region name.  
* **Do I need to create authoring resources in the same region as the authoring region?**
* **What are publishing regions?**

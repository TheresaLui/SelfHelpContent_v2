# Prebuilt Intent
## **Recommended Documents**

* [Intents in LUIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-intent) allow you to identify the objective of a sentence. Train Intents by adding [example utterances(sentences)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-utterance) to an Intent.

* **Prebuilt intents** are a set of LUIS intents that cover common user objectives such as sending an email or changing a calendar event

* You can [import the intent and its utterances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/howto-add-prebuilt-models#add-a-prebuilt-intent) and modify it to tailor your needs

* You can also choose to import a [Prebuilt domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/howto-add-prebuilt-models#add-a-prebuilt-domain) with the intents and entities available for that domain

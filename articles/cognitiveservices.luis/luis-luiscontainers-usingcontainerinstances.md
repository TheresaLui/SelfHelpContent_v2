# Using Container Instances

## **Recommended Steps**

* When using a container, it needs to be connected to the internet for billing purposes, every 15 minutes

* LUIS is not yet available as a completely offline container

* Learn [how to consume your LUIS runtime in a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/deploy-luis-on-container-instances)

* Learn about [LUIS Pricing details and the transaction per second(TPS) for each key](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/)

* Learn about [LUIS key management experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-keys) and the differences between authoring and prediction keys

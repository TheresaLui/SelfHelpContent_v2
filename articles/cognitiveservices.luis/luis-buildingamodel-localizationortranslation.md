# Localization or translation
## **Recommended Documents**

* LUIS has a variety of features within the service. Not all features are at the same language parity. Make sure the [features you are interested in are supported in the language culture you are targeting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-language-support).

* A LUIS app is culture-specific and cannot be changed once it is set during [app creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/get-started-portal-build-app#create-an-app)

* You can localize your LUIS portal to any of the following languages: English, Deutsch, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese and Japanese

* To change the localization of your portal, click on the settings icon on the top bar and choose from the list of dropdown your desired language

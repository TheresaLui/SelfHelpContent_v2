# Install and Configure Containers

## **Recommended Steps**

* After you publish an application, you use the LUIS runtime using a URL in the shared runtime.

* Alternatively, you can [package your published LUIS models](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-container-howto?tabs=v3#export-packaged-app-from-luis) into a container and directly use the container for the runtime.

* Containers give you the freedom to manage your LUIS application in a connected container environment.

* You can also use containers as a work around if you go beyond the [allowed transaction per second in your resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/).

* Learn [how to install and configure containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-container-howto)

* Learn about [LUIS key management experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-keys) and the differences between authoring and prediction keys.

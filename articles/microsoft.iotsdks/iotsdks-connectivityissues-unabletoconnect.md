# Unable to connect issues

## **Recommended steps**

1. Validate IoTHub is available
   * Use latest [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/DeviceExplorer)<br>
   * Enter IoTHub connection string in Device Explorer<br>
   * List devices <br>
     Note: If you are unable to get the list of devices , then, one of the following could be the issue :<br>
     - AMQP Ports could be blocked.<br>
	 - IoTHub could be down. Check for outages [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/)<br>
   * Run diagnostics (need NPM capability) <br>

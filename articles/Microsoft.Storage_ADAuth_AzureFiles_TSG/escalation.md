# AD Auth for Files Storage escalation path

## Standard Escalation

* If you have reached this step, it means that something which is supposed to work in a certain way, doesn't work because of an issue on the Azure side
* The escalation process is as usual raising the issue on [AD Auth teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ab08416c6a6054c029ce025987dc70850%40thread.skype/AD%2520DS%2520Auth%2520for%2520Azure%2520Files?groupId=082ae864-dfc1-4ae5-b096-6e1e878b339e&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) and get help from the Technical Advisors using Ava Bot.
* TA must determine if we got to this point because we didn't properly follow the TSG and should have checked something else, or may determine this is an issue that requires an PG involvement. They will escalate issue as needed. 
* Provide the channel  "TSG History" from the TSG History button to help expedite the escalation process
* Additionally, use the feedback button below to capture and improvements to the TSG

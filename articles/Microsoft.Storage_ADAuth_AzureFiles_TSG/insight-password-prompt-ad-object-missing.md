# Unable to mount - Storage Account's AD object is missing in On-Prem Active Directory
<!--issueDescription-->
In order for AD Auth to work properly, the logged on user needs to have a valid AD Object associated with the storage account they are trying to connect to.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Please work with the customer and recreate the AD Object using "Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth" cmdlet. Please run the cmdlet with "-verbose" option in order to see if the customer is facing any issues creating this AD Object. 
2. Once the AD Object is created successfully, re-run the "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" cmdlet to make sure all the other checks pass successfully. If they do not, go back to previous step to further troubleshoot. 
3. If "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" completes successfully, ask the customer to try mounting the file share. If mount still fails, escalate.

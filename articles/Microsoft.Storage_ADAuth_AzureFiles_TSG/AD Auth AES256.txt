# Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth fails when the customer is trying to enable AES256 encryption on the storage account

<!--issueDescription-->
Customer gets the following error while running the Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth command if they are trying to enable AES256 encryption. 

Parameter -StorageAccountName has more than 15 characters, which is not supported to be used as the SamAccountName to create an Active Directory Object. 
 
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Recommended Action**

This is a known limitation of using AES256 encryption. If you try and domain join a storage account that is longer than 15 characters it will currently fail, you would need to use a storage name shorter than 15 characters or use RC4 encryption instead of AES256. Please ask the to create a storage account which has a name shorter than 15 characters if they want to use AES256 encryption.

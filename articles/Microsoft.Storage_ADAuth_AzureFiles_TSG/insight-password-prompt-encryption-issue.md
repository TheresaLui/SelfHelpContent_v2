# Unable to mount - User is not able to retrieve the Kerberos ticket
<!--issueDescription-->
In order for AD Auth to work properly, we need a valid Kerberos ticket to connect to the storage account. The customers may run into issue with CheckGetKerberosTicket step if their domain group policy does not have supported Kerberos encryption type enabled or if the client has cached credentials for the storage account (in windows Credential manager) for the storage account and key..
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check the error message that the customer sees during the CheckGetKerberosTicket step. If the error message is "0x80090303/-2146893053: The specified target is unknown or unreachable", follow the steps defined below:

    * Run "Cmdkey /list" command from the PowerShell console. This will show a list of all cached credentials on the Windows client.
    * Look for any credentials in this list with the target equal to <storageaccountname>.file.core.windows.net. Example below:
    
    ```
      Target: Domain:target=aaddsrgdiag721.file.core.windows.net
      Type: Domain Password
      User: Azure\AADDsrgdiag721
    ```
    
    * Run "Cmdkey /delete:<TARGETNAMEFROMLISTABOVE>" to delete cached credentials. Example below:
    
    ```
            Z:\>cmdkey /delete:Domain:target=aaddsrgdiag721.file.core.windows.net
            CMDKEY: Credential deleted successfully.
    ```
    
    * Re-run the Debug command. If it still fails, proceed to next step. 

2. The customer (or their domain administrator) needs to examine their domain group policy for [encryption types allowed for Kerberos](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-configure-encryption-types-allowed-for-kerberos). We currently support RC4-HMAC and AES 256 encryption. AES 128 Kerberos encryption is not yet supported.
3. Make sure RC4_HMAC or AES_256 are included as a value. If the customer has questions about support for AES 128 Encryption type, please follow the appropriate escalation model to engage with PG. 
4. Once we have verified that customerâ€™s domain policy has supported Kerberos encryption type enabled, there is nothing needed to be done if RC4 HMAC is being used. 
5. But in case AES 256 encryption type is being enforced, there are additional steps to follow in order to enable it at the storage account level. 
    * We introduced AES 256 Kerberos encryption support for Azure Files on-prem AD DS authentication with AzFilesHybrid module v0.2.2.
    * Please ask the customer to run [Update-AzStorageAccountAuthForAES256](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-windows-file-connection-problems#azure-files-on-premises-ad-ds-authentication-support-for-aes-256-kerberos-encryption) PowerShell command to enable AES 256 support. This command is only available with AzFilesHybrid module v0.2.2.
6. Once the appropriate changes have been made, re-run the "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" cmdlet to make sure all the other checks pass successfully. If they do not, go back to previous step of the troubleshooter to further troubleshoot. 
7. If "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" completes successfully, ask the customer to try mounting the file share. If mount still fails, escalate.

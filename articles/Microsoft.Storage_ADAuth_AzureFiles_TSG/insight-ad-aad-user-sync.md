# Unable to mount - Logged on AD user is not synced to Azure AD
<!--issueDescription-->
In order for AD Auth to work properly, logged on AD user's identity must be synced to Azure AD.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Please engage the AAD team to verify customer's AAD Sync setup and take their help to resolve this sync issue. Use this support topic path to cut a collaboration task with them: "Azure/Azure Active Directory User Provisioning and Synchronization/Syncing from AD to AAD"
2. Once AAD sync issue is resolved, re-run the "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" cmdlet to make sure all the other checks pass successfully. If they do not, go back to previous step to further troubleshoot. 
3. If "Debug-AzStorageAccountAuth" completes successfully, ask the customer to try mounting the file share. If mount still fails, escalate.

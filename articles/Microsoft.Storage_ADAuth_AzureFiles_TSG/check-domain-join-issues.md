# Customer is facing domain join issues

If the script does not work as expected, verify that the customer has the supported [Az.Storage 1.11.1-preview module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage/1.11.1-preview) installed in their environment.

Once verified that the customer has right Az.Storage module installed, please ask them to run the Join command using '-verbose' option and share the result.

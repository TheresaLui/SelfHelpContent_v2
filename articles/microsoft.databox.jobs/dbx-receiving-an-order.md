# Order fulfilment

## **Recommended Steps**

## Query about order status

The Data Box service *does not guarantee any SLA* for the order fulfilment and completion. The estimated lead times at each step of the order lifecycle are as follows - 

  1.	Order Azure Data Box/Data Box Disk – few minutes, from the portal
  2.	Device allocation and preparation – 1-2 business days
  3.	Shipping – 2-3 business days
  4.	Data copy at customer site – Depends on nature of data, size and number of files
  5.	Return shipping – 2-3 business days
  6.	Processing device at Datacenter – 1-2 business days
  7.	Upload data to Azure – Copy will begin as soon as processing is done and device is connected, completion depends on nature of data, size and number of files.

These are only estimates and subject to vary depending on inventory availability, processing capacity and other factors at the datacenter. Please note that orders are processed and shipped at datacenters worldwide only on business days.
When a shipment is in transit, tracking information is updated in the Overview page in the portal.

## Status of sign up requests

If you submitted a sign up request for a Data Box, Data Box Disk or Data Box Heavy, we will review the details of the request and get back to you soon. Please note that if your subscription has been enabled to place an order, you will need to do this step from the Azure portal. Signing up does not automatically create an order.

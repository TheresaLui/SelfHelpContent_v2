# Can't schedule a pick-up

For Data Box orders, the return shipping label and reference number will be available for scheduling a pickup only after you complete the Prepare to ship process without any major errors. If you have issues with scheduling a pickup with the carrier, and have the reference number, contact adbops@microsoft.com.

For any other issues regarding pickup for Data Box and Data Box Disk orders, check the escalation path provided under **Overview** > **View ship instructions** for your order in the Azure portal.

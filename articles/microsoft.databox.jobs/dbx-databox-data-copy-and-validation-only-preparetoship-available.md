# Data Box - Data copy and validation

**Can't use the device, only "Prepare to ship" is available**

Check if the system fault indicator light on the front operating panel is **On**. To rule out any issues with device location and operating conditions, try moving the device to a different location with better ventilation and air flow. Check if the fault indicator light turns off, and if the device is usable.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you are still unable to access the device, continue to log a [Support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox/data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support)
2. Depending on the issue, if it is a hardware failure, you will be asked to return the device and create a new order. A replacement device will be sent to you.

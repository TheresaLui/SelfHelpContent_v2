# Azure Data Box setup and configuration

**The E-ink display has an issue**

Ensure that the prepare to ship command has run successfully on the Data Box device without any critical errors. This is a mandatory step before the device can be returned. After prepare to ship completes, the E-ink display automatically changes to show the return shipping address.

In case of any issues with the e-ink display, continue to log a support ticket. After you receive a confirmation from Microsoft Support, download the label from the Azure portal under **Overview** > **Download shipping label**. To ship the device back, prepare it for shipping and affix the printed paper label.

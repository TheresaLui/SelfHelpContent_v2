# Data Box setup and configuration

**The E-ink display has an issue**

Ensure that prepare to ship has run successfully on the Data Box device without any critical errors. This is a mandatory step before the device can be shipped back to Azure. Once prepare to ship completes, the e-ink display will automatically change to display the return shipping address.

In case of any issues with the e-ink display, continue to log a support ticket. After getting a confirmation from Microsoft Support, the label can be downloaded from the Azure portal under Overview -> Download shipping label. You will need to package the box and affix the printed paper label in order to ship the device back.

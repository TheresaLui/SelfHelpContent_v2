# Encryption using Customer managed key

## **Recommended Steps**

### Order is halted after a customer managed key error

If you had used a customer managed key to encrypt the device unlock password and there was an issue with the key, check if it is recoverable. See [Troubleshooting errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal#troubleshoot-errors) 
If access to the customer managed key has been restored, continue to log a support ticket so that the order can be unblocked.

# Self-managed shipping

## **Recommended Steps**

### Unable to find the authorization code

For Data Box and Data Box Disk, if self-managed shipping was chosen at the time of order creation, then an authorization code is required to be presented at the datacenter both during pick-up and drop-off. 

Pick-up
1. After scheduling an appointment with Azure Data Box operations for the pick-up, the authorization code will be available when you click *Schedule pickup* in the Overview page
2. Make a note of this code to be presented at the datacenter along with the other details as mentioned under *Pickup from Azure DC*

Drop-off
1. For Data Box Disk, once you have scheduled an appointment with Azure Data Box operations for the drop-off, the authorization code will be available when you click *Schedule drop off* in the Overview page
2. For Data Box, once 'Prepare to Ship' has completed successfully, the authorization code is available in the device local user interface. After this step, you may schedule an appointment with Azure Data Box operations to drop off the device

# Monetary commitment and unbilled usage

Azure monetary commitment is an amount paid up front for Azure services. The monetary commitment is consumed as services are used. First-party Azure services use the monetary commitment. However, there are exceptions for charges billed separately and marketplace services.

_Charges Billed Separately_ and _Azure Marketplace Services_ are third-party services that are deployed from the Azure Marketplace platform. The main difference between the two services is how they're invoiced, based on the agreement structure established with third-party publishers.

Third-party usage appears on your invoice under **Charges Billed Separately**. The usage consumes your Azure monetary commitment balance. To view the list of third-party services, see [Azure Marketplace third-party reseller services now use Azure monetary commitment](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-marketplace-third-party-reseller-services-now-use-azure-monetary-commitment).

Usage on your invoice that appears under **Azure Marketplace** is charged separately. It is not covered by any monetary commitment. However, all charges including marketplace, overage, and charges billed separately are consolidated on a single invoice. You receive a single invoice for Azure first-party overage and Azure third-party marketplace purchases.

When your monetary commitment is fully consumed, usage is billed on a monthly or quarterly basis. If your enrollment started before May 2018, then a 150% monetary commitment threshold rule applies, and you're billed for overages quarterly. If your enrollment started after May 2018, then all overages are billed monthly.

# Request detailed usage

Enterprise admins can view a summary of their usage data, monetary commitment consumed, and charges associated with additional usage in the Azure EA portal. The charges are presented at the summary level across all accounts and subscriptions.

To view detailed usage in specific accounts, you can download the Usage Detail report by navigating to **Reports** > **Download Usage**. The report doesn't include any applicable taxes. There might be a latency of up to eight hours from the time when usage was incurred to when it's reflected on the report.

For indirect enrollments, your partner needs to enable the markup function before you can see any cost-related information.

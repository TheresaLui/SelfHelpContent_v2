# Understanding your bill

Azure customers with an Enterprise Agreement receive an invoice when they exceed the organization's credit or use services that aren't covered by the credit.

Your organization's credit includes your monetary commitment. The monetary commitment is the amount your organization paid upfront for usage of Azure services. You can add monetary commitment funds to your Enterprise Agreement by contacting your Microsoft account manager or reseller.

### Credits and Adjustments

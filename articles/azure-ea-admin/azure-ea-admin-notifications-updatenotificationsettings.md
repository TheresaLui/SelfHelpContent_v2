# Update notification settings

Enterprise Administrators are automatically enrolled to receive usage notifications associated to their enrollment. Each Enterprise Administrator can change the interval of the individual notifications or can turn them off completely.

Notification contacts are shown in the Azure EA portal in the **Notification Contact** section. Managing your notification contacts makes sure that the right people in your organization get Azure EA notifications.

To View current notifications settings:

1. In the Azure EA portal, navigate to **Manage** > **Notification Contact**
1. Email Address: The email address associated with the Enterprise Administrator's Microsoft Account, Work, or School Account that receives the notifications
1. Unbilled Balance Notification Frequency: The frequency that notifications are set to send to each individual Enterprise Administrator

To add a contact:

1. Click **+Add Contact**
1. Enter the email address and then confirm it
1. Click **Save**

The new notification contact is displayed in the **Notification Contact** section. To change the notification frequency, select the notification contact and click the pencil symbol to the right of the selected row. Set the frequency to **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**, or **none**.

You can suppress _approaching coverage period end date_ and _disable and de-provision date approaching_ lifecycle notifications. Disabling lifecycle notifications suppresses notifications about the coverage period and agreement end date.

### Manage partner notifications

Partner Administrators can manage the frequency that they receive usage notifications for their enrollments. They automatically receive weekly notifications of their unbilled balance. They can change the frequency of individual notifications to monthly, weekly, daily or turn them off completely.

If a notification isn't received by a user, verify that the user's notification settings are correct with the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure EA portal as a Partner Administrator1. Click **Manage** and then click the **Partner** tab
1. View the list of administrators under the **Administrator** section
1. To edit notification preferences, hover over the appropriate administrator and click the pencil symbol
1. Up the notification frequency and lifecycle notifications as needed
1. Click **Save**

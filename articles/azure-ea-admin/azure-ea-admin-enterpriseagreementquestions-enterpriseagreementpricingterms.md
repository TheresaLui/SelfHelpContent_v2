# Enterprise agreement pricing & terms

### Enrollment status

An enrollment has one of the following status values. Each value determines how you can use and access an enrollment. The enrollment status will determine at which stage your enrollment is, it will tell you if the enrollment needs to be activated before it can be used or if the initial period has expired and you will be charged for overage for any usage.

**Pending**: The enrollment administrator needs to sign in to the Azure EA portal. Once signed in, the enrollment switches to Active status.

**Active**: The enrollment is accessible and usable. You can create accounts and subscriptions in the Azure EA portal. The enrollment remains active until the enterprise agreement end date.

**Indefinite Extended Term**: Indefinite extended term status occurs after the enterprise agreement end date is reached. Before the EA enrollment reaches the enterprise agreement end date, the Enrollment Administrator should decide to:

- Renew the enrollment by adding additional Monetary Commitment
- Transfer the existing enrollment to a new enrollment
- Migrate to the Microsoft Online Subscription Program (MOSP)
- Confirm disablement of all services associated with the enrollment

**Expired**: When the EA enrollment reaches the enterprise agreement end date, the enrollment expires.  The EA customer is opted out of the extended term and all of their services are disabled.

As of 8/1/2019, new opt-out forms aren't accepted for Azure commercial customers. Instead, all enrollments go into indefinite extended term. If you want to stop using Azure services, close your subscription in the Azure portal. Or, your partner can submit a termination request at  [https://www.explore.ms](https://www.explore.ms). There's no change for customers with government agreement types.

**Transferred**: Transferred status is applied to enrollments that have their associated accounts and services transferred to a new enrollment. Enrollments don't automatically transfer if a new enrollment number is generated during renewal. The prior enrollment number must be included in the customer's renewal request for an automatic transfer.

### Price protection and increasing costs

A customer's baseline pricing is the locked-in, guaranteed price. It's protected by the Enterprise Azure Retail Pricing that was published when the Agreement was fully executed. After the initial enrollment term expires, prices revert to pay-as-you-go pricing.

To view your negotiated Price Sheet in the Azure EA portal, go to Reports > Click Price Sheet > Download.

If you're an indirect customer, contact your partner to get their pricing sheet and details about pricing.

If you require special pricing and Azure Commitment Discount (ACD) amendments, you need to discuss them with your account team. The Azure Ops team can apply ACD after an amendment has been processed by the Business Desk ​and requested to Azure Ops team. ACD discount is only applied to the current month. Any previous months are compensated by backdated credit.

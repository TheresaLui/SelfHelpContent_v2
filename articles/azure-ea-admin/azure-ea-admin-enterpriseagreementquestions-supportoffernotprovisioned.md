# Support offer not provisioned

You can order Standard or Pro-Direct support by purchasing support-specific SKUs. The order is similar to a EA Azure Monetary SKU purchase order. For example, 6QK-00001. Support SKU numbers are W6T-00002 (Pro-Direct) and W6T-00003 (Standard). Check the current support offers before you purchase support SKUs.

The enrollment must have at least one active account for the support offer to be provisioned.

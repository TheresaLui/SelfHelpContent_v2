# No activation email received

An activation email from the Azure EA portal is sent from [waep@microsoft.com](mailto:waep@microsoft.com). If you didn't receive an activation email, check your spam or junk folder for the email. It's sent with _Invitation to View/Manage the Microsoft Azure service_ subject. It's sent to every newly added EA administrator.

If you're sure that you've been set up as the EA administrator, you don't have to wait to receive the activation email to sign into the Azure EA portal. Instead, you can go to [https://ea.azure.com](https://ea.azure.com) and sign in with your email address (work, school, or Microsoft account) and your password.

If you need to check the primary alias, go to [https://account.live.com](https://account.live.com/) and click **Your Info**, then **Manage how to you sign into Microsoft**. Follow the prompts to verify an alternate email address and obtain a code to access sensitive information. Enter the security code. Select **Set it up later** if you don't want to set up two-factor authentication.

You'll see the **Manage how to sign into Microsoft** page where view the account aliases that you have. Check that the primary alias is the one that you're using to sign into the Azure EA portal. If it isn't, you can make it your primary alias or you can use the primary alias for Azure EA portal instead.

# Creating a QnA Service

### **Frequently asked questions**

* **Why is my service region shown as West-US, when I selected some other region?**<br>
Your data is stored in the region you choose for your Azure Search Service and App Service. [QnA Maker management layer is present in only West-US](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/concepts/azure-resources#management-service-region) which is used for only QnA Maker portal and no customer data is stored there ever.

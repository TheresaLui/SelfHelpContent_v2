# Troubleshoot Runbook Execution in Azure Automation - Job Completed With Errors

Here are some common issues with executing runbooks in Azure Automation and how to address them. Please note that Support will not write a new script for you based on your needs, but we will work with you to ensure your existing script executes correctly inside of Azure Automation. 

## **Recommended Steps**

Specific problems and their solutions are listed below, but we highly recommend you try these two troubleshooting steps first:

* Try running the [runbook locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#runbook-fails) before running it in Azure Automation. This can clarify if the issue is a bug in the runbook versus an issue with Azure Automation.
* Investigate runbook [error streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-output-and-messages#runbook-output) for specific messages and compare them to the errors below
* [Add additional output](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-output-and-messages#message-streams) to the runbook to identify where the error occurs 

### Inconsistent behavior in runbooks

* Follow the guidance in [Runbook Execution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-execution#runbook-behavior) to avoid issues with concurrent jobs, resources getting created multiple times, or other timing-sensitive logic in runbooks

### Switching between multiple subscriptions in a runbook

* Follow the guidance in [Working with multiple subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-execution#working-with-multiple-subscriptions)

### Runbook fails with error "The subscription cannot be found"

* This issue can occur when the runbook isn't using a RunAs account to access Azure resources. To resolve, follow the steps in [Scenario: Unable to find the Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#unable-to-find-subscription). 

### "Your azure credentials have not been set up or have expired, please run connect-azureRmAccount to set up your azure credentials"

* This error can occur when you are not using a RunAs account or the RunAs account has expired. See ["Manage Azure Automation RunAs accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account).

### "Run Login-AzureRmAccount to login"

* This error can occur when you are not using a RunAs account or the RunAs account has expired. See ["Manage Azure Automation RunAs accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account).

### Runbook fails with error "Strong authentication enrollment is required"

* See ["Authentication to Azure failed because multi-factor authentication is enabled" in the Runbook troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#auth-failed-mfa)

### Runbook fails with "No permission", "Forbidden", 403 or some variation

* RunAs accounts may not have the same permissions against Azure resources as your current account. Ensure your RunAs account [has permissions to access any resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) used in your script. 

### Runbooks were working, but suddenly stopped

* If runbooks were previously executing but stopped, [ensure the RunAs account has not expired](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#cert-renewal)
* If you are using webhooks to start runbooks, [ensure the webhook has not expired](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-webhooks#renew-webhook)

### Passing parameters into webhooks

* For help passing parameters into webhooks, see [Start a runbook from a webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-webhooks#parameters)

### "The term <X> is not recognized..."

* Follow the steps in ["Cmdlet not recognized" in the runbook troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#cmdlet-not-recognized)

### Errors about "TypeData"

* If you are receiving errors about TypeData, you are running a PowerShell Workflow with modules that do not support Workflow. You need to change the runbook type to PowerShell. See ["Runbook types" for more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-types#powershell-runbooks).

### Using Az modules

* Using Az modules and AzureRM modules in the same Automation Account is not supported. Please see ["Az modules in runbooks" for more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/az-modules).

### Using Self-Signed Certificates

* To use Self-Signed certificates you must follow the guide at [Creating a New Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/shared-resources/certificates#creating-a-new-certificate)

If none of the above solutions address your problem, please follow the steps in [Data to gather when opening a case for Azure Automation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3178510) before opening a case. This will help us resolve your case as quickly as possible.

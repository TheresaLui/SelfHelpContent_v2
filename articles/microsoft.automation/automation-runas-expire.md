# Azure Automation - Expired or Expiring Run As Accounts 
RunAs accounts are used by Azure Automation to help authenticate against Azure resources.

## **Recommended Steps**

In order to manage RunAs accounts, you will need permissions as listed at ["Permissions Required to Manage RunAs Accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#permissions)

### Renewing self-signed certificate

* Before your RunAs certificate expires, you can renew it by following the Cert Renewal instructions at ["Manage RunAs Accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#cert-renewal).

### Recreating RunAs Account

* After your RunAs certificate expires, you will have to delete it and create a new one by following the instructions for ["Delete and recreate an Azure RunAs account"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#delete-a-run-as-or-classic-run-as-account)

### I want to start/stop VMs

* See [Start/Stop VMs during off-hours](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management) for information on permissions needed to create RunAs accounts related to the Start/Stop solution

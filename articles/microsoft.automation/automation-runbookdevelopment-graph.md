# Azure Automation - Graphical PowerShell Runbook Development
Here are some common issues when creating new runbooks for use with Azure Automation.

## **Recommended Steps**

Specific problems and their solutions are listed below, but we highly recommend you try these this first:

* Try [executing the runbook locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#runbook-fails) before running it in Azure Automation. This can clarify if the issue is a bug in the runbook versus an issue with Azure Automation.
* Review the [Graphical runbook SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/graphical-runbook-sdk)

**Runbook fails with "Command not found" or "Cannot bind parameter" message**

* You may need to [update the Azure modules in your automation account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-azure-modules)
* If running locally or on a hybrid worker, ensure the machine running the scripts has the same modules versions as your Automation Account by running `Get-Module -ListAvailable`

**Runbook fails with error "The subscription cannot be found"**

* This issue can occur when the runbook isn't using a RunAs account to access Azure resources. To resolve, follow the steps in [Scenario: Unable to find the Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#unable-to-find-subscription). 

**Runbook fails with error "Strong authentication enrollment is required"**

* See ["Authentication to Azure failed because multi-factor authentication is enabled" in the Runbook troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/runbooks#auth-failed-mfa)

**"Your azure credentials have not been set up or have expired, please run connect-azureRmAccount to set up your azure credentials"**

* This error can occur when you are not using a RunAs account or the RunAs account has expired. See ["Manage Azure Automation RunAs accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account).

**Runbook fails with "No permission" or some variation**

* RunAs accounts may not have the same permissions against Azure resources as your current account. Ensure your RunAs account [has permissions to access any resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) used in your script.

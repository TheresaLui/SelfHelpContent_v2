# Resolve Update Management issues with Azure Automation - Enabling Update Management

This article will help with several kinds of issues relating to enabling the Azure Update Management solution.

## **Recommended Steps**

First, try running the Update Agent Troubleshooter ([Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues), [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues-linux)) which addresses many common issues. 

### **Permissions needed to enable and use Update Management**

* You may receive the message "... does not have permission to perform action Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write" if you do not have permissions on the VMs you wish to deploy updates on
* Review ["Role-Based Access Control"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-role-based-access-control#update-management)

### **Desired automation account, region, or Log Analytics workspace is greyed out**

* Only certain regions are supported for linking Log Analytics and Automation Accounts, which is required for Update Management. See the ["Workspace Mappings"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/how-to/region-mappings) document for the full list of supported regions.

### **Machine isn't onboarding after waiting 15 minutes**

* Refer to the ["Components enabled but not working" section of the Update Management Troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#components-enabled-not-working)

### **Update Agent Readiness doesn't show "ready"**

* For Azure VMs: run the troubleshooter from the "troubleshoot" link in the agent health report
* For non-Azure VMs, or if the troubleshooter doesn't work, see the ["Troubleshoot Offline"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues#troubleshoot-offline) section of the Update Agent troubleshooter guide
* Consult the [Update Agent Troubleshooter document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues#prerequisite-checks) for any checks that failed in order to remediate issues

### **The solution cannot be enabled on this VM because the VM already has the management agent..."**

* This error occurs when a machine is already enrolled into Update Management
* A common cause is when [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/) already manages a machine

### **Machine shows as "not assessed"**

Information can take a few minutes to propagate through Log Analytics, but if machines still show "not assessed", then:

* If you see an error code like "Exception from HRESULT 0x...", follow the troubleshooting guide for ["Machine shows as Not Assessed and shows an HResult exception"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#hresult)
* Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs)

### **"You have requested to create an update configuration on a machine that is not registered for Update Management"**

* This issue is commonly related to Scope Configuration:

  * Option 1) [Update the scope configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account#scope-configuration) to add the desired machines
  * Option 2) (Recommended) [Disable Scope Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account#all-available-and-future-machines) and register all machines in the workspace for Update Management

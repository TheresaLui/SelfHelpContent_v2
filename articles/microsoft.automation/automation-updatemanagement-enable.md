# Resolve Update Management issues with Azure Automation - Enabling Update Management

This article will help with several kinds of issues relating to enabling the Azure Update Management solution.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Desired automation account, region, or Log Analytics workspace is greyed out**

* Only certain regions are supported for linking Log Analytics and Automation Accounts, which is required for Update Management. See the ["Workspace Mappings"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/how-to/region-mappings) document for the full list of supported regions.

### **Machine isn't onboarding after waiting 15 minutes**

* Refer to [the "Components enabled but not working" section of the Update Management Troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#components-enabled-not-working)

### **Update Agent Readiness doesn't show "ready"**

* For Azure VMs: run the troubleshooter from the "troubleshoot" link in the agent health report
* For non-Azure VMs, or if the troubleshooter doesn't work, see the ["Troubleshoot Offline"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues#troubleshoot-offline) section of the Update Agent troubleshooter guide
* Consult the [Update Agent Troubleshooter document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues#prerequisite-checks) for any checks that failed in order to remediate issues

### **The solution cannot be enabled on this VM because the VM already has the management agent..."**

* This error occurs when a machine is already enrolled into Update Management
* A common cause is when [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/) already manages a machine.

### **Machine shows as "not assessed"**

Information can take a few minutes to propagate through Log Analytics, but if machines still show "not assessed", then:

* Check for a [Log Analytics heartbeat](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-management#confirm-that-non-azure-machines-are-onboarded)
* If there is no heartbeat, check the [Solution Scoping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account#scope-configuration) is correct
* If there is a heartbeat, follow the steps in the [Data not Showing in Log Analytics section of the Update Management troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs)
* If there is an error code listed, see the [list of potential errors in the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#hresult).

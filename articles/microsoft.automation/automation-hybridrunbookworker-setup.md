# Azure Automation - Setup Hybrid Runbook Worker

## **Recommended Steps**

Many issues with Hybrid Workers are caused by connectivity problems. Run [the "Test Cloud Connectivity" tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows-troubleshoot#connectivity-issues) to ensure your environment is properly configured. 

You can run the [offline version of the Agent Registration script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues#troubleshoot-offline) to find more detailed troubleshooting on prerequisites for the Hybrid Worker. Although this script performs some checks related to Update Management, most requirements are the same for hybrid workers. 

### **Ensure the agent is present** 

* For **Linux**, ensure the agent is running by following the [Linux OMS Agent troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#oms-agent-not-running)
* For **Windows**, ensure the agent is running by following the [Windows MMA troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#mma-not-running)

### **Error: Job action 'Activate' cannot be run...**

* See the [hybrid runbook worker troubleshooting guide under "Runbook execution fails"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#runbook-execution-fails)

### **No certificate was found in the certificate store**

* To resolve this issue, follow the ["No Certificate was Found" section of the Hybrid Worker troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#no-cert-found)

### **Error: "Machine is already registered"**

* Follow the troubleshooting guide for ["Unable to add a Hybrid Runbook Worker"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#already-registered)

### **"Last seen time" not updated**

* If the hybrid worker isn't reporting to the Azure Automation service, follow the [Troubleshoot Hybrid Runbook Worker](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker) guide for your OS
* Review the [network planning guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker#network-planning) and ensure you have connectivity to the service

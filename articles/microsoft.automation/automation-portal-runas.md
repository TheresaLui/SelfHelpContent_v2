# Azure Automation - Run As Accounts
RunAs accounts are used by Azure Automation to help authenticate against Azure resources.

##**Recommended Steps**
**I can't create or renew a RunAs account / RunAs is greyed out**

* RunAs and Classic RunAs accounts are greyed out when you do not have sufficient permissions
* You might also see the message "You do not have permissions to createâ€¦"
* See the ["Unable to Update or Create RunAs account"section of the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/shared-resources#unable-create-update) 

**Using RunAs with a Hybrid Worker**

* You might see the error "No certificate was found in the certificate store"
* To resolve this issue, follow the ["No Certificate was Found" section of the Hybrid Worker troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#no-cert-found)

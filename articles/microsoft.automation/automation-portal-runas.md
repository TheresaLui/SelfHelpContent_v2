# Azure Automation: Common issues with Run As accounts
This article provides resources to help you resolve common issues with Run As accounts. 

* **Run As/Classic Run As accounts are unavailable**
   
   If you do not have sufficient permissions, **Run As** and**Classic Run As** accounts appear dimmed. To create or update a Run As account, make sure that you have the [permissions required to create a Run As or Classic Run As account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#permissions).

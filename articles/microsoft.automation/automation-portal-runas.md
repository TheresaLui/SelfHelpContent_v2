# Azure Automation - Run As Accounts
RunAs accounts are used by Azure Automation to help authenticate against Azure resources.

## **Recommended Steps**

### I can't create or renew a RunAs account / RunAs is greyed out

* RunAs and Classic RunAs accounts are greyed out when you do not have sufficient permissions
* You might also see the message "You do not have permissions to createâ€¦"
* See the ["Unable to Update or Create RunAs account"section of the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/shared-resources#unable-create-update) 

### Renewing self-signed certificate

* Before your RunAs certificate expires, you can renew it by following the Cert Renewal instructions at ["Manage RunAs Accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#cert-renewal).

### Recreating RunAs Account

* After your RunAs certificate expires, you will have to delete it and create a new one by following the instructions for ["Delete and recreate an Azure RunAs account"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#delete-a-run-as-or-classic-run-as-account)

### Using RunAs with a Hybrid Worker

* You might see the error "No certificate was found in the certificate store"
* To resolve this issue, follow the ["No Certificate was Found" section of the Hybrid Worker troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#no-cert-found)

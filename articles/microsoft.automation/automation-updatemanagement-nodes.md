# Resolve Update Management issues with Azure Automation - Machines not listed

This article will help with several kinds of issues relating to machines not showing up in the Azure Update Management solution.

## **Recommended Steps**

The Update Agent Troubleshooter ([Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues), [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues-linux))  will detect common issues such as restrictive firewalls, missing prerequisites, or misconfigured registry keys. 

### **Machines not showing up in the portal**

* Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs) for instructions on how to:
  * Make sure that your machine is reporting to the correct workspace
  * Make sure Scope Configuration is not preventing your machine from enrolling in Update Management
  * Check your Log Analytics configuration to ensure log ingestion is working
  

### **Update Agent Readiness shows "Not Configured" or "Not Assessed"**

* Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs) to check for the most recent reports from machines and common solutions
* If you see an error code like "Exception from HRESULT 0x...", follow the troubleshooting guide for ["Machine shows as Not Assessed and shows an HResult exception"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#hresult)
  * This error commonly indicates an inaccessible WSUS server has been configured, or Windows Update is not reachable on the network.

# Resolve Update Management issues with Azure Automation - Machines not listed

This article will help with several kinds of issues relating to machines not showing up in the Azure Update Management solution.

## **Recommended Steps**

First, try running the Update Agent Troubleshooter ([Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues), [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-agent-issues-linux)) which addresses many common issues. 

### **Machines not showing up in the portal**

* To prevent stale data, machines that have not reported in for 12 hours are not shown in Update Management
* Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs) to check for the most recent reports from machines and common solutions

### **Update Agent Readiness shows "Not Configured" or "Not Assessed"**

* Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs) to check for the most recent reports from machines and common solutions
* If you see an error code like "Exception from HRESULT 0x...", follow the troubleshooting guide for ["Machine shows as Not Assessed and shows an HResult exception"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#hresult)



### **The solution cannot be enabled on this VM because the VM already has the management agent..."**

* This error occurs when a machine is already enrolled into Update Management
* A common cause is when [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/) already manages a machine


### **"No computers match the Update deployment target specification" error received**

* You may see this error if machines are offline when the deployment occurs. Follow the steps in ["Machines don't show up under Update Management" ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/update-management#nologs).
* Review the steps to creating a dynamic deployment, especially the note about permissions, in ["Use Dynamic Groups"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-update-management-groups)

### **"You have requested to create an update configuration on a machine that is not registered for Update Management"**

* This issue is commonly related to Scope Configuration:

  * Option 1) [Update the scope configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account#scope-configuration) to add the desired machines
  * Option 2) (Recommended) [Disable Scope Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-automation-account#all-available-and-future-machines) and register all machines in the workspace for Update Management

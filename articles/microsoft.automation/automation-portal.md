# Azure Automation - Automation Account
The Automation Account is used to host a variety of services, from runbooks to Update Management and Start-Stop VM Solution. This article will help you troubleshoot specific aspects of creating and maintaining an Automation Account.

## **Recommended Steps**

### I want to know what regions Automation Accounts are available in

* This information can be found at [the "Azure Products by Region" page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=automation&regions=all)
* This page also includes information about planned future availability

### I'm having trouble creating an Automation Account

* The most common issues creating an Automation Account are related to permissions. Check ["Permissions required to Create an Automation Account"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account#permissions-required-to-create-an-automation-account)

### I can't create or renew a RunAs account / RunAs is greyed out

* RunAs and Classic RunAs accounts are greyed out when you do not have sufficient permissions
* You might also see the message "You do not have permissions to createâ€¦"
* See the ["Unable to Update or Create RunAs account"section of the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/shared-resources#unable-create-update) 

### Deleting an Automation Account

* If you are trying and failing to delete an Automation Account, please ensure all workspaces are unlinked by following the instructions at ["Unlink a Workspace"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-onboard-solutions-from-browse#unlink-workspace)

# Azure Automation - Problem Deploying Start-Stop Solution
If you are trying to deploy the [Start/Stop VMs solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management), but it isn't working, please refer to the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Start/Stop Solution won't deploy**

* Review the [deployment documentation for Start-Stop VM Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management#deploy-the-solution)
* Try creating a new automation account just for the Start-Stop VM solution to isolate any module conflicts

# Azure Automation - Creating Run As Accounts 
RunAs accounts are used by Azure Automation to help authenticate against Azure resources.

## **Recommended Steps**

In order to manage RunAs accounts, you will need permissions as listed at ["Permissions Required to Manage RunAs Accounts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/manage-runas-account#permissions)

### I can't create or renew a RunAs account / RunAs is greyed out

* RunAs and Classic RunAs accounts are greyed out when you do not have sufficient permissions
* You might also see the message "You do not have permissions to createâ€¦"
* See the ["Unable to Update or Create RunAs account" section of the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/shared-resources#unable-create-update)

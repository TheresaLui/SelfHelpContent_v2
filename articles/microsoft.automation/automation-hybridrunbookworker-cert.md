# Azure Automation - Using Hybrid Runbook Worker with RunAs

## **Recommended Steps**

Many issues with Hybrid Workers are caused by connectivity problems. Run [the "Test Cloud Connectivity" tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows-troubleshoot#connectivity-issues) to ensure your environment is properly configured. 

### Authenticating against Azure Resources from Hybrid Worker

* Runbooks from a hybrid worker behave differently from runbooks in an Azure Automation sandbox. The article ["Runbook Permissions"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-hrw-run-runbooks#runbook-permissions) explains how authentication works for different runbook environments. 


### No certificate was found in the certificate store

* To resolve this issue, follow the ["No Certificate was Found" section of the Hybrid Worker troubleshooter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#no-cert-found)

### Error: "Machine is already registered to a different account"

* Follow the troubleshooting guide for ["Unable to add a Hybrid Runbook Worker"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/hybrid-runbook-worker#already-registered)

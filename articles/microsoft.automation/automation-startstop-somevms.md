# Azure Automation - Some VMs fail to start or stop
Here are some common issues which might cause some, but not all, VMs to start or stop on schedule. If you have an issue where all VMs will not start or stop on schedule, please choose "All VMs fail to start or stop" as your category to see more relevant information.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Some VMs do not start/stop**

* Please refer to the ["Some VMs" section of the Start/Stop VM Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/start-stop-vm#some-vms-fail-to-startstop)

**VM having problem starting / deallocating**

* If after following the [Start/Stop VM Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/troubleshoot/start-stop-vm#some-vms-fail-to-startstop) you have narrowed down the issue to a specific VM, you should open a support ticket under the Virtual Machines topic

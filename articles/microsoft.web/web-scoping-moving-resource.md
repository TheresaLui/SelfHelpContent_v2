# Moving resources
* Are you moving App Service resources within the same subscription or are you trying to move resources across different subscriptions?
* What is the destination resource group?
* What resource(s) are you trying to move? 
* Do any of the apps have SSL certificates configured? If yes, are they custom SSL certificates or Azure App Service Certificates?

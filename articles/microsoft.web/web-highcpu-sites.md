# availability, performance, and application issues/Availability, Performance, and Application Issues/Web app experiencing high CPU

## **Recommended Steps**

To troubleshoot a high CPU issue, we recommend the use of the **“Diagnose and solve problems”** blade and running the CPU analysis. <br>

Here are some examples of CPU intensive operations that applications can perform. These can be resolved by avoiding these general patterns in your application: 
 
* Nested loops with many iterations <br>
* Storing large collections in memory and iterating through them in each request instead of using efficient search algorithms <br>
* Complex math operations, large string manipulations, XML transforms <br>
* Exception handling with retries that attempt the same failing operation repeatedly <br>
* Using large amounts of memory in your application which causes frequent page file swaps <br>
* .NET Garbage Collection (GC) running within the application <br>
* Running multiple CPU intensive applications on the same Application Service Plan which all compete for the same CPU resources

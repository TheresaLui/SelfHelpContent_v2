**Troubleshooting issues with Visual Studio deployments:**<br>
To resolve the most common issues with Visual Studio deployments via Web Deploy, try one or more of the following methods:

1.	Make sure that you have the latest version of the Azure SDK for the version of Visual Studio that you are using: [Download Location.](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads) <br>
2.	If using Deployment credentials, make sure that: <br>
	a. The account is not disabled in Azure Active Directory. <br>
	b. The user account format is correct (User account should NOT be preceded by the web app name NOR by a $). <br>
	c. The password is correct. <br>
For more information see: [Wiki on Deployment Credentials](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-credentials) <br>
3.	If using Publishing credentials make sure that: <br>
	a. You download the most recent publishing profile and that the user name is preceded by $. For more information please review the: [Deployment credentials Wiki](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-credentials).<br>
4.	By default, when deploying to Azure App Service Web Apps, it will try to connect to the SCM site of your Web App (http://<yourWebAppName>.scm.azurewebsites.net). Make sure that Visual Studio is able to connect to it. <br>
5.	If behind a proxy, make sure that Visual Studio is correctly configured to use your proxy server. For more information see: [More info on Proxy Authorization Required Error](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn771556.aspx) <br>

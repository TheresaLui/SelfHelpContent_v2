# Open Source Technologies/ClearDB

ClearDB is a third-party service that provides the ability to use MySQL-as-a-service. In order to better serve their customers, ClearDB will be retiring from Azure Marketplace but will continue to provide their MySQL services outside of Azure Marketplace. We encourage customers to transition to a direct account relationship with ClearDB. <br>

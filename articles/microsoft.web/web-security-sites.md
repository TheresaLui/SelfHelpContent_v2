# Malware, Virus, or Security Intrusion

## **Recommended documents**
There is built-in security scanning that is always enabled: [Microsoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-antimalware).<br>

For Azure App Service, it only protects the App Service infrastructure.  There is no reporting as you, as a customer, have no way to access the infrastructure due to sandboxing. If we find a problem, we handle it transparently for you.<br>
 
Tinfoil is a premium service you can use to scan the content of your site: [read more](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/web-vulnerability-scanning-for-azure-app-service-powered-by-tinfoil-security/).

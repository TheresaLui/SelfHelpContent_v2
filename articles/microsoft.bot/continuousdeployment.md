# Troubleshoot continuous deployment

## **Recommended Steps**
​
### **Getting continuous deployment working​**
* Your bot must be deployed to Azure and you must have a App Service to be able to configure continuous deployment.​
* Ensure your repository has the [correct files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-build-continuous-deployment?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#prepare-your-repository).​
* Ensure your repository is working as expected. ​
  * Using Azure DevOps or GitHub, your repository will have a .git folder and at least one branch.​
* Ensure logged in and shows correct account/org​
* If you are not seeing any values in drop-downs (org/repo/branch) when configuring your connection, refresh the browser.​
​
### **Application no longer deploying​**
* Check for errors showing in the App Service's Deployment Center​
  * If so, review to understand what is now failing​
* Check to make sure the remote repository is still available ​
* Go to Deployment Center underneath App Service​
* Click on the Repository link to have the repository open in another tab and ensure it is the correct one​
* Click on sync button to attempt a new synchronization. ​
* To isolate where the issue might be, you may consider creating a new App Service and configure deployment from there.​
* If that works, then it is an issue with the Configuration within the initial App Service. ​
 * Follow directions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-build-continuous-deployment?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#disable-continuous-deployment) to disconnect and disable Continuous Deployment​
 * Reconnect to repository to [reenable continous deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-build-continuous-deployment?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#continuous-deployment-using-github).​

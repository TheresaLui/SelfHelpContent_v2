# Bot Framework SDK Migration

## **Recommended Steps**

The Bot Framework SDK v4 builds on the customers' feedback and learning experience from previous SDKs. The new version introduces the right levels of abstraction while enabling a flexible architecture of the bot components. This, for example, allows you to create a simple bot and then expand it in sophistication using the modularity and extensibility of the Bot Framework SDK v4.The Bot Framework SDK v4 supports the same underlying Bot Framework Service as v3. However, v4 is a refactoring of the previous SDKs to allow more flexibility and control over a bot's creation.

Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements. As announced previously, the V3 SDK is being retired. Accordingly, there will be no more development in V3 repositories. Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads.

As mentioned, Bot Builder SDK V3 bots continue to run and be supported by Azure Bot Service. Bot Builder SDK V3 will only be supported for critical security bug fixes, connector, and protocol layer compatibility updates. All new features and capabilities are developed exclusively on Bot Framework SDK V4.

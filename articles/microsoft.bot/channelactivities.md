# I have a problem sending an activity to a channel

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check that the activity type, feature, etc., is supported by the channel it is being sent to. While the Bot Framework may support sending a particular kind of activity (e.g. an adaptive card), some channels may not support receiving them.
* Check that the activity is properly addressed. Message activities sent are usually in response to a message received first, therefore addressing is taken from the inbound activity. Messages sent that are **not** in response to an already received inbound message require a proper *conversational reference* and details about the sender and receiver [[schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/botframework-schema/conversationreference?view=botbuilder-ts-latest), for reference].
* If the issue is related to messaging order, there is no guarantee provided. The Bot Framework attempts to preserve messaging order, however this is channel-specific. The channel is primarily responsible for message delivery and may reorder messages.

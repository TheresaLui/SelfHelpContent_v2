# Configure application insights for Bot SDK code

You can enable Application Insights functionality for your bot (App Service) running in Azure, just as you would for other App Services. 

## **Recommended Steps**

Go to your App Service's settings, then to Application Insights. Select `Turn on Application Insights` to enable it. If not created, you have the option to link or create an Application Insights resource. If the App Service (Web App) was created from a **Web App Bot** you *can* use the existing Application Insights resource (already linked to the **Bot Channels Registration**) by clicking on `Turn on Application Insights`.

To fully utilize the Application Insights telemetry and exception logging, you will need to make sure to utilize the appropriate features and functionality from the articles below.

## **Recommended Documents**

- [Sample: CoreBot with Application Insights](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/21.corebot-app-insights/README.md)

Make sure to confirm if this information is accurate on the Health tab inside Resource Explorer. 

1. If you find the RCA for the customer issue in Insights results and it describes the customer issue well, please provide the RCA from the Insight to the customer. 
2. If the description doesn't logically match the customer situation or it doesn't have enough information or no information to provide it to the customer, then select "No" below.
3. If the customer is not satisfied with the shared RCA and wants us to provide more details about the issue and the RCA initially provided, please select "No" below.

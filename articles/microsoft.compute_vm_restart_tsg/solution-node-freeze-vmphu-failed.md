# Node Freeze due to VMPHU updates
<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM Virtual machine became unavailable at StartTime (UTC) and availability was restored at EndTime (UTC). This unexpected occurrence was caused by an Azure initiated memory-preserving update action.
The memory-preserving update action was performed on the physical node where the virtual machine was hosted. During this update the VM rebooted unexpectedly due to a platform bug. RDP connections to the VM, or requests to any other services running inside the VM may have failed during this time.
Our core platform engineers have identified the bug and are currently working on a fix for this issue. Once the solution has been verified and completed testing, it will be deployed to all affected nodes.  At the moment, we do not have a timeline for the fix to be deployed.

To learn more about our memory-preserving updates, please refer to the articles below.

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, it is recommended that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. To learn more about high availability options, please refer to the articles below.

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal.To learn more about Azure Resource Health, please refer to the Understand and use Resource Health Center to troubleshoot this scenario in the future.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working on improving the platform to reduce the availability incidents of Virtual Machines due to platform issue.

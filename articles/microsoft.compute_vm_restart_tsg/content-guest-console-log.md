# How to collect guest OS logs

* Validate if Guest OS logs should be collected (prerequisites: no logs already collected and approval from the customer to collect the GuestOS Logs
* The following types of logs should be collected: Console Log, WinGuestAnalyzer and InspectIaaSDisk log

>Even if running HA or collecting the Guest OS logs might be necessary at a later moment, please keep in mind that our data/log retention policy, from platform side, can be very short. Hence, our recommendation is to collect both HA and Guest OS logs at the sooner.

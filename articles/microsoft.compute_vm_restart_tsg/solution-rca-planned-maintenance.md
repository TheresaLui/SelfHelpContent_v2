# RCA for Planned Maintenance
<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your VM Virtual machine became unavailable at StartTime (UTC) and availability was restored at EndTime (UTC). This expected occurrence was caused by an Azure initiated planned maintenance action.
This planned maintenance update required a reboot of your virtual machines to apply the required updates to the infrastructure. The virtual machine was shut down while we patched the infrastructure, and then the virtual machine was restarted. To learn more about planned maintenance on Azure, please refer to the articles below.

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, it is recommended that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. To learn more about high availability options, please refer to the articles below.

Microsoft Azure also provides access to resource health and troubleshooting information in the Azure Portal. To learn more about Azure Resource Health, please refer to the Understand and use Resource Health Center to troubleshoot this scenario in the future.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working on improving the platform to reduce the availability incidents of Virtual Machines due to platform issue.

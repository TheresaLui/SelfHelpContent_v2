# Connectivity 502 Error

502 Bad Gateway error can happen due to various reasons. Most commonly, it could be one of the following:

* Backend servers failing to respond to health probes or response status code or body mismatch from what is configured
* Certificate mismatch for End-to-End SSL scenario, which may lead to probe failures
* Backend servers timing out for requests sent from Application Gateway
* Request being sent to an empty backend pool
* A basic rule has been listed on top of the multi-site rules which catches all the requests and routes them to unintended backend pool

You can troubleshoot the issue using the [guided troubleshooting document](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4504111/azure-application-gateway-with-bad-gateway-502-errors) or going through the recommended documentation for more details.

You are creating a case for [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview), which is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. In order to handle your inquiry in the most efficient way, we recommend you to visit our FAQ [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq) which provides more insights and explains how Azure Firewall is different from services such as [NVAs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#how-does-azure-firewall-work-differently-from-existing-services-such-as-nvas-in-the-marketplace), [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-application-gateway-waf-and-azure-firewall), and [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-network-security-groups-nsgs-and-azure-firewall).

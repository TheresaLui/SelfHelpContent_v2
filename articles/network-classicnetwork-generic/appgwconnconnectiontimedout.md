# Connectivity Connection Timed out

Connection timed out error when accessing Application Gateway usually occurs when the client could not establish a TCP/SSL session with the Application Gateway on the requested port due to either a listener not being configured, NSG/UDR blocking the access to the port or the domain name with which you are accessing not resolving to Application Gateway's IP address.

Check the documentation mentioned below to get guidance on how to troubleshoot these issues.

## **Recommended Documents**

* NSG or UDR could be blocking access to the ports. Check the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#network-security-groups-on-the-application-gateway-subnet) to understand the NSG requirements apart from allowing inbound access to the required ports.
* If there is no listener configured on the requested frontend port, follow the [documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-overview#network-security-groups-on-the-application-gateway-subnet) to configure one and start accepting traffic.

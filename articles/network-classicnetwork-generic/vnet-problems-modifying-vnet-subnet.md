# Azure Virtual Network - Problems modifying a VNet or Subnet

## **Recommended Steps**

Change a VNet IP range:

1. Add a [new address space](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#add-or-remove-an-address-range) in the virtual network (VNet) which doesn't overlap with on-premises ranges or VNet ranges that you want to peer with.
2. Turn **off** all of the virtual machines (VMs) in the VNet that include the new address space.
3. Navigate to each network interface (NIC) and [change the NIC subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface#change-subnet-assignment) from the old subnet to the newly added subnet.
4. Remove any other resources from the original address range, such as, [private endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview), [subnet delegations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation#remove-subnet-delegation-from-an-azure-service) to other services, and [VNet integrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet#manage-vnet-integration).
5. After you change the NICs to newly created subnets, [delete the original address space](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#add-or-remove-an-address-range).

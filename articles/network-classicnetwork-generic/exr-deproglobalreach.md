# De-provisioning Issues

## Connectivity to Azure Private, Azure Public, or Dynamics 365 Services

You can delete your ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the delete icon. Please note the following information:

* You must unlink all virtual networks from the ExpressRoute circuit.
* You or your service provider must delete all the BGP Peerings on the circuit.
* If the ExpressRoute circuit service provider provisioning state is Provisioning or Provisioned, you must work with your service provider to de-provision the circuit on their side.
* If the service provider has de-provisioned the circuit (the service provider provisioning state is set to **Not Provisioned**), you can delete the circuit. This stops billing for the circuit.

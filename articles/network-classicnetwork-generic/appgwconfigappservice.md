# Configure Application Gateway with App Service
Application gateway provides a capability which allows users to override the HTTP host header in the request based on the host name of the back-end. 

This capability enables support for multi-tenant back ends such as Azure App service web apps and API management. This capability is available for both the v1 and v2 standard and WAF SKUs.

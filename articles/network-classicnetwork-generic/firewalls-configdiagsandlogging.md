# Diagnostics and logging

You are creating a case for [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview), which is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. In order to handle your inquiry in the most efficient way, we recommend you to visit our FAQ [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq) which provides more insight and explains how Azure Firewall is different from services such as [NVAs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#how-does-azure-firewall-work-differently-from-existing-services-such-as-nvas-in-the-marketplace), [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-application-gateway-waf-and-azure-firewall), and [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-network-security-groups-nsgs-and-azure-firewall).

## **Recommended Documents**

* Monitor Azure Firewall using [diagnostics and logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/tutorial-diagnostics). You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources. Using metrics, you can view performance counters in the portal.<br>
* Use [Log Analytics Samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/log-analytics-samples) to analyze Azure Firewall logs

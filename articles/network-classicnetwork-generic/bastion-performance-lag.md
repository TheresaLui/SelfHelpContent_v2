# Have a lag while using my RDP or SSH session

## **Recommended Steps**

You may be using large number of RDP sessions on your Azure Bastion service. During public preview, only 25 concurrent sessions per deployment is supported. With General Availability, you will have the option to scale your Azure Bastion deployment based on your capacity needs.

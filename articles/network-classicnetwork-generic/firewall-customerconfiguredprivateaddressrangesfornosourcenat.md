# Customer configured Private Address Ranges for No Source NAT

## **Recommended Steps**

Azure firewall provides automatic Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for all outbound traffic to public IP addresses. Azure Firewall doesnâ€™t SNAT when the destination IP address is a private IP address range per IANA RFC 1918. If your organization uses a public IP address range for private networks or opts to force tunnel Azure Firewall internet traffic via an on-premises firewall, you can configure Azure Firewall to not SNAT additional custom IP address ranges. For more information, see [Azure Firewall SNAT private IP address ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

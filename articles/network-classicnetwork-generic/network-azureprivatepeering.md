# Connectivity/Azure Private Peering
ARP entries can help validate Layer 2 configuration, and to troubleshoot basic layer 2 connectivity issues.  These documents describe how to verify ARP entries based on the deployment model:<br>
* [Verify ARP entries in the Resource Manager Deployment Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-arp-resource-manager)<br>
* [Verify ARP entries in the Classic Deployment Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-arp-classic)<br>
* Check if there is only only one entry in the ARP table, or the on-premise MAC address shows 'incomplete'.  Often these are indicators of issues on either side of the connection.  If you encounter any of these issues, open a support request with your connectivity provider.<br>

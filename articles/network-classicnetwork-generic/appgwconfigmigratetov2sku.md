# Migrate from V1 to V2 SKU

Application Gateway V2 SKU offers additional features such as autoscaling, availability-zone redundancy, header rewrite, etc. However, existing v1 gateways aren't automatically upgraded to v2. If you want to migrate from v1 to v2, you can follow the steps in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/migrate-v1-v2).

If the script fails to run due to any error, try running it again for a few times. If it doesn't succeed, you can raise a support ticket for further investigation or send an email to appgwmigrationsup@microsoft.com or do both, with the error message and the required information.

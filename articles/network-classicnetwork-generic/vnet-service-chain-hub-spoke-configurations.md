# Azure Virtual Network - Service Chain with Hub-and-Spoke configurations

## **Recommended Steps**

Completing a Service Chain in a hub and spoke topology within Azure requires the following steps:

1. Use a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in the Hub VNet. [Set up an NVA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-create-route-table-portal#create-an-nva).

2. There must be [user-defined routes (UDRs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-create-route-table-portal#create-a-route-table) in the spoke VNets with the next hop type of **Network Virtual Appliance** pointing to the internet protocol (IP) address of the NVA in the hub virtual network (VNet)

3. NVA network interfaces (NICs) must have ['IP Forwarding' enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-create-route-table-portal#turn-on-ip-forwarding)

4. NVAs must be configured correctly internally, which requires NVA vendor assistance. For point-to-site clients connecting with resources, in a remote VNet that is peered with the point-to-site VPN VNet, ensure the following:

  - The **use remote gateway** option is selected for the spoke VNet that doesn't have a VPN gateway. You won't be able to enable this if your spoke VNet has a gateway by-design.
  - The **allow gateway transit** option must be enabled on the hub VNet that has the point-to-site VPN gateway.
  - The point-to-site package must be downloaded and installed again **after** VNet Peering has been established or changed for the point-to-site package to have the updated routes.

# Configuration and Setup/Setup NPM for ExpressRoute

Network Performance Monitor (NPM) is a cloud-based network monitoring solution that monitors connectivity between Azure cloud deployments and on-premises locations (Branch offices, etc.). NPM is part of Azure Monitor logs. NPM offers an extension for ExpressRoute that lets you monitor network performance over ExpressRoute circuits that are configured to use private peering or Microsoft peering. When you configure NPM for ExpressRoute, you can detect network issues to identify and eliminate. This service is also available for Azure Government Cloud.

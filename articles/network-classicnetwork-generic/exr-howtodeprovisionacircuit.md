# managment/how to de-provision a circuit
## **Recommended steps**
You can delete your ExpressRoute circuit by selecting the delete icon. Note the following information:<br>
1. You must unlink all virtual networks from the ExpressRoute circuit.<br>
2. If the ExpressRoute circuit service provider provisioning state is Provisioning or Provisioned you must work with your service provider to deprovision the circuit on their side.<br>
3. If the service provider has deprovisioned the circuit (the service provider provisioning state is set to Not provisioned), you can delete the circuit. This stops billing for the circuit.

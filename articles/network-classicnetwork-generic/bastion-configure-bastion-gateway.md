# Configure Bastion gateway

## **Recommended Steps**
### **How do I handle deployment failures?**
Deployment failures may result from a [limit on the number of public IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) allowed per subscription that causes the Azure Bastion deployment to fail. To resolve this issue delete any unused or unnecessary public IP addresses and deploy again. If you continue to have issues [raise a support request in the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request) as needed.

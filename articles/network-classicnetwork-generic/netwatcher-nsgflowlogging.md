# Common issues with NSG Flow Logs

## **Recommended Steps**

### I could not enable NSG Flow Logs

* "Microsoft.Insights" resource provider is not registered

If you received an *AuthorizationFailed* or a *GatewayAuthenticationFailed* error, you might have not enabled the Microsoft Insights resource provider on your subscription. Please [follow the instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal#register-insights-provider) to enable the Microsoft Insights provider.

### I have enabled NSG Flow Logs but do not see data in my storage account

* **Service Endpoints exist on your VNet**

NSG Flow Logs does not work on NSGs with [Service endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) enabled. If you had Service Endpoints on your Vnet or have recently added one, NSG Flow Log data will stop being captured.

There are two ways to fix this:

1.  Re-configure NSG flow logs to emit to Azure Storage account without VNET endpoints

* Find subnets with endpoints:

	- On the Azure portal, search for **Resource Groups** in the global search at the top
	- Navigate to the Resource Group containing the NSG you are working with
	- Use the 2nd dropdown to filter by type and select **Virtual Networks**
	- Click on the Virtual Network containing the Service Endpoints
	- Select **Service endpoints** under **Settings** from the left pane
	- Make a note of the subnets where **Microsoft.Storage** is enabled

* Disabling service endpoints:

	- Continuing from above, select **Subnets** under **Settings** from the left pane
	* Click on the subnet containing the Service Endpoints
	- In the **Service endpoints** section, under **Services**, uncheck **Microsoft.Storage**

You can check the storage logs after a few minutes, you should see an updated TimeStamp or a new JSON file created.

* **Disable NSG flow logs**

If the Microsoft.Storage service endpoints are a must, you will have to disable NSG Flow Logs.

* **Storage account is behind a firewall**

NSG Flow Logs cannot write to storage accounts behind a firewall. This issue is resolved by allowing "All networks" to access the storage account:

* Find the name of the storage account by locating the NSG on the [NSG Flow Logs overview page](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Network/NetworkWatcherMenuBlade/flowLogs)
* Navigate to the storage account by typing the storage account's name in the global search on the portal
* Under the **SETTINGS** section, select **Firewalls and virtual networks**
* Select **All networks** and save it. If it is already selected, no change is needed.

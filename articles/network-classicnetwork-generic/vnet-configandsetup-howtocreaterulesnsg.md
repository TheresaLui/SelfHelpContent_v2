[Azure Network Watcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

## **Recommended steps**
1. Organize you network resources with [Network Security Groups (NSGs).](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).
2. Filter traffic coming in and out of your NSG with [Security Rules.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#security-rules) on your NSGs.
3. View the Security Rules applied to a an existing Virtual Machine with [Effective Security Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-security-group-view-overview).
4. Log all the traffic going in and out of your NSG with [NSG Flow Logs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview).
5. Capture traffic on individuals Virtual Machines with [Packet Capture.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-packet-capture-overview).

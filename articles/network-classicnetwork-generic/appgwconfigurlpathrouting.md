# Configure URL Path-Based Routing

URL Path Based Routing allows you to route traffic to back-end server pools based on URL Paths of the request. For example, it can be configured so where requests to Application Gateway with path "/images" can be routed to backend pool A and requests with path "/videos" can be routed to backend pool B.

# Configure network rules

You are creating a case for [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview), which is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. In order to handle your inquiry in the most efficient way, we recommend you to visit our FAQ [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq) which provides more insight and explains how Azure Firewall is different from services such as [NVAs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#how-does-azure-firewall-work-differently-from-existing-services-such-as-nvas-in-the-marketplace), [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-application-gateway-waf-and-azure-firewall), and [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/firewall-faq#what-is-the-difference-between-network-security-groups-nsgs-and-azure-firewall).

## **Recommended Documents**

* Configure [Application rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal#configure-application-rules) or [Network rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal#configure-network-rules) to control outbound access<br>
* Deploy and configure [Azure Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal#create-a-default-route)<br>
* Use [FQDN tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags) in application rules to allow outbound network traffic through your firewall<br>
* Learn about built-in rule collection for [Infrastructure FQDNs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/infrastructure-fqdns) that are allowed by default<br>
* Azure Firewall has NAT rules, network rules, and application rules. Understand how [rule processing logic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/rule-processing) works in Azure Firewall.

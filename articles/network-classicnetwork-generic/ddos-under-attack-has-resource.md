# I'm under attack

## **Recommended Steps**

You have selected a problem of **I'm under attack**. 

If you do not have a DDoS Protection Standard plan, we recommend that you onboard to Azure DDoS Protection Standard, which offers enhanced mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks. 

Otherwise, proceed to file a support ticket if:

- During a DDoS attack you find that the performance of the protected resource is severely degraded or the resource is unavailable.
- You think your resource is under DDoS attack, but DDoS Protection service is not mitigating the attack effectively.
- You're planning a viral event that will significantly increase your network traffic.
- The attack has a critical business impact.

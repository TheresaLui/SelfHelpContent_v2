# Diagnose and resolve Site-to-Site VPN connectivity issues <Internal>
## Troubleshoot Site-to-Site VPN connectivity issues
:::Section VPN connectivity:::

A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection connects your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. 

Insights from the the following diagnostics can help you troubleshoot most Site-to-Site VPN connectivity issues. If diagnostics donâ€™t detect an issue, the following recommended steps and documents can help you troubleshoot further.

## Recommended steps

1. [VPN Gateway reset](data-blade:microsoft_azure_network.VirtualNetworkGatewayResetBlade) can help if you lost cross-premises VPN connectivity on one or more site-to-site VPN tunnels<br>
2. Troubleshoot on-premises connectivity issues by using [VPN diagnostics](data-blade:microsoft_azure_network.networkwatchervpndiagnosticsblade.id.$resourceId)<br>
3. Review the VPN logs (available in the storage account) to find any issues with the VPN tunnel or configuration of devices<br>
4. Use [packet capture](data-blade:microsoft_azure_network.networkwatcherpacketcaptureblade) to track traffic to and from the VM<br>
5. Check if you've configured UDRs or NSGs that may be affecting the connectivity

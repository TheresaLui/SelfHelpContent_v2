# How to configure ExpressRoute and site-to-site coexisting connections
## **Recommended documents**

Configuring Site-to-Site VPN and ExpressRoute coexisting connections has several advantages:<br>

* You can configure a Site-to-Site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute.<br>
* Alternatively, you can use Site-to-Site VPNs to connect to sites that are not connected through ExpressRoute.<br> 

You can follow [step by step instructions to configure these scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-coexist-resource-manager).

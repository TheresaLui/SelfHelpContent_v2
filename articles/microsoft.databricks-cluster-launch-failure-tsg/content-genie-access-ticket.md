# Check if a genie access ticket has been created

Genie tool is an application that with customer permission allows CSS to access:

1.	Customers workspace
2.	Databricks control plane logs 
3.	Customers spark logs

Check in the case that the **DatabricksConsent**  is **True**. This gives Microsoft and Databricks permissions to access customers workspace and logs.

**Important**: If DatabricksConsent is False, please get customer written or verbal consent before accessing Genie.

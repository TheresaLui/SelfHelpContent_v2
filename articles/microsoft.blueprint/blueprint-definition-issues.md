# Azure Blueprints - Other blueprint definition issues

Most users are able to resolve their blueprint definition issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Blueprint definitions only support a limited set of functions. Only a small set of ARM Template functions are supported in the blueprint definition. You can still use ARM Template functions inside of an ARM Template artifact. [View the full list of Blueprint functions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/reference/blueprint-functions).
* Blueprint definitions must be published with a distinct version before they can be assigned to a subscription. [Follow the Blueprints Portal QuickStart for a detailed walk through](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal).
* Blueprints can be assigned via [Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal), [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-powershell), or [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-rest-api). PowerShell assignment supports a parameters file to avoid manually filling out a long list of parameters in the portal.

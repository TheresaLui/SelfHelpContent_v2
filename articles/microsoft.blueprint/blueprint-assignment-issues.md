# Azure Blueprints - Blueprint assignment basics

Most users are able to resolve their blueprint assignment issue using the steps below

## **Recommended Steps**

**Is your assignment failing unexpectedly?**

* If it is an `Azure Resource Manager Template` artifact, it may not necessarily be a blueprint issue. Consider checking the [ARM template documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/)
* If it is a permissions issue, make sure the managed identity you are using has the right permissions. The `System Assigned` managed identity will only have permissions on the assigned subscription. [Learn more about the blueprint lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/concepts/deployment-stages#the-blueprint-assignment-object-is-created).

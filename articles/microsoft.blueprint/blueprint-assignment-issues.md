# Azure Blueprints - Other blueprint assignment issues

Most users are able to resolve their blueprint assignment issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If your issue is with an `Azure Resource Manager Template` artifact, it may not necessarily be a blueprint issue. Consider checking the [ARM template documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/).
* If it is a permissions issue, make sure the managed identity you are using has the right permissions. The `System Assigned` managed identity will only have permissions on the assigned subscription. [Learn more about the blueprint lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/concepts/deployment-stages#the-blueprint-assignment-object-is-created).
* If you need to view the blueprint in more depth, you can export the full JSON of the blueprint definition.
  * [Export via PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/import-export-ps)
  * [Export via REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/blueprints/blueprints/get)

### Other possible issues

* Blueprint assignments cannot be cancelled. They will timeout after six hours. With very few exceptions, most assignments should not take this long to deploy.
* Deleting a blueprint assignment will **not** remove the resources that it provisioned. Resources created by the blueprint assignment need to be cleaned up manually.

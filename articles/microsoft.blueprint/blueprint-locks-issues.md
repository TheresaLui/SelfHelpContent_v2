# Azure Blueprints - Blueprint lock issues 

## **Recommended Steps**

* The `managed identity` you choose will automatically get an exemption to the blueprint lock so that it can continue to manage resources in the blueprint
* You can exempt up to four additional principals from the blueprint lock with the `excludedPrincipals` property. [Learn how to exempt principals from a blueprint assignment here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/concepts/resource-locking#exclude-a-principal-from-a-deny-assignment)
* You can exempt specific actions with the `excludedActions` property. For example, even with a `ReadOnly` lock, you may still want to allow for a VM restart action.

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
## **Role Recycle incident diagnostic information** ##

Your role **<!--$RoleName-->RoleName<!--/$RoleName-->** availability has been affected from **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**  to **<!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**.  The instance **<!--$ListRoleInstanceName-->ListRoleInstanceName<!--/$ListRoleInstanceName-->**  was/were down during this time frame. This expected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated planned maintenance action.**  

<!--/issueDescription-->

This planned maintenance update required a reimage of your Role Instance to apply the required updates to the infrastructure. The Role Instance was shut down while we patched the infrastructure, and then the Role Instance was restarted. Please note that during this patching activity while we preserve the Local Resource disk (usually C:), the Windows disk (usually D:) gets rebuilt. So if you have stored any files on Windows disk that will get deleted during this reimage.<br> To learn more about disk partition preservation, please refer to the following article:<br>

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, it is recommended that you have two or more instance for each of your Web\Worker Role.<br>

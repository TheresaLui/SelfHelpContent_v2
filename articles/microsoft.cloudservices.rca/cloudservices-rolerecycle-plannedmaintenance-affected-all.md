# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
Our logs show that **<!--$ListRoleInstanceName-->ListRoleInstanceName<!--/$ListRoleInstanceName-->** of your Cloud Service role **<!--$RoleName-->RoleName<!--/$RoleName-->**, was unavailable from **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**  to **<!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**. This downtime was due to a planned maintenance action initiated by the Azure platform.
<!--/issueDescription-->

This planned maintenance update required a reimage of your role instance to apply required updates to the Azure infrastructure. The role instance was shut down while we patched the infrastructure, and then restarted once the patching was complete. Please note that during this patching activity, while we preserve the local resource disk, (usually C:), the Windows disk (usually D:) gets rebuilt. If you have stored any files on the Windows disk, they will get deleted during this reimage.

To ensure an increased level of protection and redundancy for your application in Azure, it is recommended that you have two or more instances for each of your web/worker roles.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We are continuously working on improving the Azure platform to increase the availability of your Cloud Services.

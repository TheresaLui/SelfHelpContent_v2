<!--issueDescription-->
## **Role Recycle incident diagnostic information** ##

Your role **<!--$RoleName-->RoleName<!--/$rolename-->** availability has been partially affected from **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**  to **<!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> (UTC)**.  The instance **<!--$ListRoleInstanceName-->ListRoleInstanceName<!--/$ListRoleInstanceName-->**  was/were down during this time frame. This expected occurrence was caused by an **Azure initiated planned maintenance action.**  

<!--/issueDescription-->

This planned maintenance update required a reboot of your Role Instance to apply the required updates to the infrastructure. The Role Instance was shut down while we patched the infrastructure, and then the Role Instance was restarted. Please note that during this patching activity we preserve the disks on your VM, so you should not have any data loss.<br> To learn more about disk partition preservation, please refer to the following article:<br>

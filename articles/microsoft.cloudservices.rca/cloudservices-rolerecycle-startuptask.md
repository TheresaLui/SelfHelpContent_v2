# Cloud service role is continually recycling
<!--issueDescription-->

## **Role Recycle incident diagnostic information** ##

We attempted to start **<!--$ListRoleInstanceName-->ListRoleInstanceName<!--/$ListRoleInstanceName-->** instance of your Cloud Service role **<!--$RoleName-->RoleName<!--/$RoleName-->** at **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> (UTC)**  and it failed to start.
We ran diagnostics on your resource and found that the **Startup task <!--$StartupTaskName-->StartupTaskName<!--/$StartupTaskName--> is exiting with non-zero error level** which is blocking the role to be in ready state.

<!--/issueDescription-->
Startup tasks are actions taken before your roles begin and are defined in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file by using the \<Task\> element within the \<Startup\> element. Startup tasks must end with an errorlevel (or exit code) of zero for the startup process to complete. If a startup task ends with a non-zero errorlevel, the role will not start.<br>

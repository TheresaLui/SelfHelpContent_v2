# My subscription is disabled

## **Recommended steps**

* [Find out who's the Account admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)

* You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month. Remove the spending limit to reactive your subscription.<br>
[Learn more about Spending Limit and how to remove it](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/)

* A payment may be past due.<br>
[Address past due balance](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance/)

* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can reactivate it in the Azure Account Center. <br>

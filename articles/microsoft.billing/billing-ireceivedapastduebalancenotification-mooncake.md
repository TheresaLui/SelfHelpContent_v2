# I received a past due balance notification

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Find your Account Admin](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Billing.SubscriptionPropertiesBlade)

If the bill notice was not received because the Account Admin has left the company or changed roles, please open a [support request](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Support.NewSupportRequestBlade) so we can resolve the issue.

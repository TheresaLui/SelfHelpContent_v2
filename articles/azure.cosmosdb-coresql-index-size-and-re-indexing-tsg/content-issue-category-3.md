# Issue Category

* **Not able to update the default indexing policy on a restored collection:**
<br>There is a *_self* parameter which is not getting updated with the new *collectionid*. This can happen while the new collection is getting created.  Once the collection create has succeeded, the _self tag would be populated.

* **Saving changes to my indexing policy in portal appear to do nothing:**
<br>The properties *kind*, *dataType*, and *precision* are no longer necessary to explicitly set and you can omit them from your indexing policy. [Indexing policy examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-manage-indexing-policy#indexing-policy-examples)  

* **Slow Performance Issues:**
<br>Ensure all JSON paths used in queries are included in the index policy for faster reads
<br>Exclude paths not used in queries for more performant writes

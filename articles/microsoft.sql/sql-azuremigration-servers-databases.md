# Migrating between servers or subscriptions, or to and from Azure

## **Recommended steps**
The following details explain how to migrate or move database.

* Move a database to a different server in the same subscription.<br>
Click "Copy" at the top of the SQL database resource blade.
* Move the logical server between subscriptions. Note: Database cannot be moved between subscriptions directly.<br>
Click "Move" at the top of the SQL server resource blade that hosts your database, then pick resources to move and the subscription to move to.
* To migrate an existing SQL database to Azure, first run the compatibility tool to determine whether it can be migrated, fix any incompatibility issues and then select an appropriate migration method.<br>

* Create a copy of a database so it can be used outside of Azure.<br>

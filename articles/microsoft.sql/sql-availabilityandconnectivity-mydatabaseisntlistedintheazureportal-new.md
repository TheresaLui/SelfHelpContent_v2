# availability and connectivity/My database isn't listed in the Azure portal

## **Recommended steps**

Try connecting to your server/database using one of the client tool(s) (SQL Management Studio , Visual Studio, or Other) <br>

### If database is unreachable<br>
* To find out who dropped the database please use operation logs and then [recover your database from backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-recovery-using-backups/).<br>

### If database is accessible<br>
* Open a support ticket for this problem.

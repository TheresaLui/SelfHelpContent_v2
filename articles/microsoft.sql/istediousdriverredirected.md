# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
 We’ve detected a possible issue with your driver’s implementation of TDS routing protocol. This could be leading it to look for the database in an old location. In the immediate, bypassing redirection by forcing your connection policy to Proxy will restore your connectivity. In the future, please consider upgrading your driver to prevent these issues.

# How to improve and debug performance

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve the most common performance issues, try the following methods.

1. [Scaling SQL Data Warehouse (DWU)(https://docs.azure.cn/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview/) up and down is easy, and can provide a short burst of compute or a prolonged increase of performance. If you are just starting out or have recently increased the amount of data you are working with, we recommend trying a few DWU settings to understand which is right for you.
2. Scaling your SQL Data Warehouse can impact concurrency. Learn how you can manage concurrency with [Resource Classes](https://docs.azure.cn/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-develop-concurrency/).
3. Review our [SQL Data Warehouse Best Practices](https://docs.azure.cn/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-best-practices/), which gives several tips on getting your instance running smoothly and quickly.<br>

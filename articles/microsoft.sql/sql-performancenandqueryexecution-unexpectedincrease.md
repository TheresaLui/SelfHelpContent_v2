## **Recommended documents**

* Descriptions of what happens when a database resource limit is reached for compute, storage, and sessions/workers limits, as well as corresponding mitigation steps can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-resource-limits-database-server#what-happens-when-database-resource-limits-are-reached?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630459/). 
* [Query Performance Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-query-performance?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630459/) can be used to easily monitor resource usage in your Azure SQL database (single or pooled database) by using build-in monitoring capabilities in the Azure portal. <br>

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
This issue occurs in a GeoDR relationship between largely different SLOs of Geo-Primary vs. Geo-Secondary. The log was held up by the redo lagging on the Geo-Secondaries instead of the active transaction. For example, a Premium database has multiple replicas. The logs generated by the Geo-Primary are replicated to Geo-Secondaries and are redone/replayed on the Geo-Secondaries.

Geo-Primary cannot truncate a log record until it has been redone on the all the Geo-Secondaries. We enabled parallel redo feature to speed up redo, and in most cases, redo on the Geo-Secondaries should be able to keep up with primary. However, in rare cases, the redo work on the Geo-Secondary's end has be to serialized and this may cause redo lagging when the log generation rate on the primary is very high. This may force availability issue until the logs have been caught up.

Our product team is actively working on the redo improvements to minimize the redo lagging issues caused by mismatched SLOs.

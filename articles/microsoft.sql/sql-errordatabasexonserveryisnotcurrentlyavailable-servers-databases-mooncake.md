# Error: Database 'x' on server 'y' is not currently available

## **Recommended Steps**

The "unable to connect" message (error code 40613) occurs when the Azure SQL Database has been moved because of deployment, failover, or load balancing. This is a transient connectivity issue because reconfigurations are generally expected to complete in less than 60 seconds.

* Applications that are connecting to cloud services should be coded to catch periodic connection errors (e.g., 40613) and should implement [retry logic for transient errors](https://docs.azure.cn/sql-database/sql-database-connectivity-issues/#retry-logic-for-transient-errors).

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Troubleshoot "Database x on server y is not currently available. Please retry the connection later." error](https://docs.azure.cn/sql-database/sql-database-troubleshoot-connection)

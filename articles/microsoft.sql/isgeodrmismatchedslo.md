<!--issueDescription-->
Geo Replication feature leverages SQL Server to asynchronously replicate committed transactions on the primary database to a secondary database. In a Geo Replication environment, both Geo-Primary and Geo-Secondary replicas are ideally required to have same service tier, with same or varying compute size (DTUs & vCores).
<!--/issueDescription-->

It's highly recommended that the Geo-Secondary replicas be created with the same compute size as the Geo-Primary. A Geo-Secondary with lower compute size is at risk of an increased replication and redo lag, potential unavailability and consequently at risk of substantial data loss after a geo failover. In this case, the service level objectives between the Geo-Primary and the Geo-Secondary database are largely different. The log was held up by the redo lagging on the Geo-Secondary instead of the active transaction. The logs generated by the Geo-Primary are replicated to Geo-Secondaries and are redone/replayed on the Geo-Secondaries.

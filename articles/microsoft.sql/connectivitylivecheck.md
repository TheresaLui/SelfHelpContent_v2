The issue you are experiencing could also be a network-related problem at your end.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Try connecting to the database using a different machine to help eliminate the possibility of it being a machine-specific issue
* Connect to the database from a different network to resolve if this is network-related
* Try connecting to the database from a different client
* Check if DNS name resolves correctly with `nslookup`
* Check if packets are not being dropped with PsPing
* For network packet tracing, use NetMon
* Contact your network adminstrator to further investigate the issue at your end

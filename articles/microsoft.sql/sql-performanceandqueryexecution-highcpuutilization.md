# Resolve poor performance and timeout issues in Azure SQL Database

There are various [performance monitoring tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/performance-monitoring-and-tuning-tools?view=sql-server-ver15) available for Azure SQL Databases.
For anayzing High CPU usage we recommend the following:

## **TSQL**

### If the CPU issue is occuring now:

* Many individual queries that cumulatively consume high CPU

```
PRINT '-- top 10 Active CPU Consuming Queries (aggregated)--';
SELECT TOP 10 GETDATE() runtime, *
FROM (SELECT query_stats.query_hash, SUM(query_stats.cpu_time) 'Total_Request_Cpu_Time_Ms', SUM(logical_reads) 'Total_Request_Logical_Reads', MIN(start_time) 'Earliest_Request_start_Time', COUNT(*) 'Number_Of_Requests', SUBSTRING(REPLACE(REPLACE(MIN(query_stats.statement_text), CHAR(10), ' '), CHAR(13), ' '), 1, 256) AS "Statement_Text"
    FROM (SELECT req.*, SUBSTRING(ST.text, (req.statement_start_offset / 2)+1, ((CASE statement_end_offset WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(ST.text)ELSE req.statement_end_offset END-req.statement_start_offset)/ 2)+1) AS statement_text
          FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS req
                CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(req.sql_handle) AS ST ) AS query_stats
    GROUP BY query_hash) AS t
ORDER BY Total_Request_Cpu_Time_Ms DESC;
```
* Long running queries that consume CPU are still running

```
PRINT '--top 10 Active CPU Consuming Queries by sessions--';
SELECT TOP 10 req.session_id, req.start_time, cpu_time 'cpu_time_ms', OBJECT_NAME(ST.objectid, ST.dbid) 'ObjectName', SUBSTRING(REPLACE(REPLACE(SUBSTRING(ST.text, (req.statement_start_offset / 2)+1, ((CASE statement_end_offset WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(ST.text)ELSE req.statement_end_offset END-req.statement_start_offset)/ 2)+1), CHAR(10), ' '), CHAR(13), ' '), 1, 512) AS statement_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS req
    CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(req.sql_handle) AS ST
ORDER BY cpu_time DESC;
GO
```

### If The CPU issue occurred in the past

```

-- note that a query  hash can have many query id if not parameterized or not parameterized properly
-- it grabs a sample query text by min

                       FROM sys.query_store_query_text AS qt
                            JOIN sys.query_store_query AS q ON qt.query_text_id=q.query_text_id

                       WHERE rs.execution_type_desc IN ('Regular', 'Aborted', 'Exception')AND rsi.start_time>=DATEADD(HOUR, -2, GETUTCDATE())
                       GROUP BY q.query_hash), OrderedCPU AS (SELECT query_hash, total_cpu_millisec, avg_cpu_millisec, max_cpu_millisec, max_logical_reads, number_of_distinct_plans, number_of_distinct_query_ids, total_executions, Aborted_Execution_Count, Regular_Execution_Count, Exception_Execution_Count, sampled_query_text, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_cpu_millisec DESC, query_hash ASC) AS RN
                                                              FROM AggregatedCPU)
SELECT OD.query_hash, OD.total_cpu_millisec, OD.avg_cpu_millisec, OD.max_cpu_millisec, OD.max_logical_reads, OD.number_of_distinct_plans, OD.number_of_distinct_query_ids, OD.total_executions, OD.Aborted_Execution_Count, OD.Regular_Execution_Count, OD.Exception_Execution_Count, OD.sampled_query_text, OD.RN
FROM OrderedCPU AS OD
WHERE OD.RN<=15
ORDER BY total_cpu_millisec DESC;
```

## **Query Store**

The SQL Server [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=sql-server-ver15) feature provides you with insight on query plan choice and performance. It simplifies performance troubleshooting by helping you quickly find performance differences caused by query plan changes. Query Store automatically captures a history of queries, plans, and runtime statistics, and retains these for your review.
You can fetch the query ID's for TOP CPU Consuming (CPU TIME ms) queries by slecting the paticular metic under the regressed queries section of the Query store.

## **Query performance insights**

[Query Performance Insight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-query-performance?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630459/) provides intelligent query analysis for single and pooled databases. It helps identify the top resource consuming and long-running queries in your workload. This helps you find the queries to optimize to improve overall workload performance and efficiently use the resource that you are paying for.

## **Recommended Documents**

* Poor performance in Azure SQL DB is most often either related to excessive CPU utilization or a query waiting on a resource. To resolve either of these issues, review [Monitoring and performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630450/).

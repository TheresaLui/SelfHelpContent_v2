<!--issueDescription-->
We were able to detect the following on-premises agent(s) offline:<br>
**<!--$OnPremAgentOfflineList--> OnPremAgentOfflineList <!--/$OnPremAgentOfflineList-->**
<!--/issueDescription-->

Any of the following conditions might be present:

- **Cause**: The client agent is offline.

- **Resolution**: Be sure that the client agent is online and then try again.


- **Cause**: The client agent is uninstalled or missing.

- **Resolution**: If the client agent is uninstalled or otherwise missing:

    1. Remove the agent XML file from the SQL Data Sync installation folder, if the file exists.
    2. Install the agent on an on-premises computer (it can be the same or a different computer). Then, submit the agent key that's generated in the portal for the agent that's showing as offline.


- **Cause**: The SQL Data Sync service is stopped.

- **Resolution**: Restart the SQL Data Sync service:

    1. In the **Start** menu, search for **Services**
    2. In the search results, select **Services**
    3. Find the **SQL Data Sync** service
    4. If the service status is **Stopped**, right-click the service name, and then select **Start**

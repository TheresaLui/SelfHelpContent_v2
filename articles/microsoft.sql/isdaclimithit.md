<!--issueDescription-->
Between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> UTC and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> UTC, the database <!--$DatabaseName-->DatabaseName<!--/$DatabaseName--> on server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->, DAC (Dedicated Admin Connection) limit of one was reached and therefore new connection(s) were denied.

To guarantee that there are resources available for the connection, only one DAC is allowed at a time. In your case, DAC connection was already active, and the new request to connect your database through the DAC was denied with error.

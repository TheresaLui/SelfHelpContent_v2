# Configuring maintenance notifications

Advance notifications are available for Azure SQL databases that have their maintenance window configured.

## **Recommended Steps**

Notifications can be configured so you can get texts, emails, Azure push notifications, and voicemails when planned maintenance is due to begin in the next 24 hours. Additional notifications are sent when maintenance begins and when maintenance ends.
See how to [enable advance notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/advance-notifications#create-an-advance-notification).

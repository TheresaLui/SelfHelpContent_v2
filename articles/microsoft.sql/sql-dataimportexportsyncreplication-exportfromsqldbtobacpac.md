# BACPAC, DataSync, Copy DB and Replication/export from SQL db to BACPAC

SQL DB Export service supports exporting an Azure SQL database to a BACPAC file. For databases over 150 GBs, we recommend using [sqlpackage.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-export#export-to-a-bacpac-file-using-the-sqlpackage-utility) to perform the export.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Unable to authenticate request

* Export service does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA). If you are using AAD, make sure MFA is disabled and retry the export. If MFA is required, please use [sqlpackage.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-export#export-to-a-bacpac-file-using-the-sqlpackage-utility).

### There is an import or export operation in progress on the database

* Export service does not allow issuing multiple requests for the same database. Please wait until the current operation is finished.

### Cancelling the export job

* This capability is not yet available to customers. We are actively working on it. In the meantime, please file a ticket to get your export cancelled.

### Blob already exists

* A bacpac file with the same name already exists in Azure Blob storage. Please choose a different name for the file.

### Failure with code 504

* This is most commonly caused when the server's firewall is blocking the Export service. Make sure to [add a rule to the server's firewall to allow access from Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure#manage-server-level-ip-firewall-rules-using-the-azure-portal).

### Export operation has been running for a long time (or progress seems stuck)

* Export speed depends on the following factors:

	* The data shape (schema) and the data size
	* The volume of export requests submitted simultaneously in a region. In situations where the volume of requests is very high, an export job can spend considerable time [waiting for resources to become available before it can start](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2965554/azure-sql-database-import-export-service-takes-a-long-time-to-import-o).

 * To get the best performance, we recommend:
 
	* Using [sqlpackage.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-export#export-to-a-bacpac-file-using-the-sqlpackage-utility).
	* Making sure no other workload is running on the database. Creating a copy before export may be the best solution to ensure no other workload.
	* Increase database SLO to better handle the export workload (primarily read IO)
	* Making sure there are clustered indexes particularly for large tables
	* Making sure the storage account where the BACPAC file will be saved is in the same region as the database to avoid unnecessary network latencies

## **Recommended Documents**

* For an export to be transactionally consistent, you must ensure either that no write activity is occurring during the export, or that you are exporting from a [transactionally consistent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-copy) copy of your Azure SQL database
* More details can be found in [Export an Azure SQL database to a BACPAC file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-export?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630420/)

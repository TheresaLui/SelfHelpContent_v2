# Failover Group Migration may impact your service

<!--issueDescription-->
The connectivity through failover groups and server DNS aliases hosted on the server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName <!--/$ServerName--> were briefly affected by server migration performed as a mitigation for a recent configuration change, which prevented a backend service from being accessible. We apologize for the inconvenience it caused to your business.

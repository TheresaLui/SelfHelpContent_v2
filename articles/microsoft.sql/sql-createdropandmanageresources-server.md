**Capacity challenges and restrictions**

As demand continues to grow, we are faced with temporary capacity constraints in a number of Azure regions so we have established clear criteria for the priority of new cloud capacity. 

As mentioned in our commitment to customers and Microsoft cloud services continuity [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customers-and-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/), top priority is going to first responders, health and emergency management services, critical government infrastructure, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running with the core functionality. We will also constrain non-paid subscriptions as necessary, to ensure support of existing paid customers, so free trial & benefit subscriptions may see limited resource options and limited regions available.

If you would like assistance with this, please create a support request with our Quota team by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/quota-increase-request).

**Blocked creating a server in a region**

If you are having troubles creating a server in a region and are seeing errors such as `'This location is not available for subscription'` in the Server create Portal blade, and you require assistance in obtaining access to that region please create a support request to the Quota team using these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/quota-increase-request#other).

**Resource limit constraints**

If you are experiencing resource constraint limits related to:
- Max number of databases per server
- Max number of servers per subscription in any region
- Max number of Database transaction units (DTUs) per server
- Max number of vCores per server
- Max number of Elastic pools per server

See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-resource-limits-database-server) for more details on the default SQL database resource limits for a SQL Database server.

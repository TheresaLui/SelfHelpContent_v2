# Resolve Blocking and deadlock issues with Azure SQL Database

### **Blocking**

Slow or long-running queries can contribute to excessive resource consumption and be the consequence of blocked queries; in other words poor performance. While the concepts of blocking are the same for SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, the default isolation level is different. [READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/snapshot-isolation-in-sql-server) is set to on for Azure SQL Databases.

Blocking is an unavoidable characteristic of any relational database management system with lock-based concurrency.

The query below will display the top ten running queries that have the longest total elapsed time and are blocking other queries:

```
SELECT TOP 10 
	r.session_id,r.plan_handle,r.sql_handle,r.request_id,r.start_time, r.status,r.command, r.database_id,r.user_id, r.wait_type
	,r.wait_time,r.last_wait_type,r.wait_resource, r.total_elapsed_time,r.cpu_time, r.transaction_isolation_level,r.row_count,st.text 
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r 
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) as st  
WHERE r.blocking_session_id = 0 and r.session_id in (SELECT distinct(blocking_session_id) FROM sys.dm_exec_requests) 
GROUP BY 
	r.session_id, r.plan_handle,r.sql_handle, r.request_id,r.start_time, r.status,r.command, r.database_id,r.user_id, r.wait_type
	,r.wait_time,r.last_wait_type,r.wait_resource, r.total_elapsed_time,r.cpu_time, r.transaction_isolation_level,r.row_count,st.text  
ORDER BY r.total_elapsed_time desc
```

### **Deadlock**

A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting on the same resource and each process is waiting on the other process to complete before moving forward.
The query below can help you capture deadlock:

```
WITH CTE AS (
       SELECT CAST(event_data AS XML)  AS [target_data_XML] 
       FROM sys.fn_xe_telemetry_blob_target_read_file('dl', null, null, null)

)

SELECT 
    target_data_XML.value('(/event/@timestamp)[1]', 'DateTime2') AS Timestamp,
    target_data_XML.query('/event/data[@name=''xml_report'']/value/deadlock') AS deadlock_xml,
    target_data_XML.query('/event/data[@name=''database_name'']/value').value('(/value)[1]', 'nvarchar(100)') AS db_name
FROM CTE
```

To obtain a deadlock graph:

* Copy the deadlock_xml column results from the previous query and load into a text file. If more than one row is returned, you will want to do each row result separately.
* Save the file as a '.xdl' extension, (e.g. deadlock.xdl) which can be viewed in tools such as SQL Server Management Studio as a deadlock report/graph

If you need to customize the events you capture when a deadlock occurs, you can create your own [Extended Events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/xevent-db-diff-from-svr) Session with the following events for a deadlock.

* Lock_Deadlock: Occurs when an attempt to acquire a lock is canceled for the victim of a deadlock
* Lock_deadlock_chain: Occurs when an attempt to acquire a lock generates a deadlock. This event is raised for each participant in the deadlock.

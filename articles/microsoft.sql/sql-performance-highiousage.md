# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found high IO or high log rate usage

<!--issueDescription-->

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

This indicates possible application slowness, timeouts due to lack of IO resources to execute the requested workload during that specific period. Please see the recommended articles for more details.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Consider batching to reduce IO consumption when doing large operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-use-batching-to-improve-performance)
* [Increase Azure Database tier to get more DTUs and hence accommodate for more IO in your environment](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/single)

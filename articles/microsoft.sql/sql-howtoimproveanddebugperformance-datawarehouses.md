# How to improve and debug performance

## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common performance issues, try the following methods.

1. Scaling SQL Data Warehouse up and down is easy and can provide a short burst of compute or a prolonged increase of performance.  If you are just starting out or have recently increased the amount of data you are working with we recommend trying a few DWU settings to understand which is right for you.<br>

2. Scaling your SQL Data Warehouse can impact concurrency.  Learn how you can manage concurrency with resource classes.<br>

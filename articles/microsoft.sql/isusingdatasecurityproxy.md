# Database connectivity issue due to auditing enabled secured connections

<!--issueDescription-->
We noticed that you are connecting to an auditing-enabled database <!--$DatabaseName-->DatabaseName<!--/$DatabaseName--> on server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName--> using secured connection strings (<!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->.database.secure.windows.net).
<!--/issueDescription-->

The secured connection strings were only used for databases with Table Auditing enabled, which is now deprecated. Connecting to database using the secure endpoints is unsupported, may cause connection errors/issues, and it is not a recommended option. We highly recommend you to use blob auditing which does not require any changes to your connection strings, and it is more efficient and less error prone.

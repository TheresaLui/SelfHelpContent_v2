# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue 

<!--issueDescription--> 
We have detected that your SQL Data Warehouse instance (server **<!--$ServerName--> ServerName <!--/$ServerName-->** , database **<!--$DatabaseName--> DatabaseName <!--/$DatabaseName-->**) is unavailable due to a long running transaction rollback. Long running recovery is caused when a large transaction's query is cancelled either by the user, by a query failure, or by a pause or scale operation. When the database comes online after the issue the transaction needs to be rolled back before the database becomes available, causing a longer than normal amount of time needed to resume the SQL Data Warehouse.
<!--/issueDescription--> 

We estimate the rollback should complete in **<!--$RecoveryEstimate--> RecoveryEstimate <!--/$RecoveryEstimate-->** hours from now, and your instance will be available again. 

### **Recommended documents**

We recommend allowing existing transactions to finish before you initiate a pause or scale operation.

Optimizing your transactions will also help to minimize logging and avoid long running recovery.

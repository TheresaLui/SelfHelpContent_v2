# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an ongoing scale issue.

**Summary of issue**<br>
You have initiated a scale operation on your Azure SQL DB database **<!--$DatabaseName-->DatabaseName<!--/$DatabaseName-->** in server **<!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->**. <br>
This operation is delayed due to slow copy of data between source and target performance tiers.

**Root cause investigation**<br>
The time required to complete an operation to change the performance tier of an Azure SQL Database depends on the mechanism used for the change. In some cases, the change can be done in as little as five minutes without copying data. In other cases unfortunately, it requires a copy, which may take longer depending on the size of the database. The maximum expected duration for even the largest databases is 6 hours for a Standard tier database on the smallest / least performant tier. For scale-up operations within Premium tiers, you can expect copying to last up to 3 hours. We are working on several improvements including a) reducing how often a copy is required, and b) introducing pause/resume capability which can be used instead of scaling, and is expected to take less than 5 minutes in all cases.

# The session limit for the database has been reached

**Error 10928: Resource ID : 1: The worker limit for the database has been reached**

Sessions refer to the number of concurrent connections allowed to a SQL database at a time. Workers can be thought of as the processes in the SQL database that are processing queries. The maximum number of workers allowed depends on your databasesâ€™s service tier.
Azure SQL DB limits the number of [concurrent workers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-limits-dtu-single-databases?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32745427) allowed to the database. 

Use the [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database?view=azuresqldb-current), to quickly check **Maximum concurrent workers (requests)** as a percentage of the limit of the database's service tier.
When the worker limit is reached, clients will receive an error message (Error 10928: Resource ID : 1) and will be unable to query your database.

## **Recommended Steps**

For an immediate solution, scale your database to a larger service tier sufficient to handle the workload.

Longer-term, you should:

* Optimize queries to reduce the resource utilization of each query if the cause of increased worker utilization is due to contention for compute resources. For more  information, see [Query Tuning/Hinting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/performance-guidance#query-tuning-and-hinting).
* Reduce the [MAXDOP](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option?view=sql-server-ver15#Guidelines) (maximum degree of parallelism) setting.
* Optimize query workload to reduce number of occurrences and duration of query blocking.

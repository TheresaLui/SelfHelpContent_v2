# The session limit for the database has been reached

**Error 10928: The session limit for the database has been reached**

For DTU-based service tiers, Azure SQL DB limits the number of [concurrent sessions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-limits-dtu-single-databases?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32745427) allowed to the database.  Your application is attempting to open more connections than is allowed for your service tier, which is usually due to increased workload.  If your application uses connection pooling, a slowdown in query response time may cause a constant rate of frontend requests to require more backend database connections.

**NOTE**: This error number is used when hitting the limit on either sessions (i.e., connections) or requests (i.e., concurrent queries). Confirm that your error message indicates you are hitting the *session limit*.

## **Recommended Steps**

For an immediate solution, scale your database to a larger DTU-based service tier sufficient to handle the workload.  Longer-term, you should either:
- Identify long running or resource intensive queries using [Query Performance Insight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-query-performance?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32745427) and look for other [performance bottlenecks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/identify-query-performance-issues?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32745427)).  Tune the application and queries so that your workload can be handled by the current service tier, or
- Switch to an elastic pool or vCore-based purchasing models, which effectively removes the session limit (setting it to 30000)

## **Recommended Documents**

[Resource limits for single databases using the vCore purchasing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-limits-vcore-single-databases?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32745427)

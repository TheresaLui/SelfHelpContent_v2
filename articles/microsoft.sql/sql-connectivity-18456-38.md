# Login failed - Could not find database requested by user

## **Login failed, the database requested by user could not be found**

<!--issueDescription-->
We ran diagnostics between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime--> and we were able to detect login failures.
<br>
The error returned indicated that the corresponding user does not exist inside the database, or the database user is orphaned due to a SID mapping mismatch between the user and the login in master.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Compare SQL logins in the master database with users in the user database
	
1. Open a connection to the master database. Execute the following T-SQL to return a list of configured SQL logins in the master database:

```
SELECT [name], SID
FROM sys.sql_logins 
WHERE type = 'S';
```

2. Open a connection to the user database. Execute the following T-SQL to return a list of configured users in the user database:

```
SELECT [name], SID, principal_id
FROM sys.database_principals 
WHERE type = 'S' 
  AND name NOT IN ('guest', 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA', 'sys')
  AND authentication_type_desc = 'INSTANCE';
```

3. If the required user does not exist in the user database, add the user by executing the CREATE USER statement in the user database, specifying the login name:

```
CREATE USER <user_name> FOR Login <login_name>; 
```

4. If the requested user does exist in the user database, the error is likely due to an orphaned user. In this case, comparing the two lists from step 1 should reveal a SID mismatch between the login in the master database and the user in the user database.

To map an orphaned user to a login which already exists in master, execute the ALTER USER statement in the user database, specifying the login name:

```
ALTER USER <user_name> WITH Login = <login_name>;
```

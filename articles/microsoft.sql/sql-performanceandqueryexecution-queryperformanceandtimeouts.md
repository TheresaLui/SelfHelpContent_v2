# Resolve poor performance and timeout issues in Azure SQL Database

## **Recommended Steps**

* Poor performance in Azure SQL DB is most often either related to excessive CPU utilization or a query waiting on a resource. To resolve either of these issues, review [Monitoring and performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630450/).
* Another very common reason for poor performance is the lack of maintenance tasks to keep statistics up to date and preventing index fragmentation. You can use the [How to maintain Azure SQL Indexes and Statistics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-Support-Blog/How-to-maintain-Azure-SQL-Indexes-and-Statistics/ba-p/368787) solution to prevent this from happening.

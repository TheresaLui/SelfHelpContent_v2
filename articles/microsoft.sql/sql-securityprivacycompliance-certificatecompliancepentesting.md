# Compliance and Certifications
    
Microsoft cloud services adhere to a broad set of certification and compliance requirements and provide tools to help our customers meet their cloud security and compliance [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/). We also provide an [overview of security capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview).

We commit to yearly audits and provide a full audit [report](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide). Microsoft offers a Financial Services Compliance Program built for large financial institutions. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview), where you can find the most current list of [SQL Database compliance certifications and offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-home?view=o365-worldwide). 

## Penetration Testing

- Microsoft performs [penetration testing of our Azure environment](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cloud-Red-Teaming-b837392e). This testing helps drive Azure improvements.

- As of June 15, 2017, Microsoft no longer requires pre-approval to conduct a [penetration test](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/pen-testing) against Azure resources. This process is related only to Microsoft Azure, and is not applicable to any other Microsoft cloud services.
    
- Although customers are no longer required to notify Microsoft of penetration testing activities, customers must still comply with the Microsoft Cloud Unified [Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement?rtc=3).

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I need to validate my penetration test report

- Penetration tests from scanners frequently produce false positives, which do not constitute a security risk. Often penetration tests report [issues](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue) due software not being patched with the most current updates or related to configuration, rather than due to a software vulnerability. 
- It is a best practice to manually verify the issue reported, using the guidance provided in [Microsoft Security Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/) and [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cybersecurity-Reference-883fb54c).  

#### Reporting Security Issues

- If you think that you've discovered a potential security issue related to the Microsoft Cloud or any other Microsoft service during penetration testing, report it to the [Microsoft Security Response Center MSRC](https://msrc.microsoft.com). 

- Microsoft offers bug bounty awards and recognition for many types of security issues. If you find a security issue in the Microsoft Cloud and want to be considered for a bounty, follow our [bug bounty rules and submission guidance](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/faqs-bounty). To receive a bounty, an organization will be required to complete a preregistration process to participate in the program. For more information, email bounty@microsoft.com.

#### TLS Version supported or compatible and [additional information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-content-reference-guide#tls-considerations-for-database-connectivity)
- Currently, we support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Setting a minimal TLS version ensures that newer TLS versions are [supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings#minimal-tls-version). You can set the minimum TLS version to your server by [using PowerShell or Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings#set-the-minimal-tls-version-via-powershell).

#### Add a password expiration policy to your login account
- Azure PaaS services, Azure SQL Database, and Synapse Analytics do not support changes and enforcement of password policies. Check the Create/Alter Login syntax based on the support of [CHECK_POLICY options in the SET Option](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-login-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current).

#### Is there public information to prove that the facilities (for example, power supplies) in the Azure datacenter are multiplexed?
- The power supply network is described in the [availability of the Azure infrastructure document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/infrastructure-availability), which is publicly available

#### Information on OS, security patches, and infrastructure maintenance details
- Azure SQL DB is a PaaS service and is maintained by Microsoft. Relevant information is shared based on compliance policy and is not available in public documentation. See [maintenance information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/planned-maintenance).

#### How does Microsoft build its global wide-area network (WAN)?
- The Microsoft global wide-area network (WAN) plays an important part in delivering a great cloud service experience. Connecting hundreds of datacenters in 38 regions around the world, our global network offers nearly perfect availability, high capacity, and the [flexibility to respond to unpredictable demand spikes](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/how-microsoft-builds-its-fast-and-reliable-global-network/).
 
#### How can I access a Private Endpoint?
- Private Link allows you to connect to various PaaS services in Azure through a [Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/private-endpoint-overview#how-to-set-up-private-link-for-azure-sql-database)

#### Is the connection to SQL Database safe and secure?
- [Learn how a connection established to Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-architecture#connectivity-architecture), with full security details.

#### How do I secure a database in Azure SQL Database?
- Follow [these step-by-step instructions to secure your database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/secure-database-tutorial)

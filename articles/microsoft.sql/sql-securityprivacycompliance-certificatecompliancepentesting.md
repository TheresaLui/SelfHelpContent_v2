# Compliance and Certifications
    
- Microsoft cloud services adhere to a broad set of certification, compliance requirements and provide tools to help our customers meet their cloud security & compliance [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/) and overview of [security capabilites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview).

- We commit to yearly audit and provide full audit [report](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/MSComplianceGuide). Microsoft offers Financial Services Compliance Program built for large financial institutes. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview) where you can find the most current list of SQL Database compliance certifications and [offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-home?view=o365-worldwide). 

## Penetration Testing

- Microsoft performs [penetration testing of our Azure environment](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cloud-Red-Teaming-b837392e). This testing helps drive Azure improvements.

- As of June 15, 2017, Microsoft no longer requires pre-approval to conduct a [penetration test](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/pen-testing) against Azure resources. This process is only related to Microsoft Azure, and not applicable to any other Microsoft Cloud Service.
    
- While notifying Microsoft of pen testing activities is no longer required customers must still comply with the Microsoft Cloud Unified [Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement?rtc=3).

### Frequently asked Questions

#### I need to validate my Pentest report

- Pen tests from scanners frequently produce false positives which do not constitute a security risk. Often pentest reported [issues](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/faqs-report-an-issue) are related to software not being patched with the most current updates or configuration related rather than a software vulnerability. 
- It is a best practice to manually verify the issue reported first with the assistance of [Microsoft Security Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/) and [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cybersecurity-Reference-883fb54c).  

#### Reporting Security Issues

- During your penetration testing you believe you discovered a potential security flaw related to the Microsoft Cloud or any other Microsoft service, please report it to the [Microsoft Security Response Center MSRC](https://msrc.microsoft.com). 

- Microsoft offers bug bounty awards and recognition for many types of security issues. If you find a security issue in the Microsoft Cloud, and wish to be considered for a bounty, please follow our bug bounty rules and submission guidance, [located here](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/faqs-bounty). To receive a bounty, an organization will be required to complete a pre-registration process to participate in the program. Please email bounty@microsoft.com for complete details.

#### TLS Version supported or compatible and [additional information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-content-reference-guide#tls-considerations-for-database-connectivity)
- Currently, we support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Setting a minimal TLS version ensures that newer TLS versions are [supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings#minimal-tls-version). You can set the Minimum TLS version to your server, [using PowerShell or Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings#set-the-minimal-tls-version-via-powershell)

#### How you can add a password expiration policy to your login account
- Azure PaaS services Azure SQL Database and Synapse Analytics (Synapse Analytics) do not support changes and enforcement of password policies. In this regard, you can check the Create/Alter Login syntax below, based on the support of [CHECK_POLICY options in the SET Option](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-login-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current).

#### Is there public information to prove that the facilities (power supplies, etc.) in the Azure datacenter are multiplexed
- The power supply, network was described in the public materials. [Availability of the Azure infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/infrastructure-availability)

#### Information on OS, Security patches and Infrastructure maintenance details.

- As Azure SQL DB is a PaaS service and its maintained by Microsoft. Relevant information is shared based on compliance policy and not available in public documentation. 
    [Maintenance information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/planned-maintenance)

#### How Microsoft builds its fast and reliable global network.
- The Microsoft global wide-area network (WAN) plays an important part in delivering a great cloud service experience. Connecting hundreds of datacenters in 38 regions around the world, our global network offers near-perfect availability, high capacity, and the [flexibility to respond to unpredictable demand spikes](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/how-microsoft-builds-its-fast-and-reliable-global-network/).
 
#### Private Endpoints
- Private Link allows you to connect to various PaaS services in Azure via a [private endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/private-endpoint-overview#how-to-set-up-private-link-for-azure-sql-database)

#### Connection to SQL Database is safe and secure ?
- How a connection established to Azure SQL Database is [explained here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-architecture#connectivity-architecture) with complete details of security.

##### How to Secure database in Azure SQL Database
- Follow the step-by-step process to [secure your database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/secure-database-tutorial)

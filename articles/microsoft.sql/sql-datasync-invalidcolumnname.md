# Data Sync - Invalid column name

## We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->  
We were able to detect that Data Sync is facing errors during sync attempts due to columns not being present in the tables to be synchronized.<br>
If sync schema tables are missing in the destination database, SQL Data Sync creates them with the columns you selected. **However, if the table already exists, SQL Data Sync will not create the missing columns**.<br>

Data Sync is detecting missing columns on the following sync group(s):<br>

<!--$SyncGroupInvalidColumnNameList--> SyncGroupInvalidColumnNameList <!--/$SyncGroupInvalidColumnNameList-->

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Create the missing columns manually in all databases.

**Note:** SQL Data Sync auto-provisioning feature may not create a full-fidelity schema for the following reasons:

* Only columns you select are created in the destination table. Columns not selected are ignored.
* Only selected column indexes are created in the destination table. For columns not selected, those indexes are ignored.
* Indexes on XML type columns aren't created.
* CHECK constraints aren't created.
* Triggers on the source tables aren't created.
* Views and stored procedures aren't created.

Because of these limitations, we recommend the following things:

* For production environments, create the full-fidelity schema yourself.
* When experimenting with the service, use the auto-provisioning feature.

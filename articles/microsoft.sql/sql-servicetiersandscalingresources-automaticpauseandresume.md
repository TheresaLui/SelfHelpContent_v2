# Issues for SQL DB Serverless

Serverless is price-performance optimized for single databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns that can afford some delay in compute warm-up after idle usage periods. In contrast, the provisioned compute tier is price-performance optimized for single databases or multiple databases in elastic pools with higher average usage that cannot afford any delay in compute warm-up.<br>

Scenarios well-suited for serverless compute: <br>
Single databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns interspersed with periods of inactivity and lower average compute utilization over time.<br>
Single databases in the provisioned compute tier that are frequently rescaled and customers who prefer to delegate compute rescaling to the service.<br>
New single databases without usage history where compute sizing is difficult or not possible to estimate prior to deployment in SQL Database.<br>

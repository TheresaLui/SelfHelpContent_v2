# I received a provisioning or deployment timeout error

4 out of 5 customers resolved their issue with the guides listed below.<br>

## **Recommended Steps**
When you try to create a new Azure Virtual Machine (VM), the common errors you encounter are provisioning failures or allocation failures.<br>

A provisioning failure happens when the OS image fails to load either due to incorrect preparatory steps or because of selecting the wrong settings during the image capture from the portal.<br>

An allocation failure results when the cluster or region either does not have resources available or cannot support the requested VM size.<br>

For other VM deployment issues and questions, see [Troubleshoot deploying Linux virtual machine issues in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-deploy-vm-windows).<br>

# Customer needs advisory help.

Some common customer questions on this topic are listed below with their answers. If you do not find answers to the customer questions here, please escalate using the escalation process defined at the bottom of this card. 

1. **How can we setup Storage Explorer such that a user has access only to a particular container?** Storage Explorer now has a feature which lets users connect directly to a particular container using AAD Authentication. Make sure the customer is using the latest version of the tool. [Please visit.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#add-a-resource-via-azure-ad)

2. **How can we verify which user/application is accessing my data?** Customers can setup Azure Monitor based Diagnostics logs on their Storage Account to log all the Blob/Queue Storage operations happening on their Storage Account. In these logs, if AAD Auth is used, customers can find the AAD Object ID of the user/application which accessed their data. More details on this can be [found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage-reference#resource-logs-preview).

3. **How long would a new Role Assignments take to propogate?** Azure role assignments may take up to five minutes to propagate. If you notice a certain role assignment taking longer to propogate, we may need to engage the EEEs/PG to have a look at the same. 

4. **How to generate a SAS token using a user's Azure AD credentials?** Customers can create user delegation SAS tokens for this purpose. A user delegation SAS is supported for Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. [Visit this for more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas).

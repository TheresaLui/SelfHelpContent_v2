# Issue with credit or refund

### **Azure Free Account offer**

The Azure Free Account offer includes $200 of Azure credits (to be used within the first 30 days of sign-up) and 12 months of select free services (subject to change). This offer is limited to one per eligible customer and cannot be combined with any other offer unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft. Within 30 days of sign-up or upon exhaustion of the credits, whichever occurs first, you must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account by removing the Spending Limit. This allows continued use of the Azure Free Account for the remaining 11 months. Post the upgraded, usage outside the initial credits and select free services will be billed at Pay-As-You-Go rates. If the subscription is not upgraded, it will be disabled.

If you'd like to learn more, see [Products available monthly for free under Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/).

### **Visual Studio Offer**

The Visual Studio offer includes monthly credit. Amount depends on the type of [Visual Studio Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/) you have.  Your Azure services will stop when the monthly credit gets completely used up till your next month credit gets added. You can choose to remove your monthly cap by upgrading to [Pay-As-You-Go pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).

More details on Visual Studio offers are available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).

### **Validate usage and charges**

If you believe you have unexpected/unknown charges on the account or subscription, follow the below steps.

* We highly recommend to use Cost Analysis feature in [Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/overview) page to analyze your cost that help understand the charges at various levels (By Billing period, subscription, resource group, services etc...). Go through the short video in [Explore and analyze costs with Cost Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis?tabs=azure-portal) to learn more.
* Download your usage data and verify if you have any unwanted services or resources running. To learn more, see [Download Azure usage data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#download-usage).

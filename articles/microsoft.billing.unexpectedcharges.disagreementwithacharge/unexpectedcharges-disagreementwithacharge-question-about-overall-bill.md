# Question about overall bill

## **Recommended Steps**

To understand and review the bill for your pay-as-you-go or Visual Studio Azure subscription, including pay-as-you-go and Visual Studio see [Tutorial: Review your individual Azure subscription bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/review-individual-bill). This tutorial applies only to Azure customers with an individual subscription. Common individual subscriptions are those with pay-as-you-go rates purchased directly from the Azure website.

If you need help understanding unexpected charges, see [Analyze unexpected charges](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/analyze-unexpected-charges).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

* Compare invoiced charges with usage file
* Compare charges and usage in cost analysis

### **Review invoice for resource responsible for charge**

How you purchase your Azure services helps you determine the methodology and tools that are available to you as you identify the resource associated with a charge. To determine which methodology applies to you, first [determine your Azure offer type](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#determine-your-offer-type). Then, identify your customer category in the list of [supported Azure offers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers).

The following articles provide detailed steps that explain how to review your bill based on your customer type. In each article there are instructions about how to download a CSV file containing usage and cost details for a given billing period.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I never signed up for this service**

Azure provides a Cost Management tool to understand the resource that is causing the service-related prices. [Review this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis?tabs=azure-portal) on performing costs analysis using the Cost Management tool. This can help you identify the resource that was deployed for the service-related price.

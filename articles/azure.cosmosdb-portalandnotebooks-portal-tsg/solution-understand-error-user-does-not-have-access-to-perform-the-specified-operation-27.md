##Back ground/Cause
 
ARM have released a feature called ?Blue Print? which basically helps to ACL a deny permission.   This feature is basically restricting the portal to get the Cosmos DB key triggering the below issue.

You can confirm that the ARM is causing the issue by Query in ARM Prod Kuto endpoint.  Any result from the query does indicate that the Blue Print/ARM is causing this issue.

```
Traces
| where TIMESTAMP > ago(1d)
| where operationName == "AuthorizationFilterEngine.FilterResourcesByDenyAssignment"
| where message startswith "Received '0' resources. Returning '0' resources after filtering by deny assignment. Orignial groups count"
| where subscriptionId =="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
| project TIMESTAMP, ActivityId, subscriptionId, operationName,message
| limit 10
```
<br>

	
|TIMESTAMP|ActivityId|subscriptionId|operationName|message|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|2019-06-12 13:42:11.5788270|xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx|xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx|AuthorizationFilterEngine.FilterResourcesByDenyAssignment|Received '0' resources. Ret|

<br>
<br>

###Quick way to Confirm ARM issue
 

You can run the Azure CLI and if the keys are not shown then the arm is not returning the keys due to the ACL from Blue Print.
`
az cosmosdb list-read-only-keys --name MyCosmosDBDatabaseAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup
`

###Example  
`
az cosmosdb list-read-only-keys --name MyCosmosDBDatabaseAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup
`
 
<br>
 
##Mitigation
 

- They can use the sunset link if they have connection string for cosmosdb account.  
or
- They need to remove the Deny by removing configuration through Blue Print.

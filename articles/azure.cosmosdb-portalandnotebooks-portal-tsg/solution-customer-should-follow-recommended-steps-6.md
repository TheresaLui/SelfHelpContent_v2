<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

* Before further troubleshooting, clear your browser cache and reload the page. This will ensure you are using the latest version of the Data Explorer.
* Load the Data Explorer in Incognito or private browsing mode. If the issue does not occur there, then clearing your cache in your original browsing session and reloading will resolve the issue. If the issue continues to occur in Incognito mode, please contact us for support. 

If the above steps don't work please kindly share the HAR file, see the steps below:
1. Open the developer tools in Chrome or Edge, then reproduce your issue. After reproducing the issue, save the network traces as a HAR file:
- In Chrome, right-click anywhere inside the Network pane and select 'Save as HAR with Content' or from the drop-down actions menu.
- In Edge Click command to ?Export as HAR? or typing [Ctrl] + [S]
2. This will open a dialog allowing you to select where to save your HAR file. Please attach this HAR file to expedite the investigation

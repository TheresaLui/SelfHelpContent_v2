# Enable Free Tier when creating a new account in the Azure Portal is not appearing

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

You can have up to one Free Tier account in an Azure subscription. If the option does not appear, this means another account in the subscription is already enabled with Free Tier.

Thank you.

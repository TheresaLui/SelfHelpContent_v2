# Optimize Delta Issues

Delta optimizations accelerate data lake operations, supporting a variety of workloads ranging from large-scale ETL processing to ad-hoc, interactive queries. Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/delta/optimizations/) for more details on optimizations.

Some of the following steps would need access to customer's workspace for validations and debugging. Please make sure to get these information from customer:

1. Detailed issue description
2. Subscription ID
3. Workspace ID/URL
4. Cluster Name/ID/URL
5. Was it working fine before? Were there any changes made?
6. Delta table and query details
7. Steps to repro 
8. Customer consent to allow Microsoft/Databricks access workspace and logs for investigation purposes

And follow this [wiki](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureDataBricks/_wiki/wikis/AzureDataBricks.wiki/312341/Access-and-Use-Genie) to access workspace.

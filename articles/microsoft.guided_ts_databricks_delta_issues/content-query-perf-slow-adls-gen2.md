# Delta table query performance is slow when underlying data directory is in ADLS Gen2 file system

**Problem**

Query against delta table is slow when the delta tableâ€™s data is in ADLS Gen2 filesystem
This problem affects clusters on Databricks Runtime 5.4 or earlier.

**Troubleshooting**

* Verify if they are using DBR 5.4 or earlier version
* Verify if the storage system being used is ADLS Gen2

**Cause**

The DBR 5.4 and earlier versions check for the latest version of a Delta Lake table on ADLS Gen2 by listing all available versions and then finds the latest version of Delta table.

**Solution**

In DBR 5.5, improvement has been made to check only the end of the transaction log instead of listing all available versions. This optimization makes update a constant time operation, and significantly improving the latency. Use DBR 5.5 or above to see improvement in the Delta table query performance.

# Writing to a Delta table doesn't merge schema when mergeSchema is set to true

<!--issueDescription-->

Based on provided details and initial investigation, please find a summary of issue as below:

## **Problem**

While writing a dataframe to a delta table, it doesnâ€™t automatically update the schema of delta table, even though the mergeSchema option is set to true.

## **Cause**

This mergeSchema option will not work if the command is executed from a table access control enabled cluster. This will also not work with INSERT INTO operation.

## **Solution**

Use non-ACL enabled cluster to merge schema of the delta table.

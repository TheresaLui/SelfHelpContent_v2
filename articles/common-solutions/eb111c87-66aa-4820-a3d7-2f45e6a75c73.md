# Sequence of API calls

When using the Embedded C SDK, a normal question is the sequence in which the API call need to be executed. this article shows what is the expected sequence of calls and details about how to use them. 

## **Recommended Steps**

Please refer to the [guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/docs/iot/mqtt_state_machine.md). The minimum set of functionality needed to connect to the Azure IoT Hub and exchange messages is to:

1. Establish a secure socket connection with the Azure IoT Hub:

	* Connect to the port where the Azure IoT Hub listens for MQTT connections (8883, or 443 if using MQTT over WebSockets) - [reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-protocols)	
	* Encrypt the connection using a SSL API (example: OpenSSL) and the highest TLS version supported (currently TLS 1.2) - [reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-tls-support)	
	* Validate the server certificate using the proper root certificate (Baltimore CyberTrust Root - [reference](https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm))

2. Connect a MQTT client to the Azure IoT Hub, providing proper authentication information:

	* The Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT client must be initialized using `az_iot_hub_client_init`
	* Authentication schemes:

		* If using x509 certs for device authentication, client certificate must be set on the TLS layer to be presented to the Azure IoT Hub
		* MQTT client must use username obtained with `az_iot_hub_client_get_user_name` and empty (NULL) password: [Example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/hub/src/paho_iot_hub_telemetry_example.c)

	* If using SAS tokens:
		* MQTT client must use username obtained with `az_iot_hub_client_get_user_name` and password obtained with `az_iot_hub_client_sas_get_signature` and `az_iot_hub_client_sas_get_password`: [Example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/hub/src/paho_iot_hub_sas_telemetry_example.c)

3. Subscribe to the topics expected by the Azure IoT Hub for the features if supports:

	* Use the following macros or functions to provide the topics the MQTT client must subscribe to to use the features supported by Azure IoT Hub:
		* AZ_IOT_HUB_CLIENT_C2D_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC
		* AZ_IOT_HUB_CLIENT_METHODS_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC
		* AZ_IOT_HUB_CLIENT_TWIN_RESPONSE_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC
		* AZ_IOT_HUB_CLIENT_TWIN_PATCH_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC
	
Please refer to the header for more [Documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/inc/azure/iot/az_iot_hub_client.h).
	
4. Parse messages received from the Azure IoT Hub: 

Messages sent by the Azure IoT Hub for the features supported have specific topic names, which contains the key information of each response. The following functions shall be used to parse the relevant information from the topic names for each feature:

* az_iot_hub_client_c2d_parse_received_topic
* az_iot_hub_client_methods_parse_received_topic
* az_iot_hub_client_twin_parse_received_topic
	
Please refer to the header for more [Documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/inc/azure/iot/az_iot_hub_client.h).

5. Publish messages to the topics expected by the Azure IoT Hub for the features if supports:

Use the following functions to provide the topics the MQTT client must publish to to use the features supported by Azure IoT Hub:

* az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_get_publish_topic
* az_iot_hub_client_methods_response_get_publish_topic
* az_iot_hub_client_twin_document_get_publish_topic
* az_iot_hub_client_twin_patch_get_publish_topic

Please refer to the header for more [Documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/inc/azure/iot/az_iot_hub_client.h).

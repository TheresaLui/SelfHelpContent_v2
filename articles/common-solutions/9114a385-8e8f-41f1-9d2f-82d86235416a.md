# Configure Network Ports

There are six ports provided with the ASE. Make sure you connect the computer to PORT 1 on your device for the initial setup.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. When you plug in the network cable into the ethernet port, ensure that the ethernet port LEDs are flickering
2. Ensure that the cable from the 1 Gbps port is connected to the 1 Gbps network switch
3. On your physical device, there are six network interfaces. PORT 1 and PORT 2 are 1-Gbps network interfaces.
4. PORT 3, PORT 4, PORT 5, and PORT 6 are all 25-Gbps network interfaces that can also serve as 10-Gbps network interfaces
5. PORT 1 is automatically configured as a management-only port, and PORT 2 to PORT 6 are all data ports
6. In the left pane on the local UI, select Network settings and then configure the settings

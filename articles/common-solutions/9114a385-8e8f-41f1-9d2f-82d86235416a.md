# Configure Network Ports

Use the following procedure to configure network ports on your Azure Stack Edge (ASE) device. 

There are six ports provided with the ASE. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure that you connect the computer to PORT 1 on your device for the initial setup
2. When you plug the network cable into the ethernet port, ensure that the ethernet port LEDs are flickering
3. Ensure that the cable from the 1 Gbps port is connected to the 1 Gbps network switch
   On your physical device, there are six network interfaces: 
   - PORT 1 and PORT 2 are 1-Gbps network interfaces
   - PORT 3, PORT 4, PORT 5, and PORT 6 are all 25-Gbps network interfaces that can also serve as 10-Gbps network interfaces
   - PORT 1 is automatically configured as a management-only port, and PORT 2 to PORT 6 are all data ports

3. In the left pane on the local UI, select **Network settings**, and then configure the settings

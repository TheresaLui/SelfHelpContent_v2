# Connection to Availability Group, FCI or Listener

Most users can resolve their SQL Listener connectivity or load balancer issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. On Azure virtual machines, a SQL Server Availability Group requires a Load Balancer to be configured correctly, or Listener connectivity may fail. Check the [Load balancer Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial#create-an-azure-load-balancer). Make sure that **Floating IP** is enabled when you configure the Load Balancing rule.

1. Figure out the **Variables** by using the following chart and ensure that you have [run PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-tutorial#configure-listener). After you run the PowerShell to configure the cluster parameters, restart the AG role.
       
    * **Cluster Network Name:** In Failover Cluster Manager > **Networks**, right-click the network and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.
    
    * **SQL Server FCI/AG Listener IP Address Resource Name:** In Failover Cluster Manager > **Roles**, under the **SQL Server FCI role**, under **Server Name**, right-click the **IP address resource** and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.
    
    * **ILBIP:** Find ILBIP in the Failover Cluster Manager on the same properties page where you located the SQL Server FCI/AG Listener IP Address Resource Name.
    
    * **nnnnn:** This is the probe port that you configured in the load balancer's health probe (such as 59999). Any unused TCP port is valid.

### Avoid issues with Listener Connectivity

1. Check the **SQL Instance Port** (for example, 1433), **Mirroring Endpoint** (example 5022), and **Probe Port** (example 59999). You can [telnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/telnet) to the Port or use [Test-NetConnection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=win10-ps#example-3--test-tcp-connectivity-and-display-detailed-results) to check that the ports are not blocked at NSG or Windows Firewall. 

2. Make sure the SQL instance is running on [**Static Port**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-server-to-listen-on-a-specific-tcp-port?view=sql-server-ver15).

3. If you have configured Listener on any port other than 1433, you must use the port number in the Client connection string (for example: ListenerName, Port)

4. Make sure your instance is enabled for TCP/IP communication and has the [**Listen All**](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/tools/configuration-manager/tcp-ip-properties-ip-addresses-tab?view=sql-server-ver15#options) property set. Make sure that the browser service is running. 

5. If you are connecting outside from a different network or on-premises, make sure that your company firewall is not blocking these connections. Check with your Network Admin.

6. If you are not able to connect to Listener, try to connect using SSMS WITH various combinations such as (Listener name, Port) or (Listener IP, Port) to make sure you are not having and DNS name resolution issues. Check on DNS Server that the record for the Listener still exists and is pointing to the correct IP Address.

7. You may see issues connecting to Listener if your AG failed over, your [lease timed out](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-lease-healthcheck-timeout?view=sql-server-ver15#updating-cluster-and-always-on-timeout-values), if you are having issues with [SQL Performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices), or because of [Disk or VM Throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-performance-windows). Check the SQL error log to find out more.
  
8. If Create Listener fails with Message 19471, "The WSFC cluster could not bring the Network Name resource online," review [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/alwaysonpro/create-listener-fails-with-message-the-wsfc-cluster-could-not-bring-the-network-name-resource-online).

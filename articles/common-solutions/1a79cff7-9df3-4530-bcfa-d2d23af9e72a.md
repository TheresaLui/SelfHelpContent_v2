# ASC missing resources self-help guide

## **Recommended Steps**

### You follow up on a recommendation and you see a blank resource page

You may have reached the recommendation from external resource like Security blade, Advisor, or a linked article pointing to the recommendations.

This is a known issue. Check the [What's new in Azure Security Center?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/release-notes) page. For a workaround, check the recommendation from the Azure Security Center portal.

### You selected a recommendation and it returns no resources, even though the Recommendations main page indicates unhealthy resources   

1. Try these steps first:  
   - Clear browser cache
   - Use a different browser
   - Load the recommendation from different network location
2. Get more details from Azure Resource Graph (ARG):
   - Copy the recommendation name
   - Paste it in the Search recommendation box  
   The same recommendation may appear under more than one control. If it does, check if the number of Unhealthy resources appears the same on all other controls.
   - Go to Resource Graph Explorer and enter the following query:
   
      ```
      securityresources
      | where type == "microsoft.security/assessments"
      | where properties.displayName == "<Recommendation Name>"
      | parse kind=relaxed id with * "/virtualMachines/" VMName "/providers/" *
      | project VMName, resourceGroup, subscriptionId
      ```
### **If none of the preceding steps work, it is most likely a bug**  

 - Proceed, while capturing the browser network traces, to the HAR file. Learn [how to Generate Network Captures for Troubleshooting

# Resource Move

Resource move between subscriptions in the same geography is in private preview. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1.  Open a support ticket to have the product team involved help with the resource move.  

### **Notes**

Resource move will only move the Azure Stack Edge resource. Dependent services such as Key Vault will not be moved.

# ADF Roles and Permissions

Most users are able to resolve ADF Roles and Permissions issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Review your ADF Security Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/security-baseline)<br>
2. To create and manage child resources in the Azure portal, you must belong to the Data Factory Contributor role at the Resource Group level or above. <br>
3. For instructions on assigning resource level roles and permissions, see [ADF Roles and Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.comazure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)<br>
4. For instructions on assigning custom roles and permissions, see [Azure Custom Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)<br>

**Note:** Resource Manager template deployment with the Data Factory Contributor role does not elevate your permissions. <br>

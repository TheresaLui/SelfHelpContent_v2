# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Can I add a native client application to my Azure Active Directory B2C tenant?** 

Native client resources need to be registered in your tenant before your application can communicate with Azure Active Directory B2C. 

To register an application in your Azure AD B2C tenant, you can use our [new unified App registrations experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-native-application?tabs=app-reg-ga) or our [legacy Applications (Legacy) experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-native-application?tabs=applications-legacy). 

### **Can we have Sign-in using an iOS or Android application in Azure Active Directory B2C?**  

The Microsoft identity platform uses open standards such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. These standards allow you to leverage any library you wish to integrate with Azure Active Directory B2C. Most libraries that implement the [RFC6749 OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) spec can connect to the Microsoft Identity platform.

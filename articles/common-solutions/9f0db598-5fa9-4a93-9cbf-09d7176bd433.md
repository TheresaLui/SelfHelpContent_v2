# Missing data in Log Analytics

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are unable to see any data in the Log Analytics workspace at a certain time everyday, you may have reached the default 500 MB limit or the daily cap specified to control the amount of data to collect daily. When the limit is met for the day, data collection stops and resumes only on the next day. To review your data usage and update to a different pricing tier based on your anticipated usage patterns, please see information in [Log data usage and cost](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage).

# Azure Security Center (ASC) UI issues self-help guide 

## **Recommended Steps**

- I receive an error trying to access a certain flow in Security Center portal:
  - First, look at the error itself presented – sometimes the experience for a valid case and for an error are similar. Make sure the text does not indicate a "Not found" or "No permissions" error. 
  - In case of 'No Permissions' error, please review the ASC permissions document - [Permissions in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-permissions) 
- If you cannot find a readable description, this is likely a product bug.  
  To help us resolve this issue, please resume with this support request and please provide us with the session ID, including the [HAR](https://support.box.com/hc/articles/360043696054-How-to-Generate-Network-Captures-for-Troubleshooting) file of your session that may be useful. 
- In some cases, the error you experience can be worked around by trying to access a flow using a different browser. 
- I do not see any data or seeing only partial data 
  - Please make sure you have the right permissions – some flows in ASC are optimized for subscription-level access, and having only partial access (e.g. at the resource group level) may result in seemingly missing data which you do not have permissions to access.

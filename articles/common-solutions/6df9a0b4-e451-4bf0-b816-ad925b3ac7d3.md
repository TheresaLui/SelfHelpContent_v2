# Azure Security Center (ASC) UI issues self-help guide 

Resolve Azure Security Center (ASC) issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Issue: I receive an error trying to access a certain flow in Security Center portal**

  - First, look at the error itself presented. Sometimes the experience for a valid case and for an error are similar. Make sure the text does not indicate a "Not found" or "No permissions" error. 
     - In case of a "No Permissions" error,  review the ASC permissions document - [Permissions in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-permissions) 
     - If you cannot find a readable description, this is likely a product bug. To help us resolve this issue, resume this support request, providing us with the session ID and the [HAR](https://support.box.com/hc/articles/360043696054-How-to-Generate-Network-Captures-for-Troubleshooting) file of your session. 
  
- Try accessing a flow using a different browser to work around the error. 

- If you do not see any data or are seeing only partial data, make sure that you have the right permissions. Some flows in ASC are optimized for subscription-level access. Having only partial access (for example, at the resource group level) may result in seemingly missing data, which you don't have permission to access.

# Function App Down or Reporting Errors

## **Recommended Steps**

**If your function application is unavailable, check the following:**

1. Is your Host App running from Azure Functions homepage?

    If you havenâ€™t disabled the [Azure Functions homepage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsdisablehomepage), then browsing from a site homepage should show you a page if the Functions Host is running.

2. Are you targeting the right Azure Functions Runtime version?

    Check the Azure Functions Runtime version to see if you are targeting the right version for your application. Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions#changing-version-of-apps-in-azure) for more details.

3. Have you checked Kudu SCM website errors?

    Check the Kudu SCM website to see if there are any errors in the Event Log at `D:\Logfiles\Eventlog,xml`. This file may contain important information about why the App is not starting.

4. Is your storage account settings configured correctly?

    If your Azure Function app is running on the Consumption plan, check the [Storage account settings documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-recover-storage-account#storage-account-application-settings-deleted).

5. Did you check the Application Insights errors?
   
   Check if you have [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.comazure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring) enabled and check the logs there for any errors. 

6. To get more debug information:

    As a temporary measure, set `fileLoggingMode` to always to get more debug information. The settings are in the `Host.json` and the documentation for each runtime version is in the table below. These logs are available at `D:\home\LogFiles\Application\Functions` in the Kudu -SCM website. There, you'll find a `Host` folder and a `Functions` folder.

    Function Versions	
    Functions 1.x	[V1 Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-host-json-v1#tracing)
    Functions 2.x	[V2 Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-host-json#logging)

    **Note:** For Production, Microsoft recommends setting `fileLoggingMode` to the default of `debugOnly` (versus **Always**).

**Did your app hit these errors?**

1. "Functions runtime is unreachable"

    Visit this [troubleshooting steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-recover-storage-account).

2. "HTTP error" on a HTTP Triggered Function

    If you are receiving these errors, be aware of the following issues:

    - 502 errors: The [HTTP Trigger has certain limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook#trigger---limits),  which may result in 502 errors being logged.
    - 429 errors: HTTP Throttling can be enabled for version 1 of the Functions Runtime and is the default for version 2 of the Functions Runtime. This may be the cause of 429 errors. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook#trigger---hostjson-properties) is more information on how you can configure this.

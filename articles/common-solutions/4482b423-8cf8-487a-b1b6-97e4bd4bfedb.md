# Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
The Face service automatically encrypts your data using Microsoft managed keys.  Your data is secure by default and you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of encryption.

However, you can also manage your subscription with your own encryption keys. Customer-managed keys (CMK), also known as bring your own key (BYOK), offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data.

## **Recommended Steps**

* You must apply to use your own key by completing the [Face Service Customer-Managed Key request Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR3k4-f_9d9xPhWkgOUub9YhUNDZJUERRVVVDME4xNDVNRjEwMTNZV1dHSS4u)

* Once approved to use CMK (please allows 3-5 business days for approval) create a new Face resource making sure to use the **E0 price tier** and the Azure subscription that was approved.

* You must use [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to store your customer-managed keys

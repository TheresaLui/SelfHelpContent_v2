# Azure DevOps Services Assigning Access Levels 

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below

## **Recommended Steps**

*   Where can I manage access levels? 
    *   Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization})
    *   Select **Organization settings**
    *   Select **Users**
    *   See the full how-to article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)
*   How do I find a user's access level? 
    *   Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization})
    *   Select **Organization settings**
    *   Select **Users**
    *   Search for the user and their access level will be next to their name! 
    *   Learn more about managing access levels [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)
*   How do I remove users from Azure DevOps?
    *   Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization})
    *   Select **Organization settings**
    *   Select **Users**
    *   Open the context menu for the user to be removed. Select **Remove from Organization**
    *   Choose **Remove** in the confirmation dialog
    *   Learn more about removing users [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/delete-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)
*   I’ve added a user to my project. Why can’t they access some features? 
    *   There’s a good chance the user is assigned the **Stakeholder** access level. The Stakeholder access level provides **partial** access to features in Azure DevOps, but can be assigned to unlimited users for free. To provide access to more features, the administrator will need to [assign the user Basic or Basic + Test Plans.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops#assign-users-basic-or-basic--test-plans) You can learn more about the different access levels in Azure DevOps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops). 
*   I’ve assigned a user the **Visual Studio Subscription** access level, but it reverts back to **Stakeholder**. Why?
    *   Visual Studio subscribers are entitled to the Azure DevOps features as a subscriber benefit. Azure DevOps will automatically recognize a user’s VS subscription upon log-in. Assigning a user the Visual Studio Subscription access level doesn’t actually purchase a subscription for them; it’s merely a convenience feature for administrators. Therefore, if you assign the **Visual Studio Subscriber** access level to a user without an active subscription, their access level will revert back to **Stakeholder** automatically. You can learn more about Visual Studio Subscriptions in Azure DevOps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#visual-studio-subscription-access)
*   I’m having issues accessing the organization and/or project 
    *   Sign out of your browser. To do so, select the Visual Studio sign out link.
    *   Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del.
    *   Open your browser and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses browser cookies.
    *   Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE
    *   Use a private browser session to retry the connection. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it.

## Common questions

**I added a user to my project. Why can’t they access some features?**
There’s a good chance the user is assigned the **Stakeholder** access level. The Stakeholder access level provides **partial** access to features in Azure DevOps, but can be assigned to unlimited users for free. To provide access to more features, the administrator will need to [assign the user Basic or Basic + Test Plans.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops#assign-users-basic-or-basic--test-plans) 
[Learn more about different access levels in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops). 

**I’ve assigned a user the **Visual Studio Subscription** access level, but it reverts back to **Stakeholder**. Why?**
Visual Studio (VS) subscribers are entitled to the Azure DevOps features as a subscriber benefit. Azure DevOps will automatically recognize a user’s VS subscription upon log-in. Assigning a user the Visual Studio Subscription access level doesn’t purchase a subscription for them; it’s a convenience feature for administrators. Therefore, if you assign the **Visual Studio Subscriber** access level to a user without an active subscription, their access level will automatically revert back to **Stakeholder**. 
[Learn more about Visual Studio Subscriptions in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops#visual-studio-subscription-access).

**I’m having issues accessing the organization and/or project**
Perform the following steps:
    *   Sign out of your browser by selecting the Visual Studio sign out link.
    *   Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del.
    *   Open your browser and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses browser cookies.
    *   Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE
    *   Use a private browser session to retry the connection. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it.
    *   Check out [the guide for troubleshooting connectivity issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/user-guide/troubleshoot-connection?view=azure-devops)

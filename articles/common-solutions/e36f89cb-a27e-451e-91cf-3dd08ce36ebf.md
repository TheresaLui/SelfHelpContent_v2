2. Select the profile in the SQL insights UX and the **Overview** tab will display the a summary view
3. Next select the **Manage profile** tab and you will see the name of the workspace that data is stored in and a list of monitoring VMs associated to the profile
4. If you want to query the raw monitoring data to see the names of the instances and database, select the workspace name and then the Logs view to query the data in the InsightsMetrics table.

# Moving Data Factory across resource groups, subscriptions or tenants

Most users are able to resolve issues concerning moving a data factory across resource groups, subscriptions, or tenants by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To copy or clone a data factory, follow [these directions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/copy-clone-data-factory)
   * As a prerequisite, first you need to create your target data factory from the Azure portal.
   * If you have a Self Hosted Integration Runtime in your source factory, you need to recreate it with the same name in the target factory. 

2. If you've moved Data Factory from one tenant to another, and are now running into issues, try to generate a new managed identity to resolve it. You can use Powershell or the REST API, as described in [Generate service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity#generate-service-identity).

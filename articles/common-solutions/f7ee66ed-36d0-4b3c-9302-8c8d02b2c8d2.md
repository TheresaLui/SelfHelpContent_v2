# A Provider or Target is 'Unavailable' or 'Degraded'

Due to the complexity of quantum hardware, targets may sometimes be offline or may not be performing at their regular capacity. When a target is in this state, the target and/or provider may show as degraded or unavailable.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Ensure that the provider/target combination that you are trying to specify is valid. See the [provider documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/overview-azure-quantum#providers-and-targets) for further details.
- After you have verified that your target/provider combination is valid, revalidate the status, because it may be temporary. 
- If you are trying to use a target that is belongs to a third-party provider, use their support process to inquire about the status of the provider and its targets.
- If you are targeting a Microsoft-owned provider/target combination or you think that the issue you are seeing is caused by the Azure Quantum service itself, open a support case to receive assistance.

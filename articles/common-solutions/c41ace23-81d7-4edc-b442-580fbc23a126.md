# Resource Sets in Purview

Most users are able to resolve issues with resource sets by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

Resource sets are an unique implementation in Purview where we identify patterns and group files with a common naming format. For example, if you have a directory called "foo" and it contains 500 .csv files, Purview scans "foo" and decides that all 500 files are partitions of a single resource set. For cost reasons we do not store information about every individual file in a resource set. It would blow up the catalog requiring us to store literally billions of names that get almost zero usage.

However, in some scenarios, you need to identify the fully qualified name of a specific file that is masked under a resource set. 
1. Browse to the **Resource Set** asset to view `partitionCount`. This represents the number of files/partitions in the resource set. 
2. Note `aggregatedProperties` and `sampleUri`. These pinpoint the fully qualified file name.

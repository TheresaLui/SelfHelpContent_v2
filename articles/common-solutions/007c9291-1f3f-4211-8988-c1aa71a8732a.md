# How can I understand my workspace’s usage?

On the Log Analytics page, the **Usage and estimated costs** has information about your estimated monthly costs based on the last 30 days of usage. Additionally, the chart of billable data volume ingested shows you which solutions account for the most data volume and other trends. From the left navigation pane on your workspace, select **Usage and estimated costs** to see information on your [estimated monthly costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understand-your-usage-and-estimate-costs) based on the last 30 days of usage. 

### **How can I determine which solutions and data types my data is coming from?**

You can run the following query to check which **solutions** and **data types** are the source of your data volumes in the last full day:

```
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(2d)
| where StartTime >= startofday(ago(1d)) and EndTime < startofday(now())
| summarize DataVolumeGB = sum(Quantity)/1000. by Solution, DataTypoe, IsBillable
| sort by Solution asc, DataType asc, IsBillable asc
```

### **How can I tell which computer is generating the most billable data?**

You can run this query to determine the volume of billable data per **computer**:

```
find where TimeGenerated > ago(24h) project _BilledSize, _IsBillable, Computer
| where _IsBillable == true 
| extend computerName = tolower(tostring(split(Computer, '.')[0]))
| summarize BillableDataBytes = sum(_BilledSize) by  computerName 
| sort by BillableDataBytes nulls last
```

### **How can I tell which Azure resource is generating the most billable data?**

You can run this query to determine the volume of billable data per **Azure resource**:

```
find where TimeGenerated > ago(24h) project _ResourceId, _BilledSize, _IsBillable
| where _IsBillable == true 
| summarize BillableDataBytes = sum(_BilledSize) by _ResourceId 
| sort by BillableDataBytes nulls last
```

To learn more about the source of your workspace's data volume, review [these queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understanding-ingested-data-volume).

### **How can I reduce the volume of ingested?**

The methods available to reduce the volume of data ingested depends on the source of the data.  Here is a list of [tips for reducing data volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#tips-for-reducing-data-volume).

# How can I understand my workspace’s usage?

The Log Analytics page 'Usage and estimated costs' has information on your estimated monthly costs based on the last 30 days of usage. Additionally, there is a chart of billable data volume ingested so you can see any trends and information on which solutions account for the most data volume. From your workspace, click 'Usage and estimated costs' on the left navigation pane to see information on your [estimated monthly costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understand-your-usage-and-estimate-costs) based on the last 30 days of usage. 

To learn more about the source of your workspace's data volume, review [these queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#troubleshooting-why-usage-is-higher-than-expected).

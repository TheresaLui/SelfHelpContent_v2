# How can I understand my workspace’s usage?

On the Log Analytics page, the **Usage and estimated costs** has information about your estimated monthly costs based on the last 30 days of usage. Additionally, the chart of billable data volume ingested shows you which solutions account for the most data volume and other trends. From the left navigation pane on your workspace, select **Usage and estimated costs** to see information on your [estimated monthly costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understand-your-usage-and-estimate-costs) based on the last 30 days of usage. 

To learn more about the source of your workspace's data volume, review [these queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#troubleshooting-why-usage-is-higher-than-expected).

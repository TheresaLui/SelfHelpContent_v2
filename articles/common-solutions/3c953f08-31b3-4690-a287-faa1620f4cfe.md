# Unable to delete Confluent Cloud resource

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check if you have enough permissions to delete the resource: [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal)
* Please contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/) if delete does not work for you, despite having the required access. This happens because Confluent has a retention policy for clusters. Confluent Support will delete the Organization and email address for you upon request via support ticket

# High lag when processing streaming events 

High lag times can be caused by different factors, review the steps and documents below to diagnose and solve your issue

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you just connected your environment to an IoT Hub or Event Hub [event source](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/time-series-insights/concepts-streaming-ingestion-event-sources) that has a large queue of events stored, then high initial latency is to be expected as your environment works through processing your events
2. If you're experiencing high lag times after having already connected an event source, check the per-partition throughput rate of your IoT Hub or Event Hub. A single partition should not exceed 0.5 MB/s. Balance the push rate between your partitions to the furthest extent that your solution allows.
3. If you've verified the above and are still experiencing issues, create a new support request

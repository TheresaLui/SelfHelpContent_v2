# The data CPU & Memory doesn’t match with LA

## **Recommended Steps**

This issue occurs when there is throttling or data cap configured for Log Analytics. The chart shows data from the metrics store and inventory, and logs are coming from Log Analytics, so they will register this discrepancy. 

When a customer refreshes the page, the data is populated with Log Analytics, and they will see this discrepancy. The mitigation step here is to update the data cap or to control ingestion to avoid throttling.

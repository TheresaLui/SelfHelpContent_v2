# Issues linking Synapse workspace to Azure ML

To link a Synapse workspace, you must acquire a specific role for the Synapse workspace resource in AAD: **owner role**. (At the very least, the role needs to have "write" permission on **roleAssignments** actions.)

If this requirement isn't met, you may encounter the following error message:
"You do not have permission to link this workspace (missing Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write over this resource). "

## **Recommended Steps**

Do one of the following: 
- Contact your Resource Group Owner to be made an **Owner** of the Synapse workspace resource in the AAD **Access control (IAM)** portal
- Choose a different Synapse workspace

# Cannot create Confluent resource in Azure

Read through the following steps to troubleshoot why your Confluent Cloud resource creation is failing.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If the reason for failure is "Deployment failed," make sure that your Azure subscription is not suspended and that there are no billing issues 

* If the reason for failure is "Conflict," a Confluent Organization was already created using your email account. Try again with a different email account.

**Note:** If you need to use the same email address, contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/). This happens because of Confluent’s retention policy. Confluent Support will delete the Organization and email address for you on request, through a support ticket.

* If the Confluent offer plans are not loading properly, there could be an intermittent issue. Try again later.

* If the deployment process takes more than 3 hours, contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/).

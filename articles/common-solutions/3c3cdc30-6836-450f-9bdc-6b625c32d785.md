# Cannot create Confluent resource in Azure

Read through the steps below to troubleshoot why your Confluent Cloud resource creation is failing.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If the reason for failure is 'DeploymentFailed', the issue could either be with your email or Azure subscription:
	1. Check if the email was previously used for creating a Confluent Cloud resource and retry with a different email account
	2. Ensure your Azure subscription is not suspended and that there are no billing issues

* If the reason for failure is 'Conflict', a Confluent Organization was already created using your email. Please try with a different email account

* If the Confluent offer plans are not loading properly, there could be an intermittent issue. Please retry in some time

* If the deployment process takes more than 3 hours, please contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/)

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Get Started with Confluent Cloud on the Azure Marketplace with Pay As You Go](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/marketplace/ccloud-azure-payg.html)
* [Get Started with Confluent Cloud on the Azure Marketplace with Commitments](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/marketplace/ccloud-azure-ubb.html)

### Notes

* If you need to use the same email address, contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/) to delete your existing resource. Confluent has a retention policy of 30 days to delete the Organization and email address; so even if your previous resource was deleted, it could have been persisted in accordance with this policy

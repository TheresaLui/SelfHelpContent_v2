# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Common questions and issues**

### **What is Azure Active Directory B2C?** 

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day. It takes care of the scaling and safety of the authentication platform, monitoring and automatically handling threats like denial-of-service, password spray, or brute force attacks. [Learn more features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) and [try our demo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview#example-woodgrove-groceries). 

Start today by [creating an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 


### **I am unable to create B2C tenant with error message "the subscription is not registered to use namespace Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory"** 

Add `Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory` as a resource provider for the Azure subscription in use. [Steps to Register resource provider via Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1). 


### **How can I link an Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription?** 

You need to explicitly link an Azure AD B2C tenant to an Azure subscription by creating an Azure AD B2C resource within the target Azure subscription. [Steps to link an Azure AD B2C tenant to a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/billing#create-the-link). 

Start today by [creating an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 

### **Can I unlink one of the Azure AD B2C tenants associated with the current subscription and link it to a new subscription?** 

Yes, this is possible. Follow these steps:
* If the destination subscription exists within the same Azure active directory tenant, open AAD  tenant > **All resources** > **Select Azure B2C tenant** > **Move** > **Move to another subscription**. 

* If the destination subscription is associated with different Azure Active Directory tenants, you can still achieve the same result by unlinking the Azure AD B2C tenant from the source subscription and relinking it to the destination subscription. This method is safe because the only object you delete is the billing link, not the Azure AD B2C tenant itself. 

### **I am having role and access issues in subscription, for my Azure AD B2C tenant** 

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is the authorization system you use to manage access to Azure resources. To grant access, you assign roles to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities at a particular scope. [Steps to add or remove Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

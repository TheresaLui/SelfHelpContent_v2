# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Incident auditing and reporting

Resolve issues with incident auditing and reporting by following these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To see an audit trail of every action (manual or automatic) that occurred on any incident, go to the **Logs** screen and query the **SecurityIncidents** table. 

2. To see metrics on incident handling across your entire SOC, go to the **Main incidents** screen, and review the **SOC efficiency Workbook**.

3. To view the actions taken on a single incident, go to the **Incident** page, and review the **Incident Overview Workbook**.

4. To learn more about the **SecurityIncidents** table, and incident auditing and reporting, see [Manage SOC with incident metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/manage-soc-with-incident-metrics).

# How can I protect myself from unexpected large data ingestion?

To protect yourself from large unexpected data volumes and costs, you can configure a [daily cap](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#manage-your-maximum-daily-data-volume) to limit the daily ingestion for your workspace. A daily cap can help you stay within your limit by managing unexpected increases in data volume from your managed resources and unplanned charges for your workspace. Be aware, however, that when the daily cap is met, you lose data for the remainder of the day. Therefore, your goal should not be to hit the daily limit. It can also impact your ability to observe and receive alerts for the health conditions of resources that support IT services. </br></br>

Use the following procedure to configure a limit to manage the volume of data that Log Analytics workspace ingests per day.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Select **Usage and estimated costs** from the left pane in your workspace. 
1. On the **Usage and estimated costs** page for the selected workspace, select **Daily Cap** from the top of the page. 
1. Select **ON** to enable the daily cap, and then set the data volume limit in GB/day. Note that security data types are not affected by the daily cap.
1. To be notified when the daily cap has been met, [configure an alert](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#alert-when-daily-cap-reached).</br>

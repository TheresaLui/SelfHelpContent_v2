# Access Restrictions         

The following steps will help you to successfully set up access restrictions.

## **Recommended Steps**

Keep the following elements in mind when setting up access restrictions rules:
1. The name of the rule cannot be more than 32 characters.
2. There is a limit of 512 rows of IP or service-endpoint restrictions. If you require more than 512 rows of restrictions, consider installing a standalone security product, such as Azure Front Door, Azure App Gateway, or a WAF.
3. If IPV6 addresses are getting restricted, it indicates that requests are coming over service endpoint. For these scenarios, allow traffic for the respective subnet.

# Kubernetes Cluster management

After the Kubernetes cluster is created, then you can connect to and manage the cluster locally from a client machine through a native tool such as `kubectl`. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Make sure you have access to an Azure Stack Edge device
2.	Activate your Azure Stack Edge device 
3.	Enable the **Compute** role on the device. This creates a virtual switch on the enabled port. When IOT Edge is enabled, A Kubernetes cluster is created on the device. Your IOT module is deployed on top of the Kubernetes cluster.   
4.	Ensure that there is access to a Windows client system running PowerShell 5.0 or later, in order to access the device. Alternatively, you can use any other client with a supported operating system.
5.	Ensure that the Kubernetes API endpoint is from the device page of your local web UI.

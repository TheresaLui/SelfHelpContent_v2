# Modules or downstream devices are not receiving twin data, direct methods, or messages.

Most users are able to resolve their connection issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Update to the latest version of IoT Edge Runtime. See [how to upgrade the IoT Edge runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-update-iot-edge).
2. Update the SDK version in your device or module software to the latest LTS.
3. Turn on debug logs for the IoT Edge hub to determine if the module is seeing activity. See [View the messages going through the IoT Edge hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#view-the-messages-going-through-the-iot-edge-hub).
4. Check the module or device logs to ensure that they're connected to IoT Edge. This may be a good time to [get a support bundle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#gather-debug-information-with-support-bundle-command). You can acquire module logs by using `iotedge logs`.

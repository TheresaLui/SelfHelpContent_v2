# Modules or downstream devices are not receiving twin data or direct methods.

Most users are able to resolve their twin issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Update to latest IoT Edge Runtime, See [how to upgrade the IoT Edge runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-update-iot-edge)
2. Update SDK version in your device or module software to latest LTS
3. Turn on debug logs for the IoT Edge hub to see if the module is seeing activity. For more information, see [View the messages going through the IoT Edge hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#view-the-messages-going-through-the-iot-edge-hub). 
4. Check the module or device logs to ensure it is connected to IoT Edge. This may be a good time to [get a support bundle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#gather-debug-information-with-support-bundle-command). Module logs may be acquired using `iotedge logs`.

# Request for more information on Malware detection

Most questions on malware detection can be answered by the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) supports malware detection for the following apps: Box, Dropbox, G-Suite, Office 365 (requires a valid license for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1)

* Malware detection is a built-in policy that is disabled by default. To enable malware detection, go to the policy page in the Azure portal.

* Files that were matched as malware from Microsoft Defender for Office canâ€™t be governed (including quarantine) in MCAS.

* If a user [authorizes a file that was matched as malware](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/file-filters#authorizing-files), it won't be matched as malware again.

# I can't see my malware detection in the alerts page or I need more information about malware alerts

Most users are able to resolve malware detections issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you can't see your malware detection alerts on the alerts page, make sure that:
    1. You're using one of the following supported apps: Box, Dropbox, G-Suite, Office 365. (Office 365 requires a valid license for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1.)
	1. You have enabled the built-in malware detection policy, which is disabled by default. To enable malware detection, in the Cloud App Security portal, go to the policy page, and enable the malware detection policy.

1. If you are unable to apply govenance actions to files detected as malware by Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you need to authorize the file in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

1. If a file is not detected as malware, check that the file was not [previously authorized in Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/file-filters#authorizing-files). If you have identified the authorized file as malware, continue to open the support ticket.

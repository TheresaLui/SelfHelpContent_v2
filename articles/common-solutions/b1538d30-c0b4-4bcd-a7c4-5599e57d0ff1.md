# Managing multiple custom forms

With Form Recognizer, you must train a different model for each template you are trying to recognize. For example, if you have two suppliers that use radically different templates for their shipping confirmation docs, you will train two different models, even if you are trying to extract the same key value pairs from both templates.

## **Recommended Documents**
In the [v2.1 preview of Form Recognizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/whats-new#august-2020), there is a [new feature called Model Compose](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool?tabs=v2-1#compose-trained-models), which can help with managing multiple models. With Model Compose, you can compose up to 100 models to a single model ID. When you call Analyze with this composed model ID, Form Recognizer will first classify the form you submitted, matching it to the best matching model, and then return results for that model. This is useful when incoming forms may belong to one of several templates.

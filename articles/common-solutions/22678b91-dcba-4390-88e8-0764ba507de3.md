# Migrate from TFS

### **Before Migration**
To start your migration to the Azure DevOps Services, review the [Migration Guide](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/migrate-tfs-vsts). This guide provides an overview of the entire process and information about where to download the **TFSMigrator.exe** file, which handles the client-side migration process. 

Next, review these resources:
* [Details and Constantly updated documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/articles/migration-overview)
* One of our developers created a video walkthrough of the entire process: [Migrate from TFS to Team Services with the TFS Database Import Service](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017/T185)

### **During Migration**
The data migration tool flags errors that you need to correct prior to performing a migration to Azure DevOps Services. 
 Select the appropriate problem and solution in the next section, and complete all of the steps before creating a support ticket. If you do need to create a ticket after completing the diagnostic steps, provide information about the path you took and the results of the steps you ran to expedite the resolution of your problem.

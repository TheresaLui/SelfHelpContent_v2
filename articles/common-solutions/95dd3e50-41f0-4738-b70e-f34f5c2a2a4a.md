# A Provider is not available in a particular region

Not every provider is available in every Azure region where Azure Quantum is available. To see if a provider is available in your desired region, follow the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To check if your desired provider is available in your region, see [provider documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Azure-Quantum-provider) 

   **Note:** If you're trying to add a third-party provider, consider contacting them directly for more details regarding availability in the desired region

2. If you're using the CLI, verify that the provider/target combination that you are requesting is valid
3. If you're unsure, deploy a workspace in the desired region to see if the provider is available to select there

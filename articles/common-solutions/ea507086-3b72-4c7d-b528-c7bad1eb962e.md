# Setup,Licensing, and Patching
 
 Most users are able to resolve their installation issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Where can I find the installation media or the license key in an Azure SQL VM?**

    * If you already have a SQL Server VM created from Azure Marketplace, find the installation media at **C:\SQLServerFull**<br>
    * To get the product key, run **setup.exe** from **C:\SQLServerFull**, copy the product key that appears in the install process, and exit the installer

* **Cannot start SQL or Analysis Service**
    1. Check if you installed the SQL Server evaluation version. If yes, you can deploy another SQL VM with the Standard/Enterprise version and copy the setup file from **C:\SQLServerFull** to the current machine
    1. You can then run the [Edition Upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/change-sql-server-edition) and start the service
    
* **Error: "The folder path specified is invalid. Please enter a valid folder path" on the Analysis Services Configuration tab**

    Make sure that you used the correct valid path to install SSAS and that the account you used has sufficient [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/configure-service-accounts-analysis-services?view=asallproducts-allversions) for installation.
    
## **Recommended Documents**

* [Install SQL Server Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/install-windows/install-analysis-services?view=asallproducts-allversions)
* [Install Analysis Services in Power Pivot Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/install-windows/install-analysis-services-in-power-pivot-mode?view=asallproducts-allversions)
* [Post-install configuration (Analysis Services)](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/post-install-configuration-analysis-services?view=asallproducts-allversions)

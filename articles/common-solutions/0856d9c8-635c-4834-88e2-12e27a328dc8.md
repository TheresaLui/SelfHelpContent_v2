# Access Restriction

## **Recommended Steps**

Follow these guidelines when you're setting up access restrictions rules:
* The name of the rule cannot be more than 32 characters.
* There is a limit of 512 rows of IP or service-endpoint restrictions. If you require more than 512 rows of restrictions, consider installing a standalone security product, such as Azure Front Door, Azure App Gateway, or a WAF.
* If IPV6 addresses are getting restricted, it indicates that requests are coming over service endpoint. For these scenarios, allow traffic for the respective subnet.

# Connector Unexpected Behavior or Errors

Resolve unexpected behavior or errors in Connector using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**
* If Connector throws an error or exception code, start by validating whether the error is in the [Copy Activity errors documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-troubleshoot-guide). This article contains most common errors from different data sources and actions to resolve them.

* If this is a transient issue, such as an instable network connection, add `retry` to your [activity policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities#activity-policy).

* Review the specific connectorâ€™s document from [Data Store connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-overview?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#supported-data-stores-and-formats) for more details.  If error or exception is thrown from 3rd party driver (ODBC Connector), please review documents from 3rd party.

* If you use **Self-Hosted IR**, follow the steps in the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide#gather-self-hosted-integration-runtime-logs-from-azure-data-factory).

* For errors on the most commonly associated data sources and sinks, review the following error troubleshooting guides:
   * [SQL connector common errors and troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-troubleshoot-guide#azure-sql-data-warehouseazure-sql-databasesql-server)

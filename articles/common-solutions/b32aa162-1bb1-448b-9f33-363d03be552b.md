### **Frequently Asked Questions**

* **What file types support multi-turn conversation?**
Multi-turn follow-up prompts are extracted from the hierarchy present in the documents. You can also [create your own file in this format](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/reference-document-format-guidelines#multi-turn-document-formatting). 

* **Can multi-turn support going back to the parent in the same tree?**
Currently, if you reach below in the hierarchy, then there is no way we can keep the context of the parents. You can handle this by adding metadata tags, using these tags as a strict filter for each hierarchy or tree. 

* **How does the multi-turn work?**

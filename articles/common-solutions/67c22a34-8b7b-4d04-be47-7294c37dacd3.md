Learn more about reducing vulnerabilities by reviewing the following documents.

## **Recommended Steps**
There is built-in security scanning that is always enabled: [Microsoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-antimalware).<br>

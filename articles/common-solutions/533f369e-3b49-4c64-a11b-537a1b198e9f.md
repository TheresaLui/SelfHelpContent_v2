# Device Alerts

Alerts proactively notify you when issues are found with your device using your monitoring data in Azure Monitor. 

You can create three types of alert notification rules for an Azure Stack Edge device: 
1. Metrics alerts notify you when one of your metrics crosses a threshold
2. Activity log alerts notify you when a new activity log event occurs that matches the conditions you specify in the alert rule
2. Device events based alerts notify you when there are any device health-related issues

In addition, choose whether you're notified by email, SMS, or a webhook action in the action group associated with the alert rule.  



## **Recommended Steps**

Create an alert rule using the following steps:
1. Add additional permissions. See [troubleshooting documentation for permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-troubleshoot-metric#no-permissions-to-create-metric-alert-rules).
2. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource, and go to **Monitoring** > **Alerts**
3. To create metrics-based alerts, select **+ New alert rule** and see [Learn how to create metric alerts in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric)
4. To create activity log-based alerts, select **+ New alert rule** and see [Learn how to create activity log alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-activity-log)
5. To create alert notifications based on device events, use Action rules. Select **Manage actions** > **Action rules (preview)**. For more information, see [Learn how to create action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-action-rules?tabs=portal#configuring-an-action-rule) and [Alert Notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-device-event-alert-notifications)

# Device Alerts

Alerts proactively notify you when issues are found with your device using your monitoring data in Azure Monitor. 

You can create three types of alert notification rules for an Azure Stack Edge device: 
1. Metrics alerts provides a way to be notified when one of your metrics crosses a threshold.
2. Activity log alerts provides a way to be notified when a new activity log event occurs that matches the conditions specified in the alert rule.
2. Device events based alerts provides a way to be notified when there are any device health related issues.

You can choose whether you want to be notified by email, SMS, or a webhook action in the action group associated with the alert rule.

To create a alert rule, use the following steps:

## **Recommended Steps**
1. You need additional permissions. See [troubleshooting documentation for permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-troubleshoot-metric#no-permissions-to-create-metric-alert-rules).
2. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource and then go to **Monitoring** > **Alerts**. 
3. To create metrics based alerts, click **+ New alert rule** and see [Learn how to create metric alerts in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric).
4. To create activity log based alerts, click **+ New alert rule** and see [Learn how to create activity log alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-activity-log)
5. To create alert notifications based on device events, use Action rules. Select **Manage actions** and select **Action rules (preview)**. For more information, see [Learn how to create action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-action-rules?tabs=portal#configuring-an-action-rule).

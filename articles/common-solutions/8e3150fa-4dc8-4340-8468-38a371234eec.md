# I can't figure out how to enable VM guest health


## **Recommended Steps**
The virtual machine must run on [operating systems and in regions supported by VM guest health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell#current-limitations). You can enable VM guest health using the Azure portal and Resource Manager Template.
 
**Enable a virtual machine using the Azure portal**<br>
When you enable guest health for a virtual machine in the Azure portal, all required configuration is performed for you. From the **Get Started** view in Azure Monitor for VMs, select the link next to the upgrade message for a virtual machine, and then select **Upgrade**. You can also select multiple virtual machines to upgrade them together.
 
**Enable a virtual machine using Resource Manager template**<br>
Enabling virtual machines using Azure Resource Manager requires the following three steps:<br>
1. Create a data collection rule.
2. Install the guest health extension on each virtual machine.
3. Create an association between the virtual machine and the data collection rule.<br>
   Refer to our documentation for the [template file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell#enable-a-virtual-machine-using-resource-manager-template). For more information, review [enabling VM guest health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell).

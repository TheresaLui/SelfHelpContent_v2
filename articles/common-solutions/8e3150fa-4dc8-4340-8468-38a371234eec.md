## **Recommended Steps**
The virtual machine must run on the [operating systems and installed in the regions supported by VM guest health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell#current-limitations). You can enable VM guest health using the Azure Portal and Resource Manager Template
 
Enable a virtual machine using the Azure portal
When you enable guest health for a virtual machine in the Azure portal, all required configuration is performed for you. From the Get Started view in Azure Monitor for VMs, click the link next to the upgrade message for a virtual machine, and then click the Upgrade button. You can also select multiple virtual machines to upgrade them together.
 
Enable a virtual machine using Resource Manager template
There are three steps required to enable virtual machines using Azure Resource Manager.
•	Create a data collection rule.
•	Install the guest health extension on each virtual machine
•	Create an association between the virtual machine and the data collection rule.
Refer to our documentation for the [template file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell#enable-a-virtual-machine-using-resource-manager-template) and more information on [enabling VM guest health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-enable?tabs=powershell).

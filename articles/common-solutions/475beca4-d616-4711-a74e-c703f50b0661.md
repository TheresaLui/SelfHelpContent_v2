# Log Analytics data export.

Most users are able to resolve common issues around Log Analytics data export to a storage account or an event hub using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Can't configure export via UI or PowerShell
  * Data export is supported in CLI and REST currently, but we are planning to support configuration in UI and PowerShell.
  
* Table was configured in export rule but no data is exported to destination
   * Verify that the tables you want to export are [supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/logs-data-export?tabs=portal#supported-tables)
   * Export rules take effect about 15 minutes after configuration. The export operates on newly ingested data. If you need to query old data in your workspace, you can [Invoke a one time export](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQueryExport) using a PowerShell script, or [query data using Logic App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/logs-export-logic-app).
   * Verify that the **Microsoft.Insights** [resource provider is registered for your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/logs-data-export?tabs=portal#register-resource-provider)
   * If your storage account is in vNet, you need to [add an exception](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/logs-data-export?tabs=portal#allow-trusted-microsoft-services) to allow Azure Monitor to write to the account

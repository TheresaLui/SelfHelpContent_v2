# I'm unable to configure bandwidth schedules 

Bandwidth schedules let you configure network bandwidth usage across multiple time-of-day schedules. These schedules can be applied to the upload and download operations from your device to the cloud.

You can also increase the Data box gateway disk capacity. Data volume can be increased upto 5 Tb.

You can add, modify, or delete the bandwidth schedules for your Data Box Gateway through the Azure Portal.

## **Recommended Steps**

- The bandwidth can be set to as low as 20 Mbps in connected mode. We recommend 20 Mbps for control plane management and monitoring data flow.

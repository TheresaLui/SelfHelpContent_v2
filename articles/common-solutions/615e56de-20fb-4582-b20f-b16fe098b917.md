# Unable to configure a trigger

Events are raised when an action is required from you, either on your device or within Azure. For example, when a file is created in a share, it is an event. Triggers raise events. For your Azure Stack Edge, triggers can be in response to file events or a schedule.

## **Recommended Steps**

*   Verify the steps to configure a trigger. See [Trigger setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-deploy-configure-compute)
*   Make sure that you give the trigger a unique name

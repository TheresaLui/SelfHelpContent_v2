# Trigger management

Events are things that happen within your cloud environment or on your device that you might want to take action on. For example, when a file is created in a share, it is an event. Triggers raise the events. For your Azure Stack Edge, triggers can be in response to file events or a schedule.

## **Recommended Steps**

*	Select from File or Schedule. A file trigger fires whenever a file event occurs such as a file is written to the input share. A scheduled trigger fires up based on a schedule defined by you.
*	You can add File triggers or Scheduled triggers  
*	Make sure you give a unique name for the trigger

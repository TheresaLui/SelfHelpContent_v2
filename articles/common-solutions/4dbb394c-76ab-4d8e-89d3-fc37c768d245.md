#  ADF limits and how to increase them

Azure Data Factory is a multi-tenant service that has the following default limits in place to make sure that customer subscriptions are protected from each other's workloads. For increasing ADF limits, you may contact support. In ourexperience, we have found that you can optimize your pipeline design to stay within limits and manage your cost.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Review [ADF limits](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/includes/azure-data-factory-limits.md)
2. If you need to increase the limits despite optimizations, please contact support.

#  ADF limits and how to increase them

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a multi-tenant service. To ensure that customer subscriptions are protected from each other's workloads, ADF has limits in place, by default. To increase ADF limits, contact support. In our experience, we have found that you can optimize your pipeline design to stay within limits and manage your costs.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Review [ADF limits](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/includes/azure-data-factory-limits.md)
2. Review Azure Data Factory limits at [Data Factory Limits](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/includes/azure-data-factory-limits.md)
3. Some default limits can be increased as per [Customer Request](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-limits-quotas-increase-requests/) 


## **Recommended Documents**

* [Data Factory Limits (see Version 2 section)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#data-factory-limits)
* [Azure Service Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)
* [ADF FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/frequently-asked-questions)
* [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)

### **Notes**

- Some limits, including bytes per object for pipeline objects, cannot be increased above the default.
- If you reach the bytes-per-object for pipeline objects limit, we recommend that you split the pipeline into several smaller pipelines.

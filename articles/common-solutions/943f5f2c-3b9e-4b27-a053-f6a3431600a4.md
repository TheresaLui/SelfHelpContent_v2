# Cannot access TSI environment via the Explorer 

Most users are able to resolve their access issue using the steps below:

## **Recommended Steps**

* Verify that the principal needing access has been granted either the Reader or Contributor role by navigating to the environment overview page in the Azure portal and clicking on Data Access Policies under Settings
    * Note that the Data Access Policies for your environment are separate from Access control (IAM) settings, be sure you're on the correct blade
    * Note that if the environment was deployed via an ARM template, the principal that triggered the deployment will not be granted access automatically, but you are able to specify a user, service, or group object ID and their role in the [resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.timeseriesinsights/environments/accesspolicies) section of your ARM template
* Verify that the correct directory is selected in the upper right corner of the Explorer
* Submit a support ticket if you're still experiencing issues after following the steps the above

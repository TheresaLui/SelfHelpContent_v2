# Sign-in account selection
Most users are able to resolve their issues with respect to sign-in using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**
* Before you create a support request, please check if there is an outage going on at [Azure DevOps Services Status](https://status.dev.azure.com)
* Want a quicker answer? For quick answers to common questions and issues, try the [Azure DevOps Virtual Agent](https://azuredevopsvirtualagent.azurewebsites.net/)

As a first step in resolving any connectivity issues with Azure DevOps, complete the following steps: 

* [Sign out from Azure DevOps completely](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signout). This will sign out all active sessions from the browser.
* Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del.
* Open Internet Explorer and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies. 
* Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE (If you are using it). If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it.
* Close the browser and open a new one in in-private/incognito mode
* [Log in](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/profile/view) with your credentials
* If you have signed in with your **personal account (Microsoft account)**, you will see 'Microsoft account' in the left side drop down
* If you have signed in with your **work account**, you will see the name of the Azure AD tenant that you signed into in the left side drop down
* You will also see list of Azure DevOps organizations that this account has access to. Follow the link to your desired organization.  

**I am unable to access the desired Azure DevOps organization with my personal account. Why?** 

The most plausible reasons are:

  1. You may not have access to that organization. If that is the case, you can reach out to the organization owner to get access. 
  2. The organization you are trying to access is connected to Azure AD tenant and only accepts work accounts. If that is the case, you can follow the steps given above to sign out and sign in with your work account. 

**I am unable to access the desired Azure DevOps organization with my work account. Why?** 
The most plausible reasons are:

  1. You may not have access to that organization. If that is the case, you can reach out to the organization owner to get access. 
  2. The organization you are trying to access only accepts personal accounts (Microsoft account). If that is the case, you can follow the steps given above to sign out and sign in with your personal account. 

**Do you have two accounts (work and personal) with the same address (e.g. jdoe@contoso.com for personal and jdoe@contoso.com for work) and unable to access an organization using this?** 

* See if you have [chosen the right account](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/profile/view) (work or personal) during sign in
* If you see 'Microsoft account' in the left side drop down, then you have signed in with your personal account. To switch accounts, follow the steps above to sign out completely and select the work account to sign-in back.
* If you see your Azure AD tenant name (e.g. contoso) in the left side drop down, then you have signed in with your work account. To switch accounts, follow the steps above to sign out completely and select the personal account to sign-in back.

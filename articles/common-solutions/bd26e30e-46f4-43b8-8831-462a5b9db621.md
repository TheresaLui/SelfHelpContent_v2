# Localization and Language Settings


### **Frequently Asked Questions**

* **How do I change the language setting for my Knowledge Base?**

The current GA model supports one language per service, which means the language that you choose when you create the Knowledge Base for the first time. Currently, QnA Maker is in public preview. This feature will let you make the language setting specific to the Knowledge Base instead of to the service. For more information about QnA Maker, see the following link.

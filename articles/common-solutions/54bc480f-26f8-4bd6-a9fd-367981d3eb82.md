# Phone number subscription eligibility 

Most often, users cannot obtain a phone number through the portal or APIs because their subscriptions are not eligible. 

## **Recommended Steps**

Determine whether your subscription meets the requirements listed in our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/telephony-sms/plan-solution#azure-subscriptions-eligibility).
* The subscription must have a US-based billing address.
* The subscription must be a paid subscription; it cannot be a free trial account or use Azure credits.

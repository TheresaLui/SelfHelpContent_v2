# Issues with PowerShell 

Most users can resolve issues with PowerShell, including subscription and authorization issues, and not being able to edit target settings, by following the information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Subscription and authorization issues

1. Ensure that you have Owner or User Access Administrator permissions for the subscription
2. Register the resource provider Microsoft.Migrate, so that the MoveCollection resource can be created
3. Set the subscription ID, retrieve the identity principle of the MoveCollection object, and assign the Azure roles to it

### Unable to edit target settings using PowerShell

1. You can't currently edit any target region settings. Modify these settings directly by using the Azure Portal.

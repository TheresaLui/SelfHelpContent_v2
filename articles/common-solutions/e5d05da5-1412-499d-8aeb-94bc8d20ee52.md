# Activation Key

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the device has been reset, it must be activated against a new management resource. You can't use the old management resource to manage a device that has been reset.
2. Check the network connectivity between your Azure Stack Edge device and Azure. This is required for the activation to succeed.

**Notes:**
- An activation key cannot be reused once it has already been used to activate a device
- The activation key expires after three days. Once expired it will have to be regenerated.

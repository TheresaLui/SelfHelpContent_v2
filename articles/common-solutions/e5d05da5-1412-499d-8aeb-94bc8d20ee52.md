# Activation Key

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the device has been reset, it needs to be activated against a new management resource. You cannot use the old management resource to manage a device that has been reset.
2. Check the network connectivity between your Azure Stack Edge device and Azure. This is required in order for the activation to succeed.
3. An activation key cannot be reused once it has already been used to activate a device
4. The activation key expires after three days. Once expired it will have to be regenerated.

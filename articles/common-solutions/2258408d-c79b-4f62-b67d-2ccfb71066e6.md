# Unable to create or delete a Data Factory

Most users are able to resolve issues regarding creating or deleting a data factory by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* There are several ways to create data factory. See the [Quick Start](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction) and explore the options in the left column.
   For example, this is a link to [Create a Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal) using the Azure portal. 

* Data Factory UI is currently supported only in **Microsoft Edge** and **Google Chrome** web browsers.

* If you don't have an **Azure subscription**, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

* To create and manage child resources for Azure Data Factory (including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes in the Azure portal), you must have the **Data Factory Contributor** role at the **Resource Group** level or above. For more information, see [Roles and requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#roles-and-requirements).

* To have greater access control for ADF portal users, consider creating a separate resource group for your data factory

* To grant resource level roles and access to different data factory users, create a **Custom** role. See [Custom scenarios and custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#custom-scenarios-and-custom-roles).

* If you moved Data Factory from one tenant to another and are having issues, try generating a **new managed identity.** To do this, you can use PowerShell or the REST API. For more information, see [Generate service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#generate-service-identity).

Note: Resource Manager template deployment with the Data Factory Contributor role does not elevate your permissions.

* After you create data factory, you can delete it from the Azure portal by using the **Delete** button.
* You can also delete data factories by using the [REST API]( https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/datafactory/factories/delete).

**This Data Factory name is not available** 

The Data Factory name is *unique across Microsoft Azure*. If you see this error, change the name of the data factory and try creating again. For naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see the [Data Factory - naming rules](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/data-factory/naming-rules) article.

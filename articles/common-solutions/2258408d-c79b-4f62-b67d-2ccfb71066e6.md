# Unable to create or delete a Data Factory

Most users are able to resolve issues regarding creating or deleting a data factory by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* There are several ways to create data factory. See the [Quick Start](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction) and explore the options in the left column.
   For example, this is a link to [Create a Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal) using the Azure portal. Please note that currently, Data Factory UI is supported only in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome web browsers.
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
 *  See the [Roles and Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions#roles-and-requirements) to know about the roles and permissions required to create data factory instances and manage resources.
 * Make sure you have the storage account created. If not, [create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).
 *  For Resource group, select an existing one or create a new one. It is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. 
 *  The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization. See [Resource groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups).
* After you create data factory, you can delete it from the Azure portal by using the **Delete** button.
* You can also delete data factories by using the [REST API]( https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/datafactory/factories/delete).

**This Data Factory name is not available** 

The Data Factory name is *unique across Microsoft Azure*. If you see this error, change the name of the data factory and try creating again. For naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see the [Data Factory - naming rules](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/data-factory/naming-rules) article.

## **Recommended Steps**

* There are several ways to create data factory. See the [Quick Start](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction) and explore the options in the left column.
   For example, this is a link to [Create a Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal) using the Azure portal.

* After you create data factory, you can delete it from the Azure portal by using the **Delete** button.
* You can also delete data factories by using the [REST API]( https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/datafactory/factories/delete).

# EdegArm credentials

Azure Resource Manager provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. The Azure Stack Edge device supports the same Azure Resource Manager APIs to create, update, and delete VMs in a local subscription. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Use the `Add-AzureRmEnvironment` cmdlet to further ensure that the communication via Azure Resource Manager is working properly and the API calls are going through the port dedicated for Azure Resource Manager - 443.
2.	The `Add-AzureRmEnvironment` cmdlet adds endpoints and metadata to enable Azure Resource Manager cmdlets to connect with a new instance of Azure Resource Manager.
3.	Set the environment as Azure Stack Edge Pro and the port to be used for Azure Resource Manager calls as 443. 
4.	Call local device APIs to authenticate the connections to Azure Resource Manager.

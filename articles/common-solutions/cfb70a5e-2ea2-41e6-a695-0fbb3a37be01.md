# Create Storage Account

After configuring the shares, provide a Storage account where the share lives. A container is created in the storage account with the share name if the container already does not exist. If the container already exists, then the existing container is used. From the dropdown list, choose the Storage service from block blob, page blob, or files. The type of the service chosen depends on which format you want the data to reside in Azure. For example, in this instance, we want the data to reside as block blobs in Azure, hence we select Block Blob. If choosing Page Blob, you must ensure that your data is 512 bytes aligned. Use Page blob for VHDs or VHDX that are always 512 bytes aligned.

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Your device is associated with a storage account that's used as a destination for your data in Azure. Access to the storage account is controlled by the subscription and two 512-bit storage access keys associated with that storage account.
2.	One of the keys is used for authentication when the Azure Stack Edge device accesses the storage account. The other key is held in reserve, so you can rotate the keys periodically.
3.	For security reasons, many datacenters require key rotation. We recommend that you follow these best practices for key rotation: Your storage account key is similar to the root password for your storage account. Carefully protect your account key. Don't distribute the password to other users, hard code it, or save it anywhere in plain text that's accessible to others.

### Notes

* Make sure that the Azure Storage account that you use does not have immutability policies set on it if you are using it with a Azure Stack Edge or Data Box Gateway device

# Azure Sentinel - Workbooks - Issues with workbooks templates

Use the following procedure to edit or get to the underlying queries of an existing workbook.

## **Recommended Steps** 

1. Make sure that the required data type is connected.

2. Open the template. Use filters to control the data being presented, as needed.

3. Select **Save**, and then select the location where you want to save the JSON file for the template. <br>
   **Note:** This creates an Azure resource based on the relevant template and saves the JSON file of the workbook and not the data.
		
4. Select **View saved workbook** and select the **Edit** button at the top. <br>
   You can now edit the workbook and customize it according to your needs. 
		
5. To access a certain underlying query, select the **Edit** button that is below the visual.

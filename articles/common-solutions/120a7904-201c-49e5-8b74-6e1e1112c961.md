# Azure Sentinel - Workbooks - Issues with workbooks templates

Resolve issues with workbooks templates in Azure Sentinel using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps** 

Use the following procedure to edit or get to the underlying queries of an existing workbook.

1. Make sure that the required data type is connected.
2. Open the template. Use filters to control the data being presented, if needed.
3. To edit a workbook or access the underlying queries, do the following: 
	1. Select **Save**, and then select the location where you want to save the JSON file for the template. <br>
	**Note:** This creates an Azure resource based on the relevant template and saves the JSON file of the workbook and not the data.
		
	2. Select **View saved workbook** and select the **Edit** button at the top. <br>
	   You can now edit the workbook and customize it according to your needs. 
		
	3. To access a certain underlying query, select the **Edit** button that is below the visual.

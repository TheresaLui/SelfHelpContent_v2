# Azure Sentinel - Workbooks - Issues with workbooks templates

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you want to edit or get to the underlying queries of an existing workbook:
    1. Make sure that the required data type is connected.
	2. Open template, use filters to control the data that is presented, if applicable.
	3. To edit a Workbook or access the underlying queries: 
		1. Select Save, and then select the location where you want to save the JSON file for the template. 
		Note: This creates an Azure resource based on the relevant template and saves the JSON file of the workbook and not the data.
		2. Select View saved workbook. Then, click the Edit button at the top. You can now edit the workbook and customize it according to your needs. 
		To access a certain underlying query, click on the Edit button that is below the visual.

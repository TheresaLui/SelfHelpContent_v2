# Device hardware specifications do not match

Hardware specifications of the device delivered to me are different from the one that I ordered.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Go to the Overview of the your Azure Stack Edge resource and expand the "Essentials" on top to check the "Model" field. This is the exact configuration of the device that you have ordered.
2. If the device that was delivered to you is not same as this Model, log a support ticket to get a resolution
3. If you incorrectly ordered this Model and would like to replace the device, raise a return request using instructions given in below links

## **Recommended Documents**

# Device hardware specifications do not match

The hardware specifications of the device that was delivered to me are different from the one I ordered.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Go to the **Overview** of the Azure Stack Edge resource, and expand **Essentials** to check the **Model** field.<br>
   This is the exact configuration of the device you ordered.
   
2. Do one of the following:
   - If the device that was delivered to you is not same as this model, log a support ticket to get a resolution
   - If you incorrectly ordered this model and would like to replace the device, initiate a return request using the instructions in **Recommended Documents**. 

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Request to return the device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-return-device)

# Validate dependencies

Most users can resolve issues regarding validating dependencies, modifying target settings, and configuring availability sets for VMs, by following the information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Azure Resource Mover verifies resource dependencies and checks dependent resources 

1. Learn how to [validate dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-mover/about-move-process)
3. If validation shows that resources are pending, go ahead and add them. Continue validating resources until there are no additional resources to be added.
4. Ensure that you add all the dependent resources, even if you don't want to move them. You can later specify that the resources you're moving will use different resources in the target region.
5. Ensure that the source and the target resources region match the move collection source and target region, respectively

### Modify target settings

- Learn how to [modify target settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-mover/modify-target-settings)
  - We recommend changing target settings only after the move collection is validated
  - We recommend modifying settings before you prepare the resources because some target properties might be unavailable for edit after prepare is complete

- For SQL resources:
  - SQL DBs: We recommend modifying target configuration settings before you perform the "Prepare" operation
  * SQL Elastic Pool: We recommend modifying target configuration settings before you initiate the move

## Issues with availability set configuration

- Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a default domain by the underlying Azure platform. There is no configurable property for a VM or availability set that enables you to set a specific fault and domain account for a VM.

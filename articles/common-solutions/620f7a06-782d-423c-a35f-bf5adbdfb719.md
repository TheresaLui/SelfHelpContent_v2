# Validate dependencies

Azure Resource Mover verifies resource dependencies, and checks whether dependent resources are added


## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Validate dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-mover/about-move-process)
3. If validation shows that resources are pending, go ahead and add them. Please validate again until there are no outstanding resources to be added
4. Ensure to add all dependent resources, even if you don't want to move them. You can later specify that the resources you're moving should use different resources in the target region.
5. Please ensure that source and target resources region matches that of the move collection source and target region respectively

## Modify target setting 

Following these steps, most customers are able to resolve issues during modifying target settings, when moving resources across Azure regions

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Modify target settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-mover/modify-target-settings)
- It's recommended that you only change target settings after the move collection is validated

- It's recommended that you modify settings before preparing the resources, because some target properties might be unavailable for edit after prepare is complete
2. For SQL resources:

- SQL DBs: It's recommended that you modify target configuration settings before you "Prepare"

- SQL Elastic Pool: It's recommended that you modify target configuration settings anytime before "Initiate Move"

## Issues with Availability Set configuration

1. Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform.
There is no configurable property for a VM or availability set which allows to set a specific fault and domain account for a VM.
2. [Configure VMs in availability set](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability#configure-multiple-virtual-machines-in-an-availability-set-for-redundancy)

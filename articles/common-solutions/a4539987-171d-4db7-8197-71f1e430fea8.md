# Not sure why I ran out of quota

## **Recommended Steps**

**Common reasons for hitting 403 quota errors include:**
* If you are using the Free (F0) SKUs of Cognitive Services, there's a monthly quota for the number of calls that can be made. If you've hit this monthly quota and are receiving 403 errors, you have two options:
  * The 403 error for a Free resource will reset after the time period specified in the error message. This is renewed on a monthly basis.
  * To have the resource start working again immediately, you can upgrade from using the Free (F0) tier to a paid tier SKU.

**Text Translator Quotas**
* If you are using the Text Translator and receive a 403 quota error, it could also indicate that you've exceeded your hourly or per minute quota for character translations

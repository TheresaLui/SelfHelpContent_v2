# Not sure why I ran out of quota

## **Recommended Steps**

**Common reasons for hitting 403 quota errors include:**

* If you are using the Free (F0) SKUs of Cognitive Services they have a monthly quota for the number of calls that can be made. If you have hit this monthly quota and are receiving 403 errors, then there are two options:
* The 403 error for a Free resource will reset after the time period specified in the error message.  They are renewed on a monthly basis.
* To have the resource start working again immediately, you can upgrade from using the Free (F0) tier to a paid tier SKU.

To learn more, see [Cognitive Service Pricing FAQ]( https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).

**Text Translator Quotas**
*If you are using the Text Translator and receive a 403 quota error it could also indicate that you have exceeded your hourly or per minute quota for character translations
*To learn more about Cognitive Services Text Translator quota limits please see [Request limits for Translator]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/request-limits#character-limits-per-hour).

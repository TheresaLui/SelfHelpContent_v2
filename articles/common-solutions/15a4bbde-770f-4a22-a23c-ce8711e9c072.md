# Issues with Log Analytics workspace

SQL insights (preview) stores its monitoring data in a Log Analytics workspace. You need sufficient access to this workspace to enable monitoring and view the collected data.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Verify that you have a Log Analytics workspace. If not, you can [create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace)
- Verify that the workspace is in a [supported region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-enable) for SQL insights
- Verify that region of your monitoring profile and the region of your workspace are the same
- Verify that you have the [Log Analytics contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) on the workspace. If not, you will be unable to create a monitoring profile or alert rules
- Verify that you have [Log Analytics reader role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) on the workspace. If not, you will be unable to view the data

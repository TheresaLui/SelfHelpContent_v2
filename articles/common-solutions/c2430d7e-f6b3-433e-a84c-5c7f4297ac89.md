# Install certificates

A proper SSL certificate ensures that you're sending encrypted information to the right server. Besides encryption, the certificate also allows for authentication. You can upload your own trusted SSL certificate via the PowerShell interface of the device

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Connect to the PowerShell interface. Use the Set-HcsCertificate cmdlet to upload the certificate
2. When prompted, provide the following parameters: CertificateFilePath - Path to the share that contains the certificate file in .pfx format
3. CertificatePassword is the password used to protect the certificate
4. Credentials: Username to access the share that contains the certificate. Provide the password to the network share when prompted.
5. You can also upload IoT Edge certificates to enable a secure connection between your IoT Edge device and the downstream devices that may connect to it. There are three IoT Edge certificates (.pem format) that you need to install: Root CA certificate or the owner CA, Device CA certificate, and Device key certificate.

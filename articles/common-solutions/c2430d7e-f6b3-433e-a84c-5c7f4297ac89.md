# Install certificates

A valid SSL certificate ensures that you're sending encrypted information to the correct server. Besides encryption, the certificate also allows for authentication. You can upload your own trusted SSL certificate through the PowerShell interface of the device.

You can also upload IoT Edge certificates to enable a secure connection between your IoT Edge device and the downstream devices that may connect to it. There are three IoT Edge certificates (`.pem`) that you need to install: Root CA certificate or the owner CA, Device CA certificate, and Device key certificate.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Connect to the PowerShell interface. Use the **Set-HcsCertificate** cmdlet to upload the certificate.
2. When prompted, provide the following parameters: 
   - `CertificateFilePath` - Path to the share that contains the certificate file in `.pfx` format
   - `CertificatePassword` - Password used to protect the certificate
   - `Credentials` -  Username to access the share that contains the certificate. Provide the password to the network share when prompted.

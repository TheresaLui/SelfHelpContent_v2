# Seamless SSO configuration, integration, and migration issues

Most users can resolve issues with migration, integrating Seamless SSO with their apps, configuring their apps, token claims, and lifetimes, and managing guest users, by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Follow the [Quickstart: Configure properties for an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-configure) guide to configure your application.
2. Depending on the application and [Single sign-on option](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/sso-options) that you chose, follow the appropriate guidance below:  
   - To configure an **on-premises application** for **SAML-based single sign-on**, see [SAML single-sign-on for on-premises applications with Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-on-premises-apps).
   - To configure a **cloud application** for **password-based single sign-on**, see [Configure password single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-password-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications).
   - To configure an **on-premises application** for **single sign-on through Application Proxy**, see [Password vaulting for single sign-on with Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-single-sign-on-password-vaulting).
3. **Troubleshooting Application Proxy issues**: we recommend that you start with reviewing the troubleshooting flow, [Debug Application Proxy Connector issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-debug-connectors), to determine if Application Proxy connectors are configured correctly. If you're still having trouble connecting to the application, follow the troubleshooting steps in [Debug Application Proxy application issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-debug-apps). You can [identify CORS issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-understand-cors-issues#understand-and-identify-cors-issues) by using the following browser debug tools:
   - Launch the browser and browse to the web app.
   - Press **F12** to bring up the debug console.
   - Try to reproduce the transaction, and review the console message. A CORS violation produces a console error about origin. 
   - Some CORS issues can't be resolved, such as when your app redirects to login.microsoftonline.com to authenticate, and the access token expires. The CORS call then fails. A workaround for this scenario is to extend the lifetime of the access token, to prevent it from expiring during a userâ€™s session. For more information about how to do this, see [Configurable token lifetimes in Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes).
4. **Troubleshooting SAML-based single sign-on**: we recommend checking [Problems signing in to SAML-based single sign-on configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-federated-sso-gallery), to find the solutions to the issues you are most likely to encounter.
5. **Troubleshooting password-based single sign-on**:  we recommend checking [Troubleshoot password-based single sign-on in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/troubleshoot-password-based-sso), to find the solutions to the issues you are most likely to encounter.

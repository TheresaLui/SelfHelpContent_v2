# PostgreSQL project upgrades

**Minor version upgrades**: The PostgreSQL project regularly issues minor releases to fix reported bugs. Azure Database for PostgreSQL automatically patches servers with minor releases during the service's monthly deployments. 

**Major version upgrades**: For upgrading your databases, you can perform a PostgreSQL dump and restore the operation, or use Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate your databases to a higher version.

## **Recommended Steps**

For major version upgrades, see [dump and restore documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/how-to-upgrade-using-dump-and-restore) for details. That guide provides several methods and step-by-step guides to perform upgrades.

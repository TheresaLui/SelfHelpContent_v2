# Issues with Windows Hello for Business in Key Trust Deployment

Most users are able to resolve their Windows Hello for Business (WHFB) deployment issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Issue provisioning WHFB in key trust deployment**
1. Make sure that all prerequisites for Hybrid Key trust have been met. See [Hybrid Key trust Windows Hello for Business Prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-key-trust-prereqs).
2. Run `DSREGCMD /STATUS` from PowerShell and review the output for the **NGC Prerequisite Check**. Confirm that the `CertificateEnrollment` field shows `CertEnrollment : none`. If this check is reporting anything other than none, review the policy configuration for the **"User certificate for on-premises authentication"** policy and confirm that it is set to **disabled**.

**Issue signing in with WHFB in key trust deployment**
1. Make sure that the Windows Hello credential has synced from AAD to AD. This occurs with the AAD Connect sync cycle and can take from 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete after provisioning. 
2. Make sure that you have an adequate number of **2016 DCs or newer** to handle Windows Hello for Business key trust authentication requests. See [Planning an adequate number of Windows Server 2016 or later Domain Controllers for Windows Hello for Business deployments](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-adequate-domain-controllers).
3. Make sure the domain controller certificate is in the **NTAuth store**. If you are using a non-Microsoft Enterprise CA, this may not be done by default and authentication will fail.  
4. Did you validate your **DC cert** using `Certutil -verify -urlfetch <.cer file path>`?

# I can't find a SQL managed instance metric

SQL insights allows you to customize the data you collect from your SQL environment. Below, we will verify which data sets are being collected and describe a way to view them.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. When you create a SQL insights monitoring profile you specify both the data you want to collect as well as the systems to collect it from
2. Select the profile in the SQL insights UX and the **Overview** tab will display high level monitoring details
3. Next select the **Manage profile** tab and you will see the name of the workspace that data is stored in and a list of monitoring VMs associated to the profile
4. Select **Edit Profile** to see which data sets you are collecting
5. You can now refer to [our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-overview#azure-sql-managed-instance-data), which covers details about each data set
6. In the SQL insights UX, once you have chosen the resource of interest, you can also use the **Explore metrics** tab to view all of the metrics collected for that resource

# Issues signing into Gallery or Bring your own apps
## **Recommended Steps**

Resolve the most common issues when signing in to Gallery or Bring your own apps by using the following information.

**I have trouble signing in to SAML based single sign-on (SSO) configured apps** 

• [Debug SAML-based SSO issues through SSO Testing experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/debug-saml-sso-issues)
• [Error AADSTS50011 - The reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch)
• [Error AADSTS650056 - Misconfigured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app)
• [Error AADSTS70001 - Application with Identifier was not found in the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory)
• [Error AADSTS50105 - The signed in user is not assigned to a role for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50105-user-not-assigned-role)
• [Error AADSTS750054 - SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts750054-saml-request-not-present)
• [Error - AADSTS75011 Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts75011-auth-method-mismatch)
• Resolve more [AADSTS errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) & [Troubleshoot signing in to SAML based SSO configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-federated-sso-gallery?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Apps_Sign_In_Support_L2_Gallery)
• [I can signin to my application, but I’m seeing an error on the application sign-in page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-application-error?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Apps_Sign_In_Support_L2_Gallery)

**I’m having problems configuring Single sign-on to my application –**

• [I can’t add Identifier or Reply URL or can't set Identifier format/add another instance of application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/troubleshoot-saml-based-sso?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Enterprise_Apps_Support_L2_Overview)
• [Learn about SAML configuration settings (Reply URL, Logout URL, Sign-on URL, Identifier)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-saml-single-sign-on#saml-signing-certificate)
• [Tutorial on integrating SaaS applications with Azure AD and configuring Single Sign-on (SSO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list)
• I need assistance configuring [SAML based Single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso) or [OIDC-based Single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso)
• [Learn how to Configure SAML-based single sign-on using Microsoft Graph APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/application-saml-sso-configure-api?tabs=http#step-4-configure-signing-certificate)

**I’m having trouble accessing my application and getting Admin consent-related errors**

• I want to [Configure Admin consent workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) and [Grant tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#:~:text=The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API.&text=before%20granting%20consent.-,The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is%20required%20in%20order%20to%20provide,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API)
• [Evaluate a request for tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests#evaluating-a-request-for-tenant-wide-admin-consent) & [Manage user and admin permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-application-permissions)
• [Configure how end-users consent to applications using Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?tabs=azure-portal#user-consent-settings)
• [I see an unexpected error when performing consent to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-unexpected-user-consent-error)
• Remove ‘prompt =consent’ setting from the application (if present), so it doesn't cause required consent to go on a loop between admin consent and user request for the app

**I have questions about SAML certificates, Keys and Secrets**

• How to [create a client secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) and [certificate signing options & algorithms](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/certificate-signing-options)
• [Monitor my certificate/client secret expiry OR I’m not receiving email notifications for certificate expiration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/app-management-powershell-samples)
• [I want to customize expiration date for my certificate/create or renew my SAML certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on#customize-the-expiration-date-for-your-federation-certificate-and-roll-it-over-to-a-new-certificate)
• [I want to understand how Signing Key rollover affects my application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-signing-key-rollover)

**I have questions on SAML token claims and attributes**

• [Set token lifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/configure-token-lifetimes#create-a-policy-for-web-sign-in) & [Configure User sign-in frequency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime#user-sign-in-frequency) for [Refresh tokens and session tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes#token-lifetime-policies-for-refresh-tokens-and-session-tokens)
• [Group claims are not sent for user during SSO login if a user is a member of more than 150 groups (SAML) or 200 groups (JWT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#options-for-applications-to-consume-group-information). It is recommended to [emit only groups assigned to the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#add-group-claims-to-tokens-for-saml-applications-using-sso-configuration)

**I can’t sign in to my application and am getting errors related to user/groups assignment**

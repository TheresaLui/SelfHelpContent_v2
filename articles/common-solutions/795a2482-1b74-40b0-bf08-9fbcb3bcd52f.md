# Configure Shares

To transfer data to Azure, you need to create shares on your Azure Stack Edge. The shares that you add on the Azure Stack Edge device can be local shares or shares that push data to cloud.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Local shares: Use these shares when you want the data to be processed locally on the device
2. Shares: Use these shares when you want the device data to be automatically pushed to your storage account in the cloud. All the cloud functions such as Refresh and Sync storage keys apply to the shares.
3. On the Azure Portal, you can add a share, delete a share, refresh shares, or sync storage keys

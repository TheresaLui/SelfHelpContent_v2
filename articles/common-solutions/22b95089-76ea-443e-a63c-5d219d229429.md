# Issues linking Synapse workspace to Azure ML workspace

To link a Synapse workspace, you must acquire the **owner** role in AAD for the Synapse workspace resource. At the very least, the role needs to have "write" permissions on the **roleAssignments** actions.

If these requirements aren't met, you may encounter the error message: 
<br>"You do not have permission to link this workspace (missing Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write over this resource)."

## **Recommended Steps**

Do one of the following:
- Contact your Resource Group Owner to be made an Owner of the Synapse workspace resource in AAD **Access control (IAM)** portal 
- Choose a different Synapse workspace

# Device Update deployment status self-help

It looks like you're having issues with viewing the status of a deployment. Most users are able to resolve their deployment status issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that your deployment's start date is not set in the future. When you create a new deployment, the deployment start date is defaulted to the next day as a safeguard unless you explicitly change it. You can either wait for the deployment start date to arrive, or cancel the ongoing deployment and create a new deployment with the desired start date.
2. Check the [Device Update troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/iot-hub-device-update/troubleshoot-device-update) to see if your issue is addressed. If you are still encountering issues, please create a new support request.

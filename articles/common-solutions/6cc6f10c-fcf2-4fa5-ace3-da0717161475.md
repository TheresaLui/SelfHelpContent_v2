# How can I configure my workspace’s data retention?

## **Recommended Steps**
To set the retention for your workspace:
1. From your workspace, select **Usage and estimated costs** from the left pane. 
1. On the **Usage and estimated costs** page, select **Data Retention** from the top of the page. 
1. On the pane, move the slider to increase or decrease the number of days, and then select **OK**. 

Alternatively, you can [set data retention by data type](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#retention-by-data-type) using Azure Resource Manager. If you are on the legacy Free tier, you won't be able to modify the data retention period. Instead, you need to change pricing tiers in order to control this setting. Data types for which retention has not explicity specificed will get the retention set at the workspace-level. 

**Note:** Additional retention has associated charges. See details on the [Azure Monitor pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/). Also, note that the Log Analytics purge API will not reduce costs from data retention. To reduce costs, you must reduce the retention on your workspace or on specific data types in your workspace.  

The Log Analytics [purge API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspacepurge/purge) does not affect retention billing and is intended to be used for very limited cases.

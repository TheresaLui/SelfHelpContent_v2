# Issue with increasing metric retention
Most users are able to resolve their inability to increase metric retention using the steps below. 

## **Recommended Steps**
Most metrics in Azure are stored for 93 days. Currently there is no way to increase metric retention. However, for [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) log-based metrics you can query up to two years of data. Behind the scene, Application Insights log-based metrics translate into log queries. Their retention matches the retention of events in underlying logs.

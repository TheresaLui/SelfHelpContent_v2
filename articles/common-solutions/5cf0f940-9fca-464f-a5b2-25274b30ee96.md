# SAP Cloud Platform Connectivity
Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below:

## **Recommended Steps**

### SAP Cloud Platform **Connectivity service** requests to on-premise systems may

- Fail with HTTP 503 "Service Unavailable" due to SCC not connected or wrong SCC Location ID is used: lution: check SCC connection and verify the SCC location ID
- Fail with HTTP 502 "Bad Gateway", SCC cannot connect to backend due to on-premise network issue or backend is down: check the on-premise networking configuration 
- Fail with HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" due to Principal Propagation (Single-Sign-On) not properly configured on SCC side or backend does not authorize the user principal: check Principal Propagation (Single-Sign-On) configuration on SCC side and the user principal configuration
- Fail with HTTP 403 "Forbidden" due to backend or resource not configured correctly in SCC: verify SCC configuration with the resource 
- Fail with HTTP 407 "Proxy Authentication Required" due to invalid OAuth access token (JWT) provided to the HTTP proxy exposed by SAP CP Connectivity service: double check the OAuth access token 
- Time out:

   - SCC not connected or wrong SCC Location ID is used: double check the SCC connection and SCC Location ID
   - Significant latency between customer premise and the chosen SAP CP region: verify and improve the latency
   - Backend is overloaded thus responding slowly: try again later time

### SAP Cloud Platform **Destination service** requests to Destination service REST API

- Fail with HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" due to invalid OAuth access token (JWT) provided to the service: verify the OAuth access token
- Fail with HTTP 403 "Forbidden" due to insufficient permissions of the OAuth access token (JWT) provided to the service: check OAuth access token permission
- Fail with HTTP 404 "Not Found" due to the resource tried to be found does not exist: check does the resource still exist
- Fail with HTTP 409 "Conflict" due to the resource tried to be created already exists: delete the old resource and create again or use exist resource
- Destination UI fails to load in SCP cloud cockpit: check user permissions as user may not be authorized to manage destination configurations

### Check Connection

- If results to HTTP error codes between 200 and 399: the status OK, i.e. HTTP connection can be established to the target URL
- If results to HTTP error codes between 400 and 499: double check the complete URL in the destination configuration or contact target system owner to check the server’s operational state
- If results to HTTP error codes equal or bigger than 500: the HTTP connection cannot be established, contact target system owner to check the server’s operational state

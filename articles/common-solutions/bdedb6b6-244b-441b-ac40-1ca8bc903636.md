# Authoring or Development Issues - Authentication Failure

Use the following guidelines to assign permissions and roles in Azure Data Factory (ADF).

## **Recommended Steps**

* To create and manage child resources for Azure Data Factory (including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes in the Azure portal), you must have the [**Data Factory Contributor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor) role at the **Resource Group** level or above. For more information, see [Roles and requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions#roles-and-requirements).<br>

* To create and manage child resources with PowerShell or SDK, you'll need the **Data Factory Contributor** role at the Resource Group level or above<br>

* To have greater access control for ADF portal users, consider creating a separate resource group for your data factory<br>

* To grant different access levels to different data factory users, create a **Custom** role. See [Custom scenarios and custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-roles-permissions#custom-scenarios-and-custom-roles).<br>

* If you moved Data Factory from one tenant to another and are having issues, try generating a new managed identity. To do this, you can use PowerShell or the REST API. For more information, see [Generate service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity#generate-service-identity).

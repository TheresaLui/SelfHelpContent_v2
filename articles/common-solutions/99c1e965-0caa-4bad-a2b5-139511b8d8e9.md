# Kubernetes applications Kubectl

On your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, a Kubernetes cluster is created when you configure the compute role. After the Kubernetes cluster is created, then you can connect to and manage the cluster locally from a client machine through a native command-line tool such as `kubectl`.

## **Recommended Steps**
1.	Connect to the PowerShell interface of the device on the Windows client running PowerShell. You can connect by using Windows or Linux.
2.	After the Kubernetes cluster is created, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to access the cluster.
3.	Configure cluster access through role-based access control (RBAC). for more information, see the links in the following section.

### Notes
* There are many commands that you won't be able to run - for example, the commands that require you to have admin access. You can only perform operations that are allowed on the namespace.
* Download a client that is skewed no more than one minor version from the master. The client version may lead the master by up to one minor version.

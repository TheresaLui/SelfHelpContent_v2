# Kubernetes applications Kubectl

On your Azure Stack Edge device, a Kubernetes cluster is created when you configure the compute role. After the Kubernetes cluster is created, then you can connect to and manage the cluster locally from a client machine through a native command-line tool such as `kubectl`.

## **Recommended Steps**
1.	On the Windows client running PowerShell, connect to the PowerShell interface of the device. You can connect by using Windows or Linux.
2.	After the Kubernetes cluster is created, use the `kubectl` command-line tool to access the cluster.
3.	Configure cluster access through role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see the links in the following section.

### Notes
* There are many commands you won't be able to run (such as,  commands that require you to have admin access). You can only perform operations that are allowed on the namespace.
* Download a client that is skewed no more than one minor version from the master. The client version may lead the master by up to one minor version.

# Configure Health Probes

To determine the health of each backend, each Azure Front Door environment periodically sends a synthetic HTTP/HTTPS request to your configured backends. Front Door then uses responses from these probes to determine the best backends to which it should route real client requests.

Front Door supports sending probes over HTTP or HTTPS protocols. These probes are sent over the same TCP ports configured for routing client requests, and cannot be overridden.

# Bandwidth Schedules

You can add, modify, or delete the bandwidth schedules for your Azure Stack Edge via the Azure portal.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Provide the Start day, End day, Start time, and End time of the schedule
2. Bandwidth rate is the bandwidth in Megabits per second (Mbps) used by your device in operations involving the cloud (both uploads and downloads). Supply a number between 20 and 1,000,000,007 for this field.
3. Check the All day option if this schedule should run all day

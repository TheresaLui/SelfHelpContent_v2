# Issues related to Database, Webapp and VDI tools in Azure Migrate

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Issues with Movere and Webapp tools**

Submit these issues using the following links:
- [Movere](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118708)
- [WebApp (ASMA)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118709)

### **Issues related to database assessment and migration**

Submit queries related to database assessment and migration under the **Database Migration Service***.

Go back to the previous tab, **Basics**, and select **Database Migration Service** as the service. In this particular service, you can find details related to database assessment and migration issues.

### **Issues with VDI Assessment (lakeside)** 

See [Troubleshoot/open support tickets with lakeside](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118054).

### **Added tools don't show up in the Servers, Databases, or VDI pages** 

Ensure that you have selected the right project by selecting **Change** against **Migrate project (Change)** on the upper-right corner of your screen in **Servers** or **Databases**. Now choose the correct subscription and project name, and select **OK**. The page should refresh with the added tools of the selected Azure Migrate project. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/create-manage-projects#find-a-project). 

### Does Azure Migrate provide private link support for migrating Databases, Web apps, and VDI to Azure?
Azure Migrate private link support is limited to the Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment tool and Azure Migrate: Server Migration tool.

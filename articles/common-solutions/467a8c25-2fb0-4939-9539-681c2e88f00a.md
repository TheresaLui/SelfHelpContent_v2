# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Assigning permissions and using RBAC

Resolve issues with assigning permissions by reviewing the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. For best results, roles should be assigned on the resource group that contains the Azure Sentinel workspace. 
   This way, the roles will apply to all the resources that are deployed to support Azure Sentinel. Those resources should also be placed in the same resource group.
 
2. Another option is to assign the roles directly on the Azure Sentinel workspace itself. 
If you do this, you must assign the same roles on the `SecurityInsights` solution resource in that workspace. 
   You may need to assign the roles on other resources as well, and will need to constantly manage role assignments on resources.

3. Custom roles and advanced Azure RBAC 
	1. You can also use create Azure custom roles for Azure Sentinel. 
      Azure custom roles for Azure Sentinel are created the same way you create other [Azure custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-rest#create-a-custom-role), based on [specific permissions to Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftsecurityinsights) and to [Azure Log Analytics resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftoperationalinsights).
   
    2. You can use the Log Analytics advanced Azure role-based access control across the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace. This includes both data type-based Azure RBAC and resource-centric Azure RBAC. For more information on Log Analytics roles, see [Manage log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-access#manage-access-using-workspace-permissions).

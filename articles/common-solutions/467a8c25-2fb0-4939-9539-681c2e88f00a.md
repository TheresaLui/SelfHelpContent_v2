# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Assigning permissions and using RBAC

Resolve issues with assigning permissions by reviewing the following steps and documents.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. For best results, assign roles on the resource group that contains the Azure Sentinel workspace. 
   This way, the roles will apply to all the resources that are deployed to support Azure Sentinel. Those resources should also be placed in the same resource group.
 
2. Another option is to assign the roles directly on the Azure Sentinel workspace itself. 
   If you do this, you must assign the same roles on the `SecurityInsights` solution resource in that workspace. 
   You may need to assign the roles on other resources as well, and will need to constantly manage role assignments on resources.

3. Custom roles: You can create Azure custom roles for Azure Sentinel the same way you create other [Azure custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-rest#create-a-custom-role), based on [specific permissions to Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftsecurityinsights) and to [Azure Log Analytics resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftoperationalinsights).
   
4. Advanced Azure RBAC: You can use the Log Analytics advanced Azure role-based access control across the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace. This includes both data type-based Azure RBAC and resource-centric Azure RBAC. For more information on Log Analytics roles, see [Manage log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-access#manage-access-using-workspace-permissions).

## **Recommended Documents**
* [Azure Sentinel Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-reader) can view data, incidents, workbooks, and other Azure Sentinel resources.

* [Azure Sentinel Responder](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-responder) can, in addition to the above, manage incidents (assign, dismiss, etc.)

* [Azure Sentinel Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-contributor) can, in addition to the above, create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Azure Sentinel resources.

* [Permissions in Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/roles)

* [Roles and allowed actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/roles?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#roles-and-allowed-actions)

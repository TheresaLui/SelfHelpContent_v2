# I can't setup the alerts for my health thresholds

## **Recommended Steps**
 

Alert rules for Azure Monitor for VMs guest health are currently in preview and cannot be created. Alerts will be created for each virtual machine by default, but not for each monitor.
 
To enable alerts for a particular virtual machine (or for a particular monitor on a virtual machine), use **Alert status** in the configuration settings for the virtual machine in the Azure portal. For details, see [Configure monitoring in Azure Monitor for VMs guest health (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-configure). Review [Configure monitoring in Azure Monitor for VMs guest health using data collection rules (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-configure-dcr) for details on configuring monitors across a set of virtual machines.

 
To be proactively notified of an alert triggered by VM guest health, you'll need to [configure notifications using an action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-alerts#configure-notifications).

# I can't setup the alerts for my health thresholds

## **Recommended Steps**

You cannot create an explicit alert rule for Azure Monitor for VMs guest health while this feature is in preview. By default, alerts will be created for each virtual machine but not for each monitor. 
 
You can enable alerts for a particular virtual machine or for a particular monitor on a virtual machine from the Alert status setting in the configuration for the virtual machine in the Azure portal. See [Configure monitoring in Azure Monitor for VMs guest health (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-configure)for details on configuring monitors in the Azure portal. See [Configure monitoring in Azure Monitor for VMs guest health using data collection rules (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-configure-dcr) for details on configuring monitors across a set of virtual machines.
 

 
To be proactively notified of an alert triggered by VM guest health, you need to [configure notifications using action rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-health-alerts#configure-notifications).

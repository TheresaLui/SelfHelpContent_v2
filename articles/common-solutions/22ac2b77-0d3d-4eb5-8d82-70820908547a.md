# Azure Maps Weather services

When working with Weather services, you may need to:
- Know the coverage of Azure Maps Weather services
- Learn how Weather data is displayed: unit types, weather icons, radar and satellite imagery color scale.
- Understand the difference between different kinds of Index IDs and Index Groups IDs for daily weather indices and how to determine which ones to use 
- Create REST API queries to request real-time and forecasted weather data

Most users find that they can resolve these issues by using the following information.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Weather services FAQ]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-faq)

* [Weather service coverage by country/region]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-coverage)

* Some of the Weather service APIs allow user to specify if the data is returned either in metric or in imperial units. The returned responses for these APIs include unitType and a numeric value that can be used for unit translations.[See this article for more details]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#unit-types)

* Some of the Weather service APIs return the iconCode in the response. The iconCode is a numeric value used to define the icon. [Access images for each iconCde.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#weather-icons)

*  [Guide to help interpret colors used for radar and satellite tiles.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#radar-and-satellite-imagery-color-scale)

*[Tutorial to join IoT sensor data with weather forecast data by using Azure Notebooks (Python)]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-service-tutorial)

### **Additional Guidance**

* Raster and Infrared satellite tiles are available through [Azure Maps Render v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/renderv2) REST API. Other Weather APIs are part of [Azure Maps Weather service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather).

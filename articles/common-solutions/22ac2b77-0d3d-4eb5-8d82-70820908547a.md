# Azure Maps Weather services

When working with Weather services, you may need to:
- Know the coverage of Azure Maps Weather services
- Learn how Weather data is displayed: unit types, weather icons, radar and satellite imagery color scale
- Understand the difference between Index IDs and Index Groups IDs for daily weather indices, and how to determine which ones to use 
- Create REST API queries to request real-time and forecasted weather data

Most users find that they can resolve these issues by using the following information.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Weather services FAQ]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-faq)

* [Weather service coverage by country/region]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-coverage)

* Some Weather service APIs allow users to specify whether data is returned in metric or imperial units. The returned responses for these APIs include **unitType** and a numeric value that can be used for unit translations.[See this article for more details]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#unit-types).

* Some Weather service APIs return the **iconCode** in the response. The iconCode is a numeric value that defines the icon. [See images for each iconCode.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#weather-icons).

*  [Review this guide to interpret colors used for radar and satellite tiles.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-services-concepts#radar-and-satellite-imagery-color-scale)

*  [Review this tutorial to join IoT sensor data with weather forecast data using Azure Notebooks (Python)]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/weather-service-tutorial)

### **Additional Guidance**

* Raster and Infrared satellite tiles are available through [Azure Maps Render v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/renderv2) REST API. Other Weather APIs are part of [Azure Maps Weather service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather).

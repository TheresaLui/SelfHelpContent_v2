# Authentication with WVD and Smart Card.

The following content may help if you are seeing issues with authentication in Windows Virtual Desktop and using a smart card.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure smart card mini-drivers are installed on WVD clients and session hosts. Most mini-drivers will be automatically installed with Windows Update but, you may have to request these from the smartcard manufacturer. [Inbox Smart card Minidrivers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/smartcard/windows-inbox-smart-card-minidriver)
2. Use the certutil.exe -scinfo tool to verify that clients and WVD session hosts can read information from the smart card [Certutil information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-debugging-information#certutil)
3. Use the certutil.exe -DCinfo to verify all your domain controllers have a valid certificate [Certutil DCinfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-dcinfo)
4. Verify that all certificates are trusted by all parties and that revocation information are reachable with certutil.exe -verify [Certutil verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-verify)

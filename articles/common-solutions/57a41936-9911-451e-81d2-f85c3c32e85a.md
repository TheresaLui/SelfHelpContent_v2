# Authentication with WVD and Smart Card.

Most customers can resolve issues with authentication in Windows Virtual Desktop and using a smart card using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure that smart card mini-drivers are installed on WVD clients and session hosts. Most mini-drivers will be automatically installed with Windows Update. However, you may have to request these from the smartcard manufacturer. For details, review [Inbox Smart card Minidrivers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/smartcard/windows-inbox-smart-card-minidriver).

2. Use the `certutil.exe -scinfo` tool to verify that clients and WVD session hosts can read information from the smart card. For details, review [Certutil information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-debugging-information#certutil)

3. Use the `certutil.exe -DCinfo` to verify that all of your domain controllers have a valid certificate. For details, review [Certutil DCinfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-dcinfo).

4. Verify that all certificates are trusted by all parties and that revocation information is reachable by using `certutil.exe -verify`. For details, review [Certutil verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-verify).

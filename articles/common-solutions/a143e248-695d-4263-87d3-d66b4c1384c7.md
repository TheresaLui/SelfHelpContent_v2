# SAP Cloud Platform API Management

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Accessing API Portal**

* HTTP Status 403 Forbidden: User need be assigned with **APIPortal.Administrator** role from the SAP cloud platform cockpit

### **Execute API proxy**

* When API proxy executed, log on error appears even though we have API Key and provided credentials in API Provider: The credentials provided in API Provider helps during discovery of APIs while creating an API Proxy. When we hit the API proxy, provider does not come into picture. Use the [Basic Authentication policy](https://help.sap.com/viewer/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/Cloud/en-US/693c0d1720644d57918ed77acc6a95ef.html?q=Basic%20Authentication%20policy) for this use case to pass the Backend user credentials in the API Proxy flow.

### **Developer Portal Home Page**

* User is not seeing the option to edit Developer Portal home page description, logo or add new navigation categories: Log onto the Developer Portal, navigate to the Manage tab -> Registered Users, select the users who would like to edit the Developer Portal and assign **Site Administrator** and **Content Administrator** role

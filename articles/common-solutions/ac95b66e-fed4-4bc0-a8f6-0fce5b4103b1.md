# I've shutdown the device and unable to restart it

You can shut down or restart your virtual device using the local web UI. We recommend that before you restart, take the shares offline on the host and then the device. This action minimizes any possibility of data corruption.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the local web UI, go to Maintenance > Power settings
2. Click Shutdown or Restart depending on what you intend to do
3. If you shut down the virtual device, you will need to start the device through the hypervisor management.

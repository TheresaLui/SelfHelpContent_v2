# Issues related to Access Panel (MyApps portal)


## **Recommended Steps**

The following information can help you resolve some of the most common issues related to Access Panel (MyApps portal).

**Can’t find applications in My Apps Portal OR I don’t know why an app is appearing in Access Panel**

* [Apps might be hidden](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/my-apps-portal-user-collections) in New Apps experience. Navigate to the URL -  [My Apps collections](https://myapplications.microsoft.com/?endUserCollections) and click on "Manage" option on the top right of the site. Unhide all hidden collections
* If you are a Guest user, you can see only Azure Integrated apps & not Office Apps. Only if you integrate Office Apps with Azure, then you can see them in My Apps Panel.
* Use [Supported browsers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access), [ensure users are assigned to the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users) & property [Visible to Users is enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-configure) or [use App roles for your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#app-roles-ui--preview).

# Computer Vision (Read 2.0) Container

Containers enable you to run the Computer Vision APIs in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements. 
In this article you'll learn how to download, install, and run a Computer Vision container.

A single Docker container, Read, is available for Computer Vision. The Read container allows you to detect and extract printed text from images of various objects with different surfaces and backgrounds, such as receipts, posters, and business cards. Additionally, the Read container detects handwritten text in images and provides PDF, TIFF, and multi-page file support. For more information, see the Read API documentation.

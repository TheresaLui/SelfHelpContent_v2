# Issues signing into applications developed by my company

Resolve common issues with signing in to applications, including issues with SLM-based single sign-on (SSO); Admin consent-related errors; and SAML token claims, attributes, certificates, Keys, and Secrets by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

**I can’t sign in to SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured apps (issues with Reply URL, Identifier value, misconfigured applications, AuthN issues, HTTP Redirect binding)**

* [Debug SAML based SSO issues through SSO Testing experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/debug-saml-sso-issues)
* [Error AADSTS50011 - The reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch)
* [Error AADSTS650056 - Misconfigured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app)
* [Error AADSTS70001 - Application with Identifier was not found in the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory)
* [Error AADSTS50105 - The signed in user is not assigned to a role for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50105-user-not-assigned-role)
* [I have questions on Reply URL’s restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url)
* [Error AADSTS750054 - SAMLRequest or SAMLResponse must be present as query string parameters in HTTP request for SAML Redirect binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts750054-saml-request-not-present)
* [AADSTS500031: Cannot find signing certificate configured](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/questions/141320/aadsts500031-cannot-find-signing-certificate-confi.html)
* Resolve more [AADSTS errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) & [Troubleshoot signing in to SAML based SSO configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-federated-sso-gallery?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Apps_Sign_In_Support_L2_Gallery)

**I get Admin consent-related errors while accessing my application**
* [Learn to configure Admin consent workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) and [Grant tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#:~:text=The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API.&text=before%20granting%20consent.-,The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is%20required%20in%20order%20to%20provide,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API)
* [While accessing the application, I get an error – Admin consent is required](https://blogs.aaddevsup.xyz/2020/04/troubleshooting-consent-in-azure-ad/)
* [Learn to create self-service sign-up for External Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview)
* [Learn to unlock my account through self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr#test-self-service-password-reset)

**I can’t associate Partner Center MPN ID with my application OR how to get my app publisher verified**

* Ensure the [app's publisher domain is verified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain#to-verify-a-new-domain-for-your-app) and MPN Id must be for [Partner global account](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/account-structure)
* Learn [pre-requisites for Publisher verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview#requirements) and [Publisher verification - overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview)
* How to [publish my app to the Azure AD App gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-howto-app-gallery-listing) and [mark my app publisher verified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/mark-app-as-publisher-verified)
* How to [troubleshoot unexpected behavior with Publisher verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/troubleshoot-publisher-verification#common-issues) process for my app

**I have questions on SAML token claims and attributes**	

* [Group claims are not sent for user during SSO login if a user is a member of more than 150 groups (SAML) or 200 groups (JWT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#options-for-applications-to-consume-group-information). It is recommended to [emit only groups assigned to the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#add-group-claims-to-tokens-for-saml-applications-using-sso-configuration)
* [Configure Azure AD SAML token encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/howto-saml-token-encryption#:~:text=%20To%20configure%20token%20encryption%20using%20PowerShell%20,settings%20using%20the%20following%20commands.PowerShell$app=Get-AzureADApplication%20-ObjectId...%20More)
* [Learn about restricted SAML claims set and how to a create Claims mapping policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-claims-mapping) 
* [Set token lifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/configure-token-lifetimes#create-a-policy-for-web-sign-in) & [Configure User sign-in frequency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime#user-sign-in-frequency) for [Refresh tokens and session tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes#token-lifetime-policies-for-refresh-tokens-and-session-tokens)

**I have questions about SAML certificates, Keys, and Secrets**

* [Learn how to create a client secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) or [renew my SAML X.509 Certificate for my application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-saml-single-sign-on#saml-signing-certificate)
* [Learn about Signing Key rollover process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-signing-key-rollover)

# Set up billing

To set up and manage billing for your organization in Azure DevOps, see the information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Azure DevOps billing related information**

* Why can't I see my Azure subscription to be linked with my Azure DevOps organization?<br>
  A user interface limitation prevents the subscription picker from displaying more than 50 subscriptions. If your user account has access to more than 50 subscriptions and the target subscription is not visible, do the following:
    1. Create a new user account
    2. Grant the account Owner/Contributor rights to the target subscription and administrative privileges to the Azure DevOps organization
    3. Use the new account to link the organization to the target subscription. If that is not an option, continue to create a support ticket.

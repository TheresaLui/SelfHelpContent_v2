# Azure Stack HCI registration guidance

Registering Azure Stack HCI creates an app identity, conceptually similar to a user, in your Azure Active Directory tenant. The app identity inherits the cluster name. This identity acts on behalf on the Azure Stack HCI cloud service, as appropriate, within your subscription.

If the user who Registers Azure Stack HCI is not an Azure Active Directory administrator or has not been delegated sufficient permissions, additional action is required from their Azure Active Directory administrator to complete registration. The administrator can either explicitly grant consent to the app, or they can delegate permissions to the user that is performing the registration.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Review the [Manage Azure registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/manage/manage-azure-registration) article and follow your organization's process to grant permissions to the app.

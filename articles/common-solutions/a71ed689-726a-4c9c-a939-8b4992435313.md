# Workflow automation

Most users are able to resolve their issues with workflow automation by using the steps below.

**Automation does not work or was not triggered.**  

Possible solutions:  
- Check that the alert or recommendation regarding the automation was not triggered or was created at least 30 minutes after you configured the automation the first time 
- Check that the alert or recommendation regarding the automation was not triggered in the Portal. If it is not shown in the Portal, there cannot be any automation based on it.  
- Check that you still have the relevant permissions to trigger the automation. You can view the relevant permissions in Availability section of the [feature documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/workflow-automation#availability).
- Check in the automation configuration that the trigger rule set was defined according to the information you expect to receive (for example, if you expected the automation to trigger on all alerts, but the automation trigger is defined only on High severity alerts, this will not produce the expected result).

**What is the recommended BCDR solution for Logic Apps?**

See the [Logic Apps BCDR guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-guidance).

**I can’t delete or change an automation configuration.**  

Check that you have the relevant permissions to delete or disable a configuration. See the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/workflow-automation#availability).

**I’d like to create a workflow automation on the Management Group level.**

## Logic App trigger

**How do I trigger the Logic App for a specific Security Center alert or recommendation?**  

See the [feature documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/workflow-automation#manually-trigger-a-logic-app).

**Why is the information sent in the trigger different from the information available in the API?**

There might be additional information available about a recommendation or alert that is not sent using this trigger because does not appear in the Portal.

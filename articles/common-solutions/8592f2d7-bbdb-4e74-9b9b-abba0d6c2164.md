# Managing VMs

You can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on an Azure Stack Edge device by using APIs. These APIs are standard Azure Resource Manager APIs called by using the local Azure Stack Edge endpoint. The Azure Resource Manager APIs provide a consistent management layer that, in this case, enables you to create, update, and delete VMs in a local subscription that exists on the device. You can connect to the Azure Resource Manager running on Azure Stack Edge through Azure PowerShell cmdlets.

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Run the following cmdlet to stop or shut down a virtual machine running on your device: 

```
PowerShellCopy Stop-AzureRmVM [-Name] <String> [-StayProvisioned] [-ResourceGroupName] <String>
```
2.	For all other commands for managing ASE VMs, see the link in the following section

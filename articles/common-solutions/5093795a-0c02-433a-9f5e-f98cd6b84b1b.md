# I can't setup my monitoring VM

Once you have created your SQL insights Monitoring profile you need to associate one or more monitoring VMs to the profile.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that you have [met the requirements for a SQL insights monitoring VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-enable).  In particular, pay attention to the supported operating systems.
2. Verify that you have the [Virtual Machine Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) on the VM that you will be setting up.
3. Once the VM has been setup for use by SQL insights, verify that the following extensions are installed on the VM and provisioning succeeded:
 AzureMonitorLinuxAgent
 Workload.WLILinuxExtension

4. If the above looks good, then the VM has been enabled for monitoring of SQL.

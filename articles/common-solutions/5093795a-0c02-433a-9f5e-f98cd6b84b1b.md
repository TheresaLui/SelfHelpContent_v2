# Configure a virtual machine for monitoring 

To monitor your resources with SQL insights (preview), you need to create a monitoring profile and a virtual machine.

## Recommended Steps

- Verify that the monitoring virtual machine you created meets the [region, operating system, and size requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-enable#create-azure-virtual-machine)
- Verify that you have the [Virtual Machine Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) on the virtual machine that you intend to use for monitoring
- Verify that the virtual machine has not been added to any other SQL insights (preview) monitoring profiles
- Verify that the provisioning succeeded when your virtual machine was [added to your monitoring profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/sql-insights-enable#add-monitoring-machine)
- After adding the virtual machine to a monitoring profile, verify that the following [extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview) are installed on the virtual machine: AzureMonitorLinuxAgent, Workload.WLILinuxExtension

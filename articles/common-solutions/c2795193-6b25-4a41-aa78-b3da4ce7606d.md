# Issues with Initiate Move of the resources

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Before initiating move of VMs, please ensure you have committed the Source RG and it's in Delete source pending state
2. Please note: The source VM is shut down, and some downtime occurs (usually minutes)
3. Before initiating move of Elastic Pools and SQL Dbs, please ensure you have source SQL Server moved first, and in a Delete source pending state


Target region has quota issues
1. Check that the target subscription has enough quota to create resources in the target region. If it doesn't have enough quota, you need to request additional limits.

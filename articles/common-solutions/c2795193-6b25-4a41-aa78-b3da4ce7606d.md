# Issues with Initiate Move of the resources

Most users can resolve issues with initiating the move of resources by following the information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Before initiating the move of VMs, ensure that you have committed the source resource group and that it's in a Delete source pending state

- **Note:** The source VM is shut down, and some downtime occurs (usually minutes)

2. Before initiating the move of elastic pools and the SQL database, ensure that you have the source SQL Server moved first, and that it's in a Delete source pending state

3. If the target region has quota issues, check that the target subscription has enough quota to create resources in the target region. If it doesn't have enough quota, request higher limits.

# Create SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc resource

Most users are able to resolve their issues with creating or deploying a SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc using the recommended documents below.

## **Recommended Steps**

Did you know that some of these commands can be very useful when troubleshooting Managed Instance deployment issues?

1. You can use the **--debug** switch to get verbose information about the progress of your deployment. For example: 

   ```bash
   azdata arc sql mi create -n <sqlmi_instance_name> --cores-limit 4 --memory-limit 8Gi --debug
   ```

1. After completion of a MIAA-instance creation examine the **azdata.log**:
 
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.azdata/logs/azdata.log   #(ctrl+C to stop monitoring)
   tail -n 200  ~/.azdata/logs/azdata.log
   ```

1. Examine one or more Pods to see if you can find the answers there. Look at the pod STATUS and see if it is anything other than *Running*. Also look at the Ready column and see how many of the pods are in the state (e.g. 2/3 means two of the three pods are ready and available). Then you can describe a pod that is not in a *Running* state. Pay special attention to the Events at the very end of the **kubectl describe** output:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods 
   kubectl describe pod <pod>
   ```

1. If you discover a particular pod is the source of causing the issues, examine any logs exposed by specific containers in that pod using **kubectl logs -c <container_of_interest> <pod_of_interest>**:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -c arc-sqlmi sqlmi1-0
   ```

1. You can monitor the Linux system log live or you can examine it after the completion of a MIAA creation:

   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/syslog
   tail -n 200 /var/log/syslog
   ```

1. If no obvious issues are found in SQL Managed Instance pods, or if you cannot find a clear reason there, examine the Kubernetes events for possible root cause:

   ```bash
   kubectl get events -n kube-system
   kubectl get events -n <arc namespace>
   ```

1. You can also examine Docker container state and docker logs for possible issue with Docker itself. First find the running containers and pick a name using docker ps. Then examine the logs for that container using **docker logs <cotainer>**. For example:

   ```bash
   docker ps  
   docker logs k8s_kibana_logsui-xl8qw_arc_6f74c04f-e1ea-47f1-924e-0ff971ef6981_2
   ```

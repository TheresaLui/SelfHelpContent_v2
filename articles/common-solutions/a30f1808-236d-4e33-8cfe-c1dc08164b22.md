# Connect to SMB Share

On your Windows Server client connected to your Data Box Gateway, connect to an SMB share by entering the commands:

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In a command window, type: `net use \\<IP address of the device>\<share name> /u:<user name for the share>`
1. Enter the password for the share when prompted. The sample output of this command is presented here:

```

C: \Users\GatewayUser>net use \\10.10.10.60\newtestuser /u:Tota11yNewUser 
Enter the password for 'TotallyNewUser' to connect to '10.10.10.60'  
The command completed successfully. 
C: \Users\GatewayUser>
```
2. On your keyboard, select Windows + R
3. In the Run window, specify the \\<device IP address> and then select OK. File Explorer opens. You should now be able to view the shares that you created as folders. In File Explorer, double-click a share (folder) to view the content.

# Connect to SMB Share

First, check that the share on the appliance is configured same way as the cloud container. For example, if shared as a PageBlob, then the cloud container should also be a PageBlob; and if shared as a BlockBlob, the cloud container should be the same. 

## **Recommended Steps**

On the Windows Server client connected to your Data Box Gateway, connect to an SMB share.

1. Ensure that you can resolve the device name either by creating a DNS entry or an entry in the host file.
2. In a command window, type: `net use \\<IP address of the device>\<share name> /u:<user name for the share>`
3. Enter the password for the share when prompted. Following is a sample output of the command:

```

C: \Users\GatewayUser>net use \\10.10.10.60\newtestuser /u:Tota11yNewUser 
Enter the password for 'TotallyNewUser' to connect to '10.10.10.60'  
The command completed successfully. 
C: \Users\GatewayUser>
```

4. On your keyboard, select Windows + R
5. In the **Run** window, specify the ```\\<device IP address>``` and select **OK**.  The shares you created appear in File Explorer as folders. Double-click a share to view the contents.

# Authorization error when trying to connect 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the devices were connecting the previous day and are able to create new connections, time sync could be the issue. If the device connecting time differs by more than 5 minutes from the server, the TLS connection will be refused. 

2. Try the following steps: 
- Restart the device. Some operating systems perform a time sync as part of the restart process. 
- Perform an NTP sync

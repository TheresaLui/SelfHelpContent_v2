# Problems with Model Explanations in MLOps/Model Registry
Most users are able to resolve their model explanation issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Uploading a model explanation dashboard from the SDK

1. Create a training script in a Jupyter notebook to submit a [remote explanation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-aml#generate-feature-importance-values-via-remote-runs) by setting up AzureML Compute target as your compute target and submitting your remote run
2. Register your original model by following the steps in [Deploy models with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-and-where)

The steps shown in these [sample notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/explain-model/azure-integration/remote-explanation) may be useful.

### Accessing the model explanation dashboard from the Model Registry UI

If you registered your original model, go into Azure Machine Learning studio and you can select "Models" in the left pane to view your registered models
1. Select your model
2. Select the 'Explanations' tab to view the explanation visualization dashboard

# Create workspace

Most customers can successfully create a Log Analytics workspace using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps** 

* Make sure that you have Log Analytics Contributor permissions
* Create the Log Analytics workspace in a supported [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=monitor&regions=all)
* When creating the workspace, if you get the error "This workspace name is already in use," the cause may be one of the following reasons:
	* The workspace name is already in use (that is, it isn't available)
	* The workspace was deleted in the last 14 days and its name is reserved for the soft-delete period. To override the soft-delete period, delete the workspace, and create a new workspace with the same name, do the following:

      1. [Recover the workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace#recover-workspace)
      2. [Permanently delete the workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/delete-workspace#permanent-workspace-delete)
      3. Create a new workspace using the deleted workspace name

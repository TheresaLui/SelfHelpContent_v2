# V2 - Triggers

Resolve common issues with Azure Pipeline triggers in V2 by reviewing the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Pipelines and triggers have a _many-to-many_ relationship:
    * A pipeline can be kicked off by multiple triggers
    * A trigger can kick off multiple pipelines simultaneously

1. There are three types of triggers available in Azure Data Factory:
    * Schedule trigger: It invokes pipelines on a clock schedule
    * Tumbling Window trigger: It operates on a periodic interval, while also _retaining state_
    * Event-based trigger: It responds to an event

1. Note the difference between _Schedule_ and _Tumbling Window_ triggers. For a detailed comparison, review [Trigger Type Comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers#trigger-type-comparison).
1. To create a dependency for a tumbling window trigger, refer to these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/tumbling-window-trigger-dependency) 
1. Event-based triggers allows users to ignore _zero-byte blob_. To create an event-based trigger, see the tutorials in the following section.

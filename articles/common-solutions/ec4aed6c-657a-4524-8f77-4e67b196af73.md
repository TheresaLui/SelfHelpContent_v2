# V2 - Triggers

Resolve common issues with DataFactory triggers in V2 by reviewing the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Pipelines and triggers relationship can vary by trigger type:
    * Make sure only one pipeline is linked to a Tumbling Window Trigger(TWT)
    * More than 1 pipelines can be linked to schedule triggers and event-based triggers, but make sure the linked pipelines are published.

2. For problems with starting a trigger with dependencies, make sure there are no cyclic dependencies on the trigger

3. Once a trigger is stopped, existing inProgress runs will continue to run. But NEW trigger runs will not be initiated. To cancel any inProgress runs after stopping the trigger, follow these [instructions] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-tumbling-window-trigger#cancel-tumbling-window-run)

4. 3. For problems with starting a event-based triggers trigger from REST API and SDK, we recommended to call Subscribe To Events API first, and call Get Event Subscription Status API to make sure the triggerâ€™s event subscription status is enabled before starting the trigger. Sample script to subscribe to events before starting the event trigger in CICD scenarios:[Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/continuous-integration-deployment#script)

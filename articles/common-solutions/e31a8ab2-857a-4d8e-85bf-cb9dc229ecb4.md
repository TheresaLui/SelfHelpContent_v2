# Resolve GuestAgent issues with your Windows VM

We detected the [VM GuestAgent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) for virtual machine **<!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->** is in _Not-Ready_ state. This might impact the extensions on this VM.

This issue is often seen if the WireServer IP 168.63.129.16 is blocked. This issue can also impact GuestAgent's capability to send Heartbeat signals on VMs health and process extensions.

Follow these troubleshooting steps first to identify the problem, then perform the remediation step(s) before opening a support ticket.


## **Recommended Steps**

For the machine **<!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->**, if you are unsure whether the WireServer has been blocked, you can use the steps below to test this.


### Is the IP 168.63.129.16 being blocked?
1. Use a tool such as PsPing to test whether the VM can connect to 168.63.129.16 on ports 80 and 32526.
1. If the VM doesnâ€™t connect as expected, check whether outbound communication over ports 80 and 32526 is open in your local firewall on the VM.
1. If this IP address is blocked, VM Agent may display unexpected behavior in a variety of scenarios.

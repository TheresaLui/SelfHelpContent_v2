# Azure DevOps Services buying basic access levels

## **Recommended Steps**
Most users are able to resolve their issues purchasing Azure DevOps basic or basic + test plans using the steps below.

### **Buying Azure DevOps Cloud Service**

* Are you looking to buy Azure DevOps Services? Check out our pricing [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/).
* In our basic plan, first 5 user licenses are free in Azure DevOps Services. To buy more user licenses, you must first [set up billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=azure-devops).
* Prerequisites needed to set up billing and buy Azure DevOps user licenses are listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/overview?view=azure-devops#prerequisites)
* You can increase or decrease user licenses by updating the quantity to the desired quantity in your [billing experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=azure-devops)
* If you are looking to change access levels, find out how to do it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#manage-users)

### **Buying Azure DevOps Server**

* If you are looking to buy Azure DevOps Server, check out [pricing and how to purchase here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/server/)
* For Azure DevOps Server, you can pay month-to-month through Azure or you can buy classic software licenses which requires a 3-year commitment. Buying through Azure provides bonus of entitling you to use our cloud service, so you can move to the cloud at your own pace.

### **Basic + Test Plans trial**

* You can start a free trial to try Azure Test Plans for 30 days. Check out the details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/try-additional-features-vs?view=azure-devops).
* During the trial period, assign users Basic or Basic + Test Plans, and they can access Test Plans during the trial. Assigning Basic + Test Plans requires that you [set up billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=azure-devops) first. But, charges for those users don't start until the trial expires.

# Delete SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc resource

Most users are able to resolve their issues with deleting or deploying a SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc using the recommended steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. You can use the **--debug** switch to get verbose information about the progress of an instance deletion. For example: 

   ```bash
   azdata arc sql mi delete -n sqlmi4 --debug
   ```
1. After completion of a MIAA-instance deletion examine the **azdata.log**:

   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.azdata/logs/azdata.log   #(ctrl+C to stop monitoring)
   tail -n 200  ~/.azdata/logs/azdata.log
   ```
1. List the Managed Instances installed on the system to see if the instance is successfully deleted:

   ```bash
   azdata arc sql mi list
   kubectl get sqlmi
   ```

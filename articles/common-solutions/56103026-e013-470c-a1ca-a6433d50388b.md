# Security - SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc

Most users are able to resolve their security issues with SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc using the recommended documents below.

## **Recommended Steps**

Managed Instance Azure Arc (MIAA) supports SQL Server authentication currently. Therefore, most commonly the issues with authentication are related to using correct user name and password. 

Examine this [Login Failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-18456-database-engine-error) document and pay particular attention to the error State. For example in this error, State =2 which means "User ID is not valid"

```bash
Msg 18456, Level 14, State 2, Server <computer_name>, Line 1"
"Login failed for user '<user_name>'."

```

**Note** Currently only SQL authentication enabled for Managed Instance Azure Arc. See on [Authentication Modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode)

## **Recommended Documents**

- For encrypting data inside SQL Server refer to [Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/sql-server-encryption) document.

- For Auditing please review [SQL Server Audit](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine)

- For information on Authentication access in SQL Server refer to [Getting Started with Database Engine Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/getting-started-with-database-engine-permissions)

- [Securing SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/securing-sql-server)

**NOTE**  [TLS-encrypted connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine) of data over the wire is not currently supported in Managed Instance Azure Arc

# Connect to Local UI

The Local UI is essential for the device management

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Configure the Ethernet adapter on your computer to connect to the Azure Stack Edge device with a static IP address of 192.168.100.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0
2. Connect the computer to PORT 1 on your device
3. Open a browser window and access the local web UI of the device at https://192.168.100.10. This action may take a few minutes after you've turned on the device. You see an error or a warning indicating that there is a problem with the website's security certificate.
4. Select Continue to this webpage. These steps might vary depending on the browser you're using.
5. Sign in to the web UI of your device. The default password is Password1.

# Azure Migrate: Server migration replication issues

Most users resolved replication issues by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Agentless replication of VMware virtual machines**
Before you start, review the following documents:<br>
- [Permissions required for agentless VMware migration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151432)**
- [Common questions related to the Azure Migrate: Server Migration tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151546)**

### **Common issues and solutions**

* **Start replication fails with an error:**<br>
   Deployment validation failed with multiple errors: "Authentication failed for template resource migratelsa****/..."
   
   Azure Migrate creates a Key Vault to manage access keys to the replication storage account in your subscription. To create the vault, set permissions for **Owner**, or **Contributor and User Access Administrator** on the resource group in which the Azure Migrate project resides.

* **Start replication fails with a Key Vault operation error**<br>
   * "Key Vault operation failed. Operation is Configure managed storage account."
   * "Key Vault operation failed. Operation is Generate shared access signature definition."

   These errors happen if the logged-in user doesn't have the necessary permissions to configure storage accounts that will be managed by the Key Vault. Provide the necessary Key vault permissions by using the following PowerShell snippet:

```
$userPrincipalId = $(Get-AzureRmADUser -UserPrincipalName "loggedinuser").Id
Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName "keyvaultname" -ObjectId $userPrincipalId -PermissionsToStorage get, list, delete, set, update, regeneratekey, getsas, listsas, deletesas, setsas, recover, backup, restore, purge
```

* **I can't change the name of the VM before I start replication**<br>
   To change the name of the VM, select the VM and start replication. After initial replication is complete, select the VM, go to the **Compute and Network** blade, change the name of the VM to the new name, and select **Save**. 

* **Replication is stuck at 0%**<br>
   If multiple VMs are replicating, initial replication for the VMs will be sequenced in batches. Initial replication for VMs that are sequenced behind others may appear to be stuck at 0%. Check replication events for the VM to see if there are any errors. If there are no errors, wait for initial replication for the other VMs to complete.

* **Bandwidth throttling for replication**<br>
   Control the bandwidth used by the Azure Migrate appliance for replication by using [Windows NetQosPolicy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137869)

* **Replication cycle fails with error, "No disk snapshots were found for snapshot replication"**<br>
   This error occurs when a storage vMotion happens on a virtual machine under replication. Storage vMotion of a virtual machine under replication is currently not supported.

   - Storage vMotion the virtual machine back to its original datastore to allow subsequent replication cycles to proceed
   - Alternatively, stop replication for the virtual machine and configure replication again. This is equivalent to a fresh replication of the virtual machine after the storage vMotion.

# Managed Instance Azure Arc Limitations and Feature Availability

## **Recommended Steps**

- [List of Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#features-of-azure-arc-enabled-sql-managed-instance)

**Managed Instance Azure Arc Known Limitations:**

- SQL instance names can not be greater than 13 characters
- When creating a SQL instance do not use upper case in the name if you are provisioning in Azure
- You cannot delete/create the SQL Managed instance from the Azure portal
- SQL Server authentication only (no AD authentication)
- Managed Instance Azure Arc supports linked servers to SQL Servers only. No other Linked Server providers can be installed
- TCP/IP Sockets protocol support only (no Named Pipes)
- Always ON Availability group not currently supported. Will be added in a future release

For more information on unsupported engine features please review [Unsupported Features and Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#Unsupported).

**Containers and Kubernetes:**

- Arc enabled data services container images are not signed. You may need to configure your Kubernetes nodes to allow unsigned container images to be pulled. For example, if you are using Docker as the runtime, you can set the  - DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0 environment variable and restart. Other container runtimes have similar options such as in [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/openshift_images/image-configuration.html#images-configuration-file_image-configuration).
- Setting automated updates and turning on Advanced Data Security from the Azure portal is not available currently. It will be enabled a future release.
- VM deployments are restricted to Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
- Basic authentication only (no AD authentication)
- Deploying on OpenShift requires relaxed permissions
- No in-place upgrade for the Azure Arc data controller
- Kubernetes clusters with a mix of Linux and Windows nodes are not supported for now

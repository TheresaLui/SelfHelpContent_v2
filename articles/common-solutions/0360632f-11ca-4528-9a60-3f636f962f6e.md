# Private Link and Service Endpoint

Refer to the following limitations when setting up private links and Service Endpoints for App Service.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Setting up a private link for App Service:
* Private endpoint can only be accessed from the VNET(and the connected network) in which the private endpoint is created.
* App Service is not available over its public endpoint. Attempting this will result in the message "HTTP 403".
* Check the DNS resolution from the client that is accessing the App Service private endpoint. It should resolve to the private IP assigned from the private endpoint---only then will the app be accessible.
* Remote debugging is currently not available with Private Endpoints.
* Private Endpoints is not available for slots.

### Setting up Service Endpoints for App Service:
* If remote debugging is performed from an Azure Virtual Machine, then disable **Microsoft.Web** service endpoint on the subnet that corresponds to that Virtual Machine.

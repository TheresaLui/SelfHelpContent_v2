# How can I understand my workspace’s billed costs? 

To understand what you have actually been billed, Azure provides a great deal of useful functionality in the [Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/quick-acm-cost-analysis?toc=/azure/billing/TOC.json) hub. For instance, the **Cost analysis** functionality enables you to view your spends for Azure resources. To track your spend, add a filter by resource type (to ```microsoft.operationalinsights/workspace``` for **Log Analytics**). 

You can gain additional understanding of your usage by [downloading your usage from the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#download-usage-in-azure-portal).
Follow these instructions:
1. In the downloaded spreadsheet, view the usage per Azure resource (e.g., **Log Analytics** workspace) per day. 
1. To find usage from your Log Analytics workspaces, filter on the **Meter Category** column to show **Insights and Analytics** (used by some of the legacy pricing tiers) and **Log Analytics**. 
1. Add a filter on the **Instance ID** column called ```contains workspace```. 
The usage appears in the **Consumed Quantity** column and the unit for each entry appears in the **Unit of Measure** column. 
For more information, see [understand your Microsoft Azure bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill) and [its Log Analytics details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#viewing-log-analytics-usage-on-your-azure-bill). 

## Reducing billed costs

The way Log Analytics calculates your bill is by the amount of data ingested and for data retained beyond the retention period included, without costs for your workspace. 

### Reducing costs from data ingestion

To reduce costs from data ingestion, it helps to [understand the source of the data ingested into your workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understanding-ingested-data-volume). Then, depending on the source of the data, you can [take steps to reduce the data volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#tips-for-reducing-data-volume).

### Reducing costs from data retention

To reduce costs from data retention, you must retain your data for less time. You can do this either by [reducing the workspace's default retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#default-retention) or by [reducing the retention for a subset of the data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#retention-by-data-type). 

Note that the Log Analytics [purge API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspacepurge/purge) does not affect retention billing and is intended to be used for very limited cases.

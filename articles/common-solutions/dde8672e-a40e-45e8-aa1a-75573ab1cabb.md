# How can I understand my workspace’s billed costs? 

To understand what you have actually been billed, Azure provides a great deal of useful functionality in the [Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/quick-acm-cost-analysis?toc=/azure/billing/TOC.json) hub. For instance, the 'Cost analysis' functionality enables you to view your spends for Azure resources. Adding a filter by resource type (to microsoft.operationalinsights/workspace for Log Analytics) will allow you to track your spend. 

Additional understanding of your usage can be gained by [downloading your usage from the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#download-usage-in-azure-portal). In the downloaded spreadsheet you can see usage per Azure resource (e.g. Log Analytics workspace) per day. In this Excel spreadsheet, usage from your Log Analytics workspaces can be found by first filtering on the 'Meter Category' column to show 'Insights and Analytics' (used by some of the legacy pricing tiers) and 'Log Analytics', and then adding a filter on the 'Instance ID' column which is 'contains workspace'. The usage is shown in the 'Consumed Quantity' column and the unit for each entry is shown in the 'Unit of Measure' column. More details are available to help you [understand your Microsoft Azure bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill) and [its Log Analytics details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#viewing-log-analytics-usage-on-your-azure-bill).

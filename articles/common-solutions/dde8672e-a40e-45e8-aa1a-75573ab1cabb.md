# Understand my workspaces billed costs

### **How can I view my workspaceâ€™s billed costs?**

To understand what you have actually been billed, Azure provides a powerful tool with [Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/quick-acm-cost-analysis?toc=/azure/billing/TOC.json) hub. 

For instance, the **Cost analysis** functionality enables you to view your spends for Azure resources. To track your spend, add a filter by resource type (to ```microsoft.operationalinsights/workspace``` for **Log Analytics** workspaces and ```microsoft.operationalinsights/cluster``` for **Log Analytics** clusters). 

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#viewing-log-analytics-usage-on-your-azure-bill) about using Azure Cost Management + Billing to understand your Log Analytics costs. 

### **Understanding your Log Analytics bill**

To gain additional understanding of your billed usage, follow these instructions: 

1. [Download your usage from the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#download-usage-in-azure-portal).
1. In the downloaded spreadsheet, view the usage per Azure resource (e.g., **Log Analytics** workspace) per day. 
1. To find usage from your Log Analytics workspaces, filter on the **Meter Category** column to show **Insights and Analytics** (used by some of the legacy pricing tiers), **Log Analytics** and **Azure Monitor**. 
1. Add a filter on the **Instance ID** column called ```contains workspace```. 
The usage appears in the **Consumed Quantity** column and the unit for each entry appears in the **Unit of Measure** column. 
For more information, see [understand your Microsoft Azure bill](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill) and [its Log Analytics details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#viewing-log-analytics-usage-on-your-azure-bill). 

### **Analyzing the sources of your ingested data***

Generally most of the costs to use Log Analytics are from data ingestion. Here are some queries to help you analyze the source of your ingested data. 

You can run the following query to check which **solutions** and **data types** are sending the most billed data in the last full day:

```
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(2d)
| where StartTime >= startofday(ago(1d)) and EndTime < startofday(now())
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize DataVolumeGB = sum(Quantity)/1000. by Solution, DataType
| sort by DataVolumeGB desc nulls last
```

You can run this query to determine the volume of billable data per **computer**:

```
find where TimeGenerated > ago(24h) project _BilledSize, _IsBillable, Computer
| where _IsBillable == true 
| extend computerName = tolower(tostring(split(Computer, '.')[0]))
| summarize BillableDataBytes = sum(_BilledSize) by  computerName 
| sort by BillableDataBytes desc nulls last
```

You can run this query to determine the volume of billable data per **Azure resource**:

```
find where TimeGenerated > ago(24h) project _ResourceId, _BilledSize, _IsBillable
| where _IsBillable == true 
| summarize BillableDataBytes = sum(_BilledSize) by _ResourceId 
| sort by BillableDataBytes desc nulls last
```

### **How to reduce billed costs**

The way Log Analytics calculates your bill is by the amount of data ingested and for data retained beyond the retention period included, without costs for your workspace. 

* **Reduce costs from data ingestion**

   To reduce costs from data ingestion, you must [understand the source of the data ingested into your workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#understanding-ingested-data-volume). Then, depending on the source of the data, you can [take steps to reduce the data volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#tips-for-reducing-data-volume) which depend on .

* **Reduce costs from data retention**

   To reduce costs from data retention, you must retain your data for less time. You can do this either by [reducing the workspace's default retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#default-retention) or by [reducing the retention for a subset of the data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#retention-by-data-type). Note that the Log Analytics [purge API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspacepurge/purge) does not affect retention billing and is intended to be used for very limited cases.

# Permission denied accessing job input or output data

Job input and output data is stored in an Azure Storage account that is deployed in the same subscription as your workspace. This storage account is associated with the Quantum Workspace at creation time.

Because the storage account remains a separate resource, you may experience various types of permission issues trying to access it. Most users can resolve these issues by following the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Review the input and output data links on the job that you're trying to access. These data links contain the storage account name as part of the URL.
2. Review the permission settings on the storage account
3. To reconfigure permissions, follow the instructions in the blob storage [authorization resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/authorization-resource-provider?#assign-management-permissions-with-azure-role-based-access-control-azure-rbac) documentation

# Inviting Users 

Resolve common issues around inviting users by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Are you unable to invite new users to your organization, project, or team?** <br>
Make sure you have the necessary [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#prerequisites).

**Why are "no identities found" when I try to add users from Azure AD to my Azure DevOps Organization?** <br>
Are you an Azure AD guest user? [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-why-are-no-identities-found-when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization). 

**I received an invitation, but I’m having issues accessing the organization or project**<br>

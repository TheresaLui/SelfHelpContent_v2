# Inviting Users 

## **Recommended Steps**

* Are you unable to invite new users to your organization, project, or team? Make sure you have the necessary [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#prerequisites).
* Why are there no identities found when I try to add users from Azure AD to my Azure DevOps Organization? Are you an Azure AD guest user? [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-why-are-no-identities-found-when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization). 
*  I received an invitation, but I’m having issues accessing the organization and/or project:
    *   Sign out of your browser. To do so, select the Visual Studio sign out link.
    *   Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del.
    *   Open your browser and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses browser cookies.
    *   Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE
    *   Use a private browser session to retry the connection. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it.
    *   Check out [the guide for troubleshooting connectivity issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/user-guide/troubleshoot-connection?view=azure-devops)
* For service impacting issues, please check [Azure DevOps Services Status](https://status.dev.azure.com)

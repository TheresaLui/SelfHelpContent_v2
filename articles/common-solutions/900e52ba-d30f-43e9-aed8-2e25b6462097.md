# Performing an operation on the jobs in a workspace yields a 'Permission Denied' (403 Forbidden) error code

Azure Quantum uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access rights for users and entities. You may receive an error if your workspace permissions are not configured correctly.

To submit jobs or change the workspace in any way, you must at least have Contributor (or equivalent) access to the workspace.

Most users can resolve issues regarding a "Permission Denied (403 Forbidden)" error code by following the steps below. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you're new to RBAC permissions, start by reviewing the [general RBAC documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/)
2. View the **Access control (IAM)** blade of your quantum workspace to see the existing access configuration
3. Use the **View Access** option to check your effective access
4. Ensure that you have the permissions required to complete the operation that you're attempting
5. After verifying that you have the correct permissions in the Azure Portal, ensure that you're using the same user account in the client tool that you're using to perform Azure Quantum operations
6. If your issue persists, start a support ticket and one of our team members will assist you

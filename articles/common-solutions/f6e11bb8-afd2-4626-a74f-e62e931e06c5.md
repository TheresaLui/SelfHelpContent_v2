# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

* **What is Azure Active Directory B2C?** 

   Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day. It takes care of the scaling and safety of the authentication platform, monitoring and automatically handling threats like denial-of-service, password spray, and brute force attacks. [Learn more features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) and [try our demo](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview#example-woodgrove-groceries). 

   Get started by [creating an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 

* **I am unable to create B2C tenant with error message "the subscription is not registered to use namespace Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory"** 

   Add **Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory** as a resource provider for the Azure subscription in use. [Steps to Register resource provider via the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1).

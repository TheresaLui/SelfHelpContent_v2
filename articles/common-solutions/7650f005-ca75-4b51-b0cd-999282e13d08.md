# Resolving IOT Edge Runtime Error
If you're running an older version of IoT Edge, then upgrading may resolve your issue. The iotedge check tool checks that the IoT Edge security daemon is the latest version, but does not check the versions of the IoT Edge hub and agent modules. To check the version of the runtime modules on your device, use the commands iotedge logs edgeAgent and iotedge logs edgeHub. The version number is declared in the logs when the module starts up.

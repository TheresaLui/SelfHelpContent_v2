# My Issue Is not listed
## **Recommended Steps**

The following information can help you resolve the most common issues.

**If you have questions on registering apps**
*  [Register my app to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) and [configure properties for my app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-configure)
*  Get a [list of all applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureadapplication?view=azureadps-2.0) & [all service principal objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/get-azureadserviceprincipal?view=azureadps-2.0) through PowerShell
* [Understand the difference between App Registration & Enterprise Applications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54071385/difference-between-enterprise-application-and-app-registration-in-azure)
* [Restrict who can create/consent to applications or assign owner to application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-app-roles)
* [Learn about delegated & application permissions & consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes)
* [Understand which permissions are required to register an app and how to do this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#permissions-required-for-registering-an-app)

**If you're having issues related to Enterprise Applications blade**
* [Signing into my SAML based single sign-on configured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/troubleshoot-sign-in-saml-based-apps#authentication-method-by-which-the-user-authenticated-with-the-service-doesnt-match-requested-authentication-method)
* [Registering my application through Oauth](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code)

**If you're having issues finding your applications or seeing unknown applications**
* I can’t find my application under App Registration - Application might be multi-tenant app registered in another tenant. You would find it in Enterprise Apps blade after it has been accessed (& consented) and [service principal has been created in your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)
* [I see an unexpected application in my applications list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-types?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Enterprise_Apps_Support_L2_Overview) and [want to know more about it](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-types?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Enterprise_Apps_Support_L2_Overview)
* As Owner, I can’t view app under App Registration
   - Disable the setting ['Restrict access to Azure admin portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)
   - Or, [assign the admin role to the owner for only that specific application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)

* [How do I ensure that the application is publisher verified to avoid consent errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview) 
* Learn about [Admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-admin-consent) & how the [consent prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-admin-consent) works
*  [Evaluate a request for tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests#evaluating-a-request-for-tenant-wide-admin-consent) & [How to Grant tenant-wide admin consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent#:~:text=The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API.&text=before%20granting%20consent.-,The%20Global%20Administrator%20role%20is%20required%20in%20order%20to%20provide,to%20the%20Microsoft%20Graph%20API)

**If you're unable to associate the Partner Center MPN ID with your application, OR you need to verify your app publisher**
* [Verify app's publisher domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain#to-verify-a-new-domain-for-your-app) and ensure MPN Id must be for [Partner global account](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/account-structure)
* Learn [pre-requisites for Publisher verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview#requirements) and [Publisher verification - overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview)
* [Publish my app to the Azure AD App gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-howto-app-gallery-listing) and [mark my app publisher verified](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/mark-app-as-publisher-verified)

# Authentication methods - Authenticator App

### Resolve problems with the Sign-in Diagnostic

You can quickly find out what happened or diagnose problems related to user sign-in by using the the [Sign-in Diagnostic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/diagnose/symptomId/ms_aad_dxp_signin_caDiagnoseAndSolveSummarySymptom).  

1. Start the Sign-in Diagnostic.
2. Find the event to analyze by entering the details you have about the user, application, time of sign-in, request Id, or correlation Id.
3. Review the diagnostic results of what happened and what actions you can take to make changes, if  changes are needed.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If a user doesn't get a push notification in the Microsoft Authenticator app, verify that their name doesn't appear under the MFA blocked users as described in [Block and unblock users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#block-and-unblock-users).

2. If the user is not blocked for MFA but does not receive a push notification, they can open the Microsoft Authenticator app, which will pull the pending approval requests.	

3. As an alternative sign-in method, the user can select **Sign in another way** and choose **use a verification code from my mobile app**.

4. If the user is prompted to match a code in the app to one on the sign-in screen, but the codes aren't shown in the app, the user will need to update to the latest version of the app available in the store.

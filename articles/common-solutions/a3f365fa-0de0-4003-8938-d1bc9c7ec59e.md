# SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Refresh and Queries Performance
Most customers can resolve issues related to Refresh and Queries Performance in SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) by using these steps.


## **Recommended Steps**

- **SSAS intermittently stops responding during processing or refresh**<br>
    This problem can occur when multiple processing requests running at the same time inadvertantly block each other. For more details, see [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/blog-analysis-services-stop-accept-new-connection?view=asallproducts-allversions#another-variation-multiple-processing-requests-can-block-each-other). Once you identify a solution, let us know if you have any suggestions on ways we can improve our documentation.

- **SSAS refresh or processing error: "OLE DB or ODBC error: Operation canceled; HY008"**<br>
    When refreshing or processing data, SSAS sends queries to the data source to retrieve data, which can result in a timeout. Review common errors and their mitigation at [Operation canceled error](https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/jason_howell/analysis-services-cube-processing-fails-with-error-ole-db-error-ole-db-or-odbc-error-operation-canceled-hy008).

- **SSAS refresh or processing error: "OLE DB or ODBC error: Protocol error in TDS stream; HY000; Protocol error in TDS stream; HY000; Protocol error in TDS stream; HY000; Communication link failure; 08S01; TCP Provider: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host."**<br>
   This issue can happen when SSAS tries to connect to a SQL Engine as a data source and the connection fails with communication link failure.  Most common issues can be resolved by [the information in this blog](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/b26af923-733a-408e-8b2f-1943d2ff74c1/tcp-provider-an-existing-connection-was-forcibly-closed-by-the-remote-host).

- **How to automate partition management for Analysis services Tabular Models**<br>
   - Review [Automate partition management for Analysis Services Tabular models](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-as-automated-partition-management).
   - Collect data on the Analysis Services server when a problem occurs by running the [SSASDiag Data Collection Tool](https://github.com/ssasdiag/SSASDiag/releases). This data can be used for cause analysis.

# SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc Connectivity

Most users are able to resolve their connectivity issues with SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc using the recommended documents below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Linked Servers

Connectivity of linked servers in Managed Instance Azure Arc can be achieved by using the IP address and port - the external endpoint.

1. To get the external endpoint use the following command

   ```bash
   azdata arc sql mi list
   ```

1. Once you find the endpoint you can configure a linked server to that Managed Instance using a script similar to the example below, where you pass IP address, Port to the @datasrc parameter.

   ```SQL
   EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver
      @server = N'SQLMIAA2-0',
      @srvproduct=N'',
      @provider=N'MSOLEDBSQL',
      @datasrc=N'172.29.14.05,31190'
   ```

1. To add the security credentials for linked server use the remote user option with the SQL authentication account

   ```sql
   EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin
      @rmtsrvname=N'SQLMIAA2-0',
      @useself=N'False',
      @locallogin=NULL,
      @rmtuser=N'sa',
      @rmtpassword='########'
   ```

1. Test the linked server

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_testlinkedserver  @servername  = N'SQLMIAA2-0'
   ```

**Note:** For  MI-AA instances which are deployed in Azure VM, you need to add the port in VM network security group (NSG) group with both inbound and outbound rules. That it will make it possible to connect between MI-AA instances using Linked server.

***Warning:*** This is a potential security risk as it opens up ports. You must assess this based on your specific needs.

# How can I select the best pricing tier for my workspace?

In the Azure portal, open **Usage and estimated costs** from your workspace. Here you'll see a list of pricing tiers available to your workspace. Review the estimated costs if the workspace was in each of the pricing tiers based on the last 31 days of usage. This will guide you to the most cost-effective pricing tier. Note that if you own OMS Suite licenses, you can leverage your licenses your workspace by putting them in the legacy Per Node pricing tier. If your workspace has access to the legacy Per Node pricing tier, you can evaluate whether this is a good choice for you by using [this query](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#evaluating-the-legacy-per-node-pricing-tier).

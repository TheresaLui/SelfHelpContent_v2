# See slow performance when reading or writing to shares

If performance is slow when your device reads or writes to shares, update to the latest release of Azure Stack Edge.

Performance issues can occur when uploading a dataset whose files are large in size relative to the available bandwidth. In particular, this can happen when bandwidth throttling is active.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Update your device to the latest version
* For optimum performance, ensure that the regions where the storage accounts stores the Azure Stack Edge data is close to where the device is located 


## **Recommended Documents**

* [Destination storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-overview#region-availability)

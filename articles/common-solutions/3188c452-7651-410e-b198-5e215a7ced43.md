# Slow Performance

The latest release for Azure Stack Edge addresses data upload speed issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This problem can occur when uploading a dataset that primarily consists of files that are large in size relative to available bandwidth, particularly, but not limited to, when bandwidth throttling is active
2. This release fixes an upload problem where upload restarts due to failures can slow the rate of upload completion
3. This change ensures that sufficient opportunity is given for upload completion before restarting upload for a given file

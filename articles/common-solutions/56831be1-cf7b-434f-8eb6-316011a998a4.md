# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended steps**

* **In which country or region can Azure AD B2C store my data?** 

   Azure AD B2C is available worldwide via the Azure public cloud with the option for data residency in the United States, Europe, or Asia Pacific. 

   This differs from the model followed by most other Azure services, which typically couples availability with data residency. You can see examples of this on the Azure [Products Available By Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/) page and in the [Active Directory B2C pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-b2c/). 

   Data residency refers to where user data is stored. See the [List of available regions](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory-b2c/data-residency#data-residency).

# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **In which country or region Azure AD B2C stores my data?** 

Azure AD B2C is available worldwide via the Azure public cloud with the option for data residency in the United States, Europe, or Asia Pacific. 

This differs from the model followed by most other Azure services, which typically couple availability with data residency. You can see examples of this in both Azure's [Products Available By Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/) page and the [Active Directory B2C pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-b2c/). 

Data residency refers to where user data is stored. [List of available regions](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory-b2c/data-residency#data-residency).

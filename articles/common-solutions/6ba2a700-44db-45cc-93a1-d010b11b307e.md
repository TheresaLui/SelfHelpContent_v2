# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Using the investigation graph

## **Recommended Steps**

The investigation graph helps you understand the scope, and identify the root cause of a potential security threat by correlating relevant data with any involved entity. 
You can dive deeper and investigate any entity presented in the graph by selecting it and choosing between different expansion options or navigating to the entity page.

1. Investigation graph is unavailable:
	1. You'll only be able to investigate the incident if you used the entity mapping fields when you set up your analytics rule. 
	The investigation graph requires that your original incident includes entities. 
	2. Check if the analytic rule contains the required 'entity mapping' configurations and if the fields are mapped correctly to the entities you wish to see. 
	To learn more about entity mapping  and entities in Sentinel click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics#entities-in-azure-sentinel).

2. Investigated entities are being duplicated:
	Sometimes, entities coming from alerts, do not include proper identification as being same entity. 
	For example, a user is being identified by UPN in one alert, and username and domain name in another alert. 
	Sentinel will not be able to identify those two entities as the same one, unless their identifiers are the same or AAD data can help identifying them as one.
	1. Make sure AAD sync is activated â€“ this is done in Settings -> Entity behavior analytics.
	2. Check the entity identifier, as they appear in the relevant alerts and make sure that there is sufficient data to match those entities. An entity is part of an alert, 
	and the parameters of that entity can be found in the log containing the alert.

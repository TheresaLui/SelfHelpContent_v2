# LiveData Platform for Azure - Induction issues

## **Recommended Steps**

Most customers resolve their Induction related issues with LiveData Platform on their own, using the links below:

* [Please verify if traffic over the following ports is allowed between your On-Premise Zone and Azure Zone](https://wandiscosheffield.github.io/wandisco-documentation-private/docs/az-network-troubleshooting/#azure-security-resource-groups)
- **6444** DConE port handles all coordination traffic that manages replication. It needs to be open between all Fusion nodes.
- **7000 + 9001** These are used for data transfer between the Fusion Server and IHC servers. It must be accessible from all Fusion nodes in the replicated system.
- **8082 (8084 if SSL enabled)** The REST port is used by the Fusion application for configuration and reporting, both internally and via REST API. The port needs to be open between all Fusion nodes and any systems or scripts that interface with Fusion through the REST API.
* [RetryError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='management.azure.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded](https://wandiscosheffield.github.io/wandisco-documentation-private/docs/troubleshooting/#connect-your-on-premises-zone-to-your-azure-zone-induction)

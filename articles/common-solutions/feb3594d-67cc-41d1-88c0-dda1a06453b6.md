# I'm unable to configure network settings

If you're unable to configure network settings, follow the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

- If DHCP is enabled in your environment, network interfaces are automatically configured. An IP address, a subnet, a gateway, and a DNS are automatically assigned.
- If DHCP isn't enabled, you can assign static IPs, if needed
- You can configure your network interface as IPv4
- Note the Multi homing is not supported for ASE devices and also each port needs to be configured for separate functions.

# Power BI 404 Error 

If you are attempting to use the Power BI Connector from Time Series Insights Explorer for your Gen2 environment and you are experiencing 404 errors it could be for the following reasons:

* Your environment does not have Warm Store enabled
* You have guest access to the environment from another Azure AD Tenant

## **Recommended Steps**

* Enable Warm Store in the environment. Power BI Connector currently only supports queries made against Warm Store. 
* Make sure you have access to the environment from the Data Access Policies tab in Azure Portal

## **Recommended Documents**

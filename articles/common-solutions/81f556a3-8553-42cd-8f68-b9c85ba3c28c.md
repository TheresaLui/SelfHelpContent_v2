# Issues with authorization and RBAC policies

Error message: You do not have sufficient permission to assign a role that is required to allow access to the resources in the selected subscription 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Azure Resource Mover managed identity needs at least these permissions:

- Permission to write/ create resources in user subscription, available with the Contributor role

- Permission to create role assignments. Typically available with the Owner or User Access Administrator roles, or with a custom role that has 
the Microsoft.Authorization/role assignments/write permission assigned.This permission isn't needed if the data share resource's managed 
identity is already granted access to the Azure data store.

- When you add resources in the Resource Mover hub in the portal, permissions are handled automatically as long as the user has the permissions described above. 
If you add resources with PowerShell, you need to manually assign them

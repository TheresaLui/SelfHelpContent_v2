# Validating and testing DDoS protection 

We have partnered with [BreakingPoint Cloud](https://www.ixiacom.com/products/breakingpoint-cloud), a self-service traffic generator, to build an interface where Azure customers can generate traffic against DDoS Protection-enabled public endpoints for simulations. You can use the simulation to:

* Validate how Azure DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
* Optimize your incident response process while under DDoS attack.
* Document DDoS compliance.
* Train your network security teams.

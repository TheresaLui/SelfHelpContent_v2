# Seamless SSO user sign-in issues

Most users are able to resolve their Seamless Single Sign-on user login issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

After the user is authenticated, the browser will cache the user credential, so that on the same browser, the application will automatically sign-in with the same account. This may make it difficult for another user or a single user to log into multiple accounts on one device.
1. Try signing in on another browser
2. Clear the browser's cache and/or cookies and try signing in again

If you are still experiencing sign-in issues, we recommend the following to diagnose and automate the resolution steps:

1. Install the [My Apps Secure Browser Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/access-panel-extension-problem-installing) to help Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide better diagnosis and resolutions when using the testing experience in the Azure portal.
2. Reproduce the error using the testing experience in the app configuration page in the Azure portal. Learn more about [Debug SAML-based single sign-on applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/howto-v1-debug-saml-sso-issues)
3. If you use the testing experience in the Azure portal with the My Apps Secure Browser Extension, you can **skip step 4**. 
4. To open the SAML-based single sign-on configuration page:
   - Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in as a Global Administrator or Coadmin.
   - Open the **Azure Active Directory Extension** by selecting **All services** at the top of the main left-side navigation menu.
   - Type "Azure Active Directory" in the filter search box and select the Azure Active Directory item.
   - Select **Enterprise Applications** from the Azure Active Directory left-hand navigation menu.
   - Select **All Applications** to view a list of all your applications. If you do not see the application you want show up here, use the **Filter** control at the top of the **All Applications List** and set the **Show** option to **All Applications**.
   - Select the application you want to configure for single sign-on.
   - After the application loads, select **Single sign-on** from the application’s left-hand navigation menu.
   - Select **SAML-based SSO**.
5. Based on the error, follow the recommended steps: [Problems signing in to SAML-based single sign-on configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-federated-sso-gallery#application-not-found-in-directory)

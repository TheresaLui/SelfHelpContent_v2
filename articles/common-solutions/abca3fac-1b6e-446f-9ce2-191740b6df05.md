# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Onboarding to Sentinel

## **Recommended Steps**
1. If you need help figuring out why your workspace failed to be created, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#create-a-workspace)

2. Make sure you are not trying to use the defualt workspace for Azure Sentinel installation. Default workspaces are created by Azure Security Center and can not be used by Azure Sentinel.

3. Azure Sentinel can run on more than one workspace, but the data is isolated to a single workspace.

4. Once deployed on a workspace, Azure Sentinel does not currently support the moving of that workspace to other resource groups or subscriptions.

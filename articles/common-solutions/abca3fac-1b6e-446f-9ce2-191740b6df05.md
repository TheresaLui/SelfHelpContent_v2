# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Onboarding to Sentinel

Resolve your workspace issue in Azure Sentinel with the following steps. 

## **Recommended Steps**
1. To figure out why your workspace failed to be created, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/he-il/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#create-a-workspace)

2. Make sure that you are not trying to use the default workspace for Azure Sentinel installation. Default workspaces are created by Azure Security Center and cannot be used by Azure Sentinel.

3. Azure Sentinel can run on more than one workspace, but the data is isolated to a single workspace.

4. After Azure Sentinel is deployed on a workspace, moving the workspace to other resource groups or subscriptions is not supported.

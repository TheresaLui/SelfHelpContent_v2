# SSL, TLS and Cipher Suites

SSL is retired and TLS is the new protocol for encrypting the data transmission between a client and a server. 
The cipher suite is what the client and server agree to use as the encryption algorithm. Both the client and server must have the cipher and the choose the strongest one starting at the top of the list.  
For companies that want to change that order, this can be accomplished on an App Service Environment (ASE) or by outsourcing the handshake to an Azure Gateway. 
Certificates can also be used for Client Certificate authentication for both inbound and outbound. This is commonly referred to a TLS mutual authentication.

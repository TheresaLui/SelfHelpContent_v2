# Azure Sentinel - Analytic rules  - Active rule issues

Resolve active rule issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Make sure that you have read/write privilege on your workspace.

2.	Refresh your browser to get the latest update of your rules.

3. Currently the number of alerts a rule can generate is capped at 20. 
If in a particular rule, **Event grouping** is set to **Trigger an alert for each event**, and the rule's query returns more than 20 events, 
each of the first 19 events will generate a unique alert. The twentieth alert will summarize the entire set of returned events. 
In other words, the twentieth alert is what would have been generated under the **Group all events into a single alert** option.

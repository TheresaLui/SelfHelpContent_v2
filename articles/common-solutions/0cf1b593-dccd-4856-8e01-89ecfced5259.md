# Connect to VMs

To perform operations on your VMs, you need to connect with the VMs first. If you encounter any issues, first verify that your VM is running by viewing your VM's console log or by taking a screenshot. Review errors in logs such as file systems table (FSTAB), file system consistency (FSC), and networking.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure that the Network Security Group allows the traffic.
2. To connect to the VM, use the the private IP that you passed during the VM creation. Open an SSH session to connect with the IP address:
 
     ```
     ssh -l <username> <ip address>
     ```
3. When prompted, provide the password that you used when creating the VM. If you need to provide the SSH key, use this command: 

    ```
     ssh -i c:/users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa Administrator@5.5.41.236
     ```
4. Reset the password to address authentication errors.
5. To restart the virtual machine to address startup issues, select **Restart** at the top of the VM resource blade.

# I'm unable to download or install updates.

We recommend that you install updates through the Azure Portal. The device automatically scans for updates once a day. When the updates are available, you see a notification in the portal. You can then download and install the updates.

Keep in mind that installing an update or hotfix restarts your device. This update requires you to apply two updates sequentially. First you apply the device software updates, and then the Kubernetes updates. Because the Azure Stack Edge Pro is a single node device, any I/O in progress is disrupted and your device will have a downtime of up to 30 minutes for the device software update.

## **Recommended Steps**

- The update dialog includes a recovery key that you should copy and save in a safe location 
- This key is used to recover your data in case the device cannot boot up
- You may need to wait several minutes for the update to successfully complete. After the update is complete, sign in to the device. The Cloud settings page will update to indicate that the device is successfully activated.

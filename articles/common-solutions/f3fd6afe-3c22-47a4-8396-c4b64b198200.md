# Suppress a security alert self-help guide
You can use alerts suppression rules to suppress false positives or other unwanted security alerts from Azure Defender.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Create a suppression rule

There are a few ways you can create rules to suppress unwanted security alerts:

* To suppress alerts at the management group level, use Azure Policy
* To suppress alerts at the subscription level, you can use the Azure portal or the REST API as explained below

**Note:** Suppression rules can only dismiss alerts that have already been triggered on the selected subscriptions.

### Create a rule directly in the Azure portal

1.	From Security Center's security alerts page: 
    - select the suppression rules link at the top of the page, and from the suppression rules page select Create new suppression rule
2.	In the new suppression rule pane, enter the details of your new rule
    - Your rule can dismiss the alert on all resources so you don't get any alerts like this one in the future
    - Your rule can dismiss the alert on specific criteria - when it relates to a specific IP address, process name, user account, Azure resource, or location
3.	Enter details of the rule:
    1. Name - A name for the rule. Rule names must begin with a letter or a number, be between 2 and 50 characters, and contain no symbols other than dashes (-) or underscores (_).
    2. State - Enabled or disabled
    3. Reason - Select one of the built-in reasons or 'other' if they don't meet your needs
    4. Expiration date - An end date and time for the rule. Rules can run for up to six months.
4.	Optionally, test the rule using the Simulate button to see how many alerts would have been dismissed if this rule had been active
5.	Save the rule

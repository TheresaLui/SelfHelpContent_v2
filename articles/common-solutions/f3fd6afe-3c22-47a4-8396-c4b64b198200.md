# Suppress a security alert self-help guide
You can use alerts suppression rules to suppress false positives or other unwanted security alerts from Azure Defender.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Create a suppression rule

There are a few ways you can create rules to suppress unwanted security alerts:

* To suppress alerts at the management group level, use Azure Policy
* To suppress alerts at the subscription level, you can use the Azure Portal or the REST API, as explained below

**Note:** Suppression rules can only dismiss alerts that have already been triggered on the selected subscriptions.

### Create a rule directly in the Azure Portal

1.	From Security Center's security alerts page: 
    - Select the suppression rules link at the top of the page, and on the suppression rules page, select **Create new suppression rule**
2.	In the new suppression rule pane, enter the details of your new rule
    - Your rule can dismiss the alert on all resources so you don't get any alerts like this one in the future
    - Your rule can dismiss the alert on specific criteria - when it relates to a specific IP address, process name, user account, Azure resource, or location
3.	Enter details of the rule:
    1. Name - A name for the rule. Rule names must begin with a letter or a number, be between 2 and 50 characters, and contain no symbols other than hyphens (-) or underscores (_).
    2. State - Enabled or disabled
    3. Reason - Select one of the built-in reasons, or **Other** if they don't meet your needs
    4. Expiration date - An end date and time for the rule. Rules can run for up to six months.
4.	Optionally, test the rule by using the **Simulate** button to see how many alerts would have been dismissed if this rule had been active
5.	Save the rule

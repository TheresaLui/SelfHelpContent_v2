# Common scenarios

Most customers can resolve common issues in Azure Data Factory using these steps.

## Troubleshoot common issues

- **Connectivity issues between the Azure IR and Source/Sink**
   Allow traffic from the IP addresses listed for the Azure Integration runtime in the specific Azure region where your resources are located. You can get an IP range list of service tags from the [service tags IP range download link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#discover-service-tags-by-using-downloadable-json-files). For example, if the Azure region is AustraliaEast, get an IP range list from DataFactory.AustraliaEast.

- **Connectivity issues between Self-Hosted IR and Source/ Sink**

   * If a corporate firewall runs on the central router of the organization, review the outbound port and domain requirements for corporate firewalls [Firewall requirements for on-premises/private network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-movement-security-considerations#firewall-requirements-for-on-premisesprivate-network)
   
   * If the problem continues, use a Netmon trace to further analyze the issue. Follow the steps in the [Network troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide#connectivity-issue-between-self-hosted-ir-and-data-factory-or-self-hosted-ir-and-data-sourcesink).
   
- **Connecting to Azure Data Factory via private endpoint**

    * This is only available for self-hosted integration runtime in data factory and is not supported in Synapse. For more details, see [Private Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-private-link)
   * A self-hosted integration runtime can run copy activities between a cloud data store and a data store in a private network. It also can dispatch transform activities against compute resources in an on-premises network or an Azure virtual network. The installation of a self-hosted integration runtime needs an on-premises machine or a virtual machine inside a private network.

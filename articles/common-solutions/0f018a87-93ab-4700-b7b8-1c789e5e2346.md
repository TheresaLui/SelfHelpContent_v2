# Common scenarios

•	When you encounter the connectivity issues between the Azure IR and Source/Sink, please allow traffic from the IP addresses listed for the Azure Integration runtime in the specific Azure region where your resources are located. You can get an IP range list of service tags from the [service tags IP range download link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#discover-service-tags-by-using-downloadable-json-files). For example, if the Azure region is AustraliaEast, you can get an IP range list from DataFactory.AustraliaEast.

•	When you encounter the connectivity issues between Self-Hosted IR and Source/ Sink, if a corporate firewall runs on the central router of the organization, the following documents provides outbound port and domain requirements for corporate firewalls [Firewall requirements for on-premises/private network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-movement-security-considerations#firewall-requirements-for-on-premisesprivate-network)

•	Connecting to Azure Data Factory via private endpoint is only applicable to self-hosted integration runtime in data factory. It's not supported in Synapse. More Detail: [Private Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-private-link)

•	A self-hosted integration runtime can run copy activities between a cloud data store and a data store in a private network. It also can dispatch transform activities against compute resources in an on-premises network or an Azure virtual network. The installation of a self-hosted integration runtime needs an on-premises machine or a virtual machine inside a private network.

•	We have listed all the connector known issues from [connector troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-troubleshoot-guide).


**Advanced Troubleshooting:** If your data sink and source has any connectivity issue from self-hosted IR, you can also take netmon trace to analyze further. Please follow the steps as well [Network troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide#connectivity-issue-between-self-hosted-ir-and-data-factory-or-self-hosted-ir-and-data-sourcesink).

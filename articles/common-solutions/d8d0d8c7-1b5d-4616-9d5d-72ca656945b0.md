# How to use Azure Function, Data Explorer, or Azure Machine Learning Activities in ADF

## **Recommended Steps**

If you have received an error code, please reference the [ADF Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-troubleshoot-guide#web-activity) and search for the code number.

* Most 3610 errors are related to failures and misconfigurations in the Azure Functions set up.
* If the Machine Learning Pipeline ID drop down doesn't show any available pipeline names or ID, then it is likely the account being used doesn't have authorization to list ML pipelines.
* Many issues are authentication based. Make sure that the Service Principal ID and/or App Id being used in the Linked Services have the correct access.

# Issue configuring automatic dependency tracking 

For all App insights SDKs, there is a minimal level of dependency tracking that covers the most common types of dependencies. For example, .NET collects SQL and HTTP dependencies, including services built on HTTP such as Storage, without much configuration. For Java, you'd need to install the Java agent. 

The following steps cover the most common monitoring scenarios. Node.JS and JavaScript natively support these without additional configuration.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Set up dependency tracking for [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-dependencies)
2. Set up dependency tracking for [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-agent)
3. Set up dependency tracking for [App service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps?tabs=net)
4. For web pages, Application Insights JavaScript SDK automatically collects AJAX calls as dependencies
5. Set up custom dependency tracking for [OpenCensus Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/opencensus-python-dependency)
6. [Dependency auto-collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/auto-collect-dependencies) includes the currently supported list of dependency calls that are automatically detected as dependencies without requiring any additional modification to your application's code 
7. If your dependency isn't on the list mentioned in the previous step, you can still track it manually with a [track dependency call](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#trackdependency)

## **Recommended Documents**
 
- [Dependency auto-collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/auto-collect-dependencies)
- [Manually track dependency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-dependencies#manually-tracking-dependencies)

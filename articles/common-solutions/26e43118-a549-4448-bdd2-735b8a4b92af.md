# Pipeline is in queued status for a long time.

## **Recommended Steps**

### If pipeline stuck in Queued status for a long time.

* If your pipeline has a concurrency policy, make sure that you don't have old pipeline runs in progress.
* Go to ADF authoring page, select your pipeline and check if it has concurrency. If it does, go to the monitoring page and make sure there's nothing in the past 45 days that's in progress.
* If you find something in progress, you can cancel it and the new pipeline run should start.

### Transient issues

It is possible that your run was impacted by a transient network issue. If this happens, we have an internal recovery process that monitors all the runs and starts them in case it notices something went wrong. This process happens every 1 hour, if your run is stuck for more than an hour please create a support case for this.

If you have an activity stuck in queued or in progress, please use the corresponding support topic in the activities section.

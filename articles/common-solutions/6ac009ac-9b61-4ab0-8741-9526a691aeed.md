Unable to apply configurations at scale on Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resources using Azure Policy

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure that you have `Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write` permissions on the scope (subscription or resource group) where you want to create this policy assignment
* Check if the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resource of concern falls under the scope (subscription/resource group) where you have assigned this policy
* Once the policy assignment is created, note that it typically takes 15 mins for the policy to be evaluated
* Configurations are automatically created for Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resources after the policy assignment. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes resources that existed before the policy assignment require a [remediation task](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources#create-a-remediation-task) to be run manually.

   MSAL.js v2 supports B2C, as of October 2020. 

   To learn more about [MSAL B2C integration FAQ](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/FAQ.md#B2C). 

* **How can I migrate an OWIN-based web API to b2clogin.com?** 

   [Learn a technique](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/multiple-token-endpoints) for enabling support for multiple token issuers in web APIs that implement the Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN).

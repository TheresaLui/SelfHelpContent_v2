Assets Insight reports are currently delayed by 6-8 hours depending on your Purview account region. The Purview Engineering team is working on this with top priority and this experience is expected to improve significantly in terms of turn around time by the time Purview goes to general availability. You can expect continuous improvement over the coming months but here is an ETA to your Asset Insights today depending on your region:
* WestEurope: ETA 8 Hours
* EastUS: ETA 6 Hours
* Other Regions: ETA 3 Hours

If you don't see your asset insights populated after more than 8 hours, please contact support.

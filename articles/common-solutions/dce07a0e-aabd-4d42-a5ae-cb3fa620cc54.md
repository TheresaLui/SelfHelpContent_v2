# Delayed assets insight reports in Purview account 

Most users are able to resolve issues with resource sets by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

Assets Insight reports are currently delayed by 6-8 hours depending on your Purview account region. Significantly improving this turnaround time is a top priority for the Purview Engineering team before Purview goes to general availability. Therefore, you can expect continuous improvement over the coming months. 

Here is an ETA for Asset Insight reports, based on region:
* WestEurope: ETA 8 Hours
* EastUS: ETA 6 Hours
* Other Regions: ETA 3 Hours

If your asset insights don't populate after more than 8 hours, contact support.

# SelfHosted IR Sharing tab not display

Sometimes customers can have this situation where they used to use a IR as `self-hosted IR`, but then they cannot find the `sharing tab`.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Firstly, what they previously used is a `self-hosted IR` which has `sharing tab`, but now what they are using is `linked IR` which doesn't have `sharing tab`. That's why they cannot see the sharing tab right now.
2. The reason for causing this change can be that customers use different mode. Say prevously customers used live mode where this IR is sefl-hosted IR, while now they are using git mode where this IR is linked IR.
3. To sum up, it's not a bug, it's because customers' config in git mode is different from the one in live mode, which can cause this problem.

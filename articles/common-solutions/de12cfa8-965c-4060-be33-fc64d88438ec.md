# SelfHosted IR Sharing tab not display

If you've been using self-hosted integration runtime (IR), but run into an issue where the Sharing tab is missing, follow these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that you're using a self-hosted IR. If you're using a linked IR, these do not have a **Sharing tab**. 
2. Determine whether you're using a different mode than usual. For example, if you prevously used live mode, but now you're using Git mode (which is effectively a linked IR), you won't have a Sharing tab.

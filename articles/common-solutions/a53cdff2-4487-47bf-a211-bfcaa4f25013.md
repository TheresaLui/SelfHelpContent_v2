# Mapping Data Flow - Performance Issue Common Solutions

**General Performance Recommendations:**
If the source is 

**Azure SQL Source**, we recommend to: 

- Analyze the dataflow for optimized partitioning. Refer to this [Optimized tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance#optimize-tab) for more details.
- If 1==1 is being used in a join condition, we recommend instead that you use column value to compare.
- Debug clusters are intended to preview small data. Increase compute size in proportion to the payload being submitted.

**Azure Synapse Analytics sources**, we recommend to:

-  Use Enable Staging instead of partitioning that improves read performance.

**File-based sources**, we recommend to:

- Use the Spark-native Parquet format for optimal read and write times.
- [File-based Source Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance#file-based-sources)


**Recommended Partitions:**
Based on sources, we recommend the following partitionings:
- SQL Source -> source partitioning
- File Base Source/Sink -> default partitioning is best
- In intermediate transformations, avoid any explicit partitions other than source and sink.

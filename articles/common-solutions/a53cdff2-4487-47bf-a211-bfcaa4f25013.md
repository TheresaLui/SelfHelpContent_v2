# Mapping Data Flow - Performance Issue Common Solutions

## General Performance Recommendations

Resolve most performance issues by following these recommendations.  

### Azure SQL Source recommendations

- Analyze the dataflow for optimized partitioning. Refer to this [Optimized tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance#optimize-tab) for more details.
- If 1==1 is being used in a join condition, we recommend instead that you use `column value` to compare.
- Debug clusters are intended to preview small data. Increase compute size in proportion to the payload being submitted.

### Azure Synapse Analytics recommendations

-  Use **Enable Staging** instead of partitioning to improve read performance
- [Azure Synapse Analytics Source Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance#azure-synapse-analytics-sources)

### File-based source recommendations

- Use the Spark-native Parquet format for optimal read and write times.
- [File-based Source Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance#file-based-sources)


### Recommended Partitions
Based on sources, we recommend the following partitionings:
- For SQL Source, use source partitioning
- For File Base Source/Sink, the default partitioning is best
- In intermediate transformations, avoid any explicit partitions other than source and sink.

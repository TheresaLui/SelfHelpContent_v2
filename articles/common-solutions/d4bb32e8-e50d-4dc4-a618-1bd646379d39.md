# Bot and Speech Telephony Channel Issues

Most users are able to resolve their Telephony channel issues using the steps below

## **Recommended Steps**

1. When creating a Speech Resource, ideally this should be in the same region as your Bot's Azure region for best latencies. 
2. Please note that currently Telephony Channel is only supported in West US 2 and East US Azure regions. Please create your Cognitive Services Speech Resource in one of those regions.

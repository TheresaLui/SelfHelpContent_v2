# Creating, Editing and Deleting VWAN Hub

If you have trouble deleting the VirtualWAN Hubs, try the following steps.

1. Make sure that you delete all of the connections and propagation on both the default and none route tables. This includes VNET connections and any sites associated to the HUB.

2. Make sure that no static routes exist in both the default and none route tables.

3. Reset the Virtual Hub from the Azure portal.

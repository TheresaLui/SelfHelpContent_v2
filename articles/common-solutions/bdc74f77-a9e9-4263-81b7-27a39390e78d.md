Most users are able to resolve issues with scanning by using the steps below..

## **Recommended Steps**

Currently, there are some limitations on scanning a source depending on your network security and infrastructure. The Purview product team is working on high priority to enable these scenarios

1. Purview is not able to scan a source that is behind a firewall
2. Purview is not able to read secrets from a Key Vault that is behind a firewall
3. For Power BI, MSI authentication is the only supported type
4. Power BI users are not allowed to register multiple scans for the same data source.

The firewall issues would be resolved once Purview is onboarded as a 'Trusted Service' with partner Azure Services like Key Vault. We are also working on enabling the Power BI use cases in the future.

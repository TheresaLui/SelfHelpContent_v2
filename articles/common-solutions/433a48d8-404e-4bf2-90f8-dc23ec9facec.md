Most users are able to resolve issues with sensitivity labels by using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

The report shows new classifications found in the last X days, based on the time filter. There are few possibilities: 
1.  No new scans were run in the last X days 
2.  No new classifications were found in the last X days, despite the scans being scheduled and run as configured  
3.  The files were not scanned because they are not supported 
4.  The files were scanned but donâ€™t have labeled content 

If no new labels were found, the graph will be empty. 
Change the time filter to see all the data for that time window.

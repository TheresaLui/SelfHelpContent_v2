# Buying Azure Artifacts

Resolve common issues around Artifacts billing with the following solutions.

## **Recommended Steps**

* I am unable to upload additional packages and get the error: "Artifact cannot be uploaded because max quantity has been exceeded or the payment instrument is invalid"

  - Go to the **Billing** section under **Organization Settings** and make sure that your tier is set to **No limit, pay as you go**. After you make this change, the new setting can take approximately 1 hour to take effect.

* I used to be on usage tiers, but now I'm not.

  - See [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-artifacts-billing-changes-coming-october-2020/) for changes to Artifacts billing

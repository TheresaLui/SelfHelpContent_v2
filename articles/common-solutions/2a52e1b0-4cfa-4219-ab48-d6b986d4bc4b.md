# Point to site VPN connectivity issues

Point-to-Site connections are useful when you want to connect to your virtual network from a remote location, such as when you are telecommuting from home or a conference. Point-to-Site connectivity issues may be due to not having proper VPN profiles on the clients or some other common causes. You can use below help to resolve common Point-to-Site connectivity issues.
 
## **Recommended Steps**

If you are having problems connecting to your VPN from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, you may need to enable support for TLS 1.2. Please see [Point-to-Site FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vpn-faq#P2S) for additional details.

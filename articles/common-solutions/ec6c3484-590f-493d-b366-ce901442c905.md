# Cloud-to-device messages failing or timing out

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure the device isn't accidentally disabled in [IoT Devices tab](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.DeviceExplorerBlade.id.$resourceId)
2. See if running connection diagnostics on the device shows any issues: [IoT Hub connection diagnostics tool](https://github.com/Azure/iothub-diagnostics)
3. If you have [logs turned on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitor-resource-health#cloud-to-device-commands), check for common issues under the category C2DCommands:

- **MessageExpired**: The C2D message expired because the device hasn't processed the message in time. Typically this is because device was offline. To resolve, see [C2D message time to live](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d#message-expiration-time-to-live).

- **DeliveryCountExceeded**: Message was abandoned or the lock timed out (transition between the Enqueued and Invisible states) too many times, exceeding the configured `maxDeliveryCount` value. Find the device ID and delivery count values (properties column) and consider [changing the maxDeliveryCount configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d#cloud-to-device-configuration-options).

- [404001 DeviceNotFound](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-404103-devicenotonline)

- [403004 DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-403006-devicemaximumactivefileuploadlimitexceeded)

- [412002 DeviceMessageLockLost](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-412002-devicemessagelocklost)

- [500xxx Internal errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-500xxx-internal-errors)

4. Make sure to collect logs so we can better help you diagnose the issue.

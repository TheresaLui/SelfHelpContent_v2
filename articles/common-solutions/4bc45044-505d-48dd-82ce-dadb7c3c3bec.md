# Azure Sentinel - Threat Hunting ,Watchlist and Notebooks - Using bookmarks operations

## **Recommended Steps**

1. I want to add multiple bookmarks to an incident but when I try to add them they are not reflecting in the incident 
and they are not showing the incident information in the bookmark list: <br>
	Only 20 bookmarks can be associated with a given incident.
	
2. I tried to create a bookmark by selecting multiple events but it creates a bookmark for each one: <br>
Currently bookmarks record the originating query and one selected result of that query.

3. I created a bookmark but the investigation button is greyed out on the bookmarks page/incident page: <br>
In order to view bookmarks on the investigation graph, entity types user and/or host must be mapped in the bookmark creation experience. <br>
There is no way to add entity mapping afterward. However you can re-run the originating query and re-create the bookmark with the entity mappings by following these steps:<br>
	1. Select the bookmark you want to change by selecting the checkbox at the left of the row
	2. On the right-side pane, select **View source query** to be taken to the Log Analytics experience
	3. Run the query (or edit and run it) and identify the result you want to bookmark
	4. Select **Add bookmark** and follow the steps outlined above in **Adding a Bookmark** to create it

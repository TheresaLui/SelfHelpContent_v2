# After cancelling a job it continues to run

You may request to cancel a job after having submitted it, however job cancellations are not guaranteed.

Job cancellations should instead be treated as 'cancellation requests'. Additionally the behavior might differ based on the provider you are using.

## **Recommended Steps** 

1. Please review our provider [documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/wiki/Azure-Quantum-provider) to establish whether your chosen provider supports cancellation requests
2. If your provider supports cancellation, retry your request as it can take several seconds or even minutes (depending on the provider) for the cancellation request to complete
3. If your issues persists, please record the time of your cancellation requests and raise a support case. A member of the team will help you troubleshoot further.

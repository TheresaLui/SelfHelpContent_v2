# My site has been added to the block list

Customers running in the public or multi-tenant environment all share the same group of outbound IP addresses.  It is possible that there is a problematical element in the tenant that's causing the IPs to be blocked.

You can search for blocked IPs at [CBL](https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/), after confirming that you are not a robot.

If this is a major concern, an ASE affords you your own inbound and outbound IP. Private Endpoints will also provide this capability.

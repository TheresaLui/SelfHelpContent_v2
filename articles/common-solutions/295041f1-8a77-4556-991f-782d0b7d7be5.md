# Single sign-in configuration (Gallery+"Bring your own apps")

Most users are able to resolve their Single sign-in configuration issues using the steps below:

**Recommended Steps**

**Need to troubleshoot errors while signing in to SAML based single sign-on (SSO) configured apps (Reply URL, Identifier value, misconfigured applications, AuthN issues, HTTP Redirect binding)?**
To troubleshoot the sign-in issues, we recommend referring to [Troubleshooting guide for problems signing in to SAML based single sign on configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-sign-in-problem-federated-sso-gallery?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Apps_Sign_In_Support_L2_Gallery). For more information on AADSTS error codes returned from Azure AD security token service (STS), please read [Azure AD Authentication and Authorization Error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 
To solve problems while configuring an application for SAML based SSO, check out [Troubleshoot SAML based single sign-on in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/troubleshoot-saml-based-sso?WT.mc_id=UI_AAD_Enterprise_Apps_Support_L2_Overview). For information on implementing HTTP Redirect binding (for application to send SAML request encoded in the location header), please refer [SAML protocol specification document](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-bindings-2.0-os.pdf).
To understand SAML 2.0 authentication requests and responses that Azure AD supports for Single Sign-On, refer to the article [Single Sign-On SAML protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol#conditionsForceAuthnThe%20%22maxTimeSinceAuthn%22).

**Have questions on configuring Group claims or customizing claims issued in SAML token?**
Azure AD can provide users group membership information in tokens, supporting following 2 attributes-
* Azure Active Directory object identifier (OID) attribute
* sAMAccountName or GroupSID attributes for Active Directory synchronized groups and users  
Group membership claims can be emitted in tokens for any group if you use the ObjectId format. To use group claims in other formats, the groups must be synchronized from Active Directory using Azure AD Connect.To know more, refer [Configure group claims for applications with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims).
You can [Customize claims issued in SAML token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization) through Azure portal if the application requires the NameIdentifier or NameID claim to be something other than the username (or user principal name) stored in Azure AD or the application has been written to require a different set of claim URIs or claim values. You can also [Customize claims through Graph/PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-claims-mapping#table-2-saml-restricted-claim-set).

**Common questions about certificates for federated SSO in Azure AD**
On adding new application from the gallery and configuring SAML-based sign-on, Azure AD generates a certificate for the application that is valid for three years. [Create, renew/update certificates for SAML SSO configured apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on).  For information on certificate signing options and algorithms, please refer [Advanced certificate signing options in the SAML token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/certificate-signing-options).

**Recommended Documents**

* Integrate SaaS applications with Azure AD by referring [Application Tutorial for Single Sign-on and User provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list) and [Configure SAML based single sign on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-saml-single-sign-on) for your applications
* Solve common SAML SSO problems by referring [Redirect URI (Reply URL) restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url)
* Ask questions to developer community at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/saml-2.0)

# Single Sign-in configuration (Gallery + "bring your own apps")

## **Recommended Steps**

Resolve most single sign-on (SSO) issues by using the following information.

**I have an issue signing in to SAML-based, SSO-configured apps, and getting errors related to Reply URL, Identifier value, misconfigured applications, AuthN, and HTTP redirect binding**

* [Debug SAML-based SSO issues through SSO Testing experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/debug-saml-sso-issues)
* [Error AADSTS50011 - The reply URL specified in the request doesn't match the reply URLs configured for the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch)
* [Error AADSTS650056 - Misconfigured application](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts650056-misconfigured-app)
* [Error AADSTS70001 - Application with Identifier was not found in the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts70001-app-not-found-in-directory)

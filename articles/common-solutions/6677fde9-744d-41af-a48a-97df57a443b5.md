# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Can I create my own attributes in Azure AD B2C ?** 

Your Azure AD B2C directory comes with a [built-in set of attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-profile-attributes). However, if you need to create your own attributes to manage a specific scenario, then you can [define custom attributes in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-custom-attributes?pivots=b2c-custom-policy).

# Permissions to perform operations on Managed HSM

An application does not have sufficient permissions to perform operations on Managed HSM.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure you have the service principal id of your application. The CLI command below can show the information about your application's service principal id.

    ```
    az ad sp show --id [your application id] --query "{servicePrincipalId: objectId}" -o table
    ```

2. Show the current permissions of your application service principal in CLI:
    ```
    az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name [PoolName] --assignee-object-id [service principal id]
    ```

    Make sure a role assignment is in the output. If there is no result, it means there is no role assigned to your application, please follow step 3. 
  
    If there is already a role assigned, make sure the role have the permission to carry out the operation intended. Run this CLI command to check each role's permissions.
    
    ```
    az keyvault role definition list --hsm-name [PoolName]
    ```

3. Ask an administrator ( a user in Managed HSM builtin roles "Managed HSM Administrator" ) of Managed HSM to assign a appropriate role to service principal retrieved above.
 
    When using Azure CLI, run this command as the administrator of the Managed HSM:<br>
    - To give key encrypt/decrypt operations to the application:

      ```
      az keyvault role assignment create --assignee "[service principal id]" --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --scope "/" --hsm-name [PoolName]
      ```

    - To give key additional key create/delete operations to the application: 

      ```
      az keyvault role assignment create --assignee "[service principal id]" --role "Managed HSM Crypto Officer" --scope "/" --hsm-name [PoolName]
      ```

    Role **Managed HSM Administrator** has all the permissions.

    - To list all the administorators of this Managed HSM, run Azure CLI command:

      ```
      az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name [PoolName] --role "Managed HSM Administrator"
      ```

See the following links for details of the built-in permissions for different roles in Managed HSM.

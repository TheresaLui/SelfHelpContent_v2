# IoT PNP Notifications Self Help

When digital twin change events are enabled, an event is triggered whenever the current or desired value of the component or property changes. 

For example, the following digital twin change event is triggered when *targetTemperature* is set by the solution:

```
iothub-connection-device-id:sample-device
iothub-enqueuedtime:7/17/2020 6:11:04 AM
iothub-message-source:digitalTwinChangeEvents
correlation-id:275d463fa034
content-type:application/json-patch+json
content-encoding:utf-8
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/$metadata/targetTemperature",
    "value": {
      "desiredValue": 21.8,
      "desiredVersion": 4
    }
  }
]
```

The following digital twin change event is triggered when the device reports that the above change was applied:

```
iothub-connection-device-id:sample-device
iothub-enqueuedtime:7/17/2020 6:11:05 AM
iothub-message-source:digitalTwinChangeEvents
correlation-id:275d464a2c80
content-type:application/json-patch+json
content-encoding:utf-8
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/$metadata/targetTemperature/ackCode",
    "value": 200
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/$metadata/targetTemperature/ackDescription",
    "value": "Successfully executed patch"
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/$metadata/targetTemperature/ackVersion",
    "value": 4
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/$metadata/targetTemperature/lastUpdateTime",
    "value": "2020-07-17T06:11:04.9309159Z"
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/thermostat1/targetTemperature",
    "value": 21.8
  }
]
```

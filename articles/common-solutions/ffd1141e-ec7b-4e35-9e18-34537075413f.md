# Ranker Process and Confidence Score

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

* **Why is there an inconsistency between the score of my test index and prod/published index?**
 This is by design, because in the test environment, the score is impacted by other KBs in the given Azure Search resource. However, for production, scores are dependent only on the selected KB. This is due to the use of Azure Search indexes.

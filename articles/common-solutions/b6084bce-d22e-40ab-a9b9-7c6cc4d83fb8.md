# Speech Service Containers

Containers enable you to run some of the Speech service APIs in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements. 
In this article you'll learn how to download, install, and run a Speech container. 

Speech containers enable customers to build a speech application architecture that is optimized for both robust cloud capabilities and edge locality. There are four different containers available. The two standard containers are Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech. The two custom containers are Custom Speech-to-text and Custom Text-to-speech. Speech containers have the same pricing as the cloud-based Azure Speech Services.

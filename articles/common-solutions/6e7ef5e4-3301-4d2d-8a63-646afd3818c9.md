# Device Reset

To reset your device, you need to securely wipe all the data from the data disk and also from the boot disk of your device.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you use the device reset in the local web UI, only the data disks are securely wiped, and the boot disk is kept intact. The boot disk contains the device configuration.
2. Connect to the PowerShell interface
3. At the command prompt, type: `Reset-HcsAppliance -ClearData -BootDisk`
4. To create a new ASE Resource after resetting ASE device, you'll need to disconnect and reconnect for IOT Hub

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Reset device instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-connect-powershell-interface#view-device-information)

### Notes
* If the preceding steps don't help, create a new ASE Resource after resetting ASE device. Then enable disconnect and reconnect for IOT Hub.
* The BootDisk switch wipes the boot disk and makes the device unusable. It should be used only when the device needs to be returned to Microsoft.

# Maintenance event outside of maintenance window

You noticed connectivity glitch or unavailability signal outside of the maintenance window? 
It may happen due to: hardware failure, [instance management operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/management-operations-overview#instance-availability), [user-initiated failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/user-initiated-failover) or, in very rare circumstances, due to urgent security patching that couldn't be postponed until the next maintenance window.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check the [Resource Health history](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-health-to-troubleshoot-connectivity) of your database for more details

# Maintenance event outside of maintenance window

Did you notice a connectivity glitch or unavailability signal outside of the maintenance window? <br>
This may happen because of:<br> 

* Hardware failure (unplanned failover)

* [Instance management operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/management-operations-overview#instance-availability)

* [User-initiated failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/user-initiated-failover)

* In very rare circumstances, this occurs because of an urgent security patch that couldn't be postponed until the next maintenance window.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check the [Resource Health history](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/resource-health-to-troubleshoot-connectivity) of your database for more details

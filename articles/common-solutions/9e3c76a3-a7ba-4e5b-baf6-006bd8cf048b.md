# Azure Sentinel - Automation and Playbooks - Playbooks not triggering as expected

## **Recommended Steps**

Azure Sentinel has two Logic Apps triggers:
1.	Trigger on Alert creation ("When an Azure Sentinel Alert was triggered")
	Have you attached this playbook to an Analytic rule?

	1. Go to Analytics and find the analytic rule that triggers this playbook. In the Automated response tab, select this playbook to run when this rule generates an alert.
	2. If it is selected, but not running, try to re-attach the playbook to the rule:
		1. In the Automated response blade, unselect the playbook. Save the analytic rule. Select the playbook again and save the analytic rule.<br>
	**Note:** Only Scheduled query rules allow setting automated response for alert creation. For other rules, such as Microsoft providers, use incident trigger and Automation rules.

	The playbook runs, but logic doesnt happen as expected.
	1.	Make sure the logic actually didn't run: On the playbook main page (Logic Apps resource blade), select the **Refresh** button to check the run history and see if there's a recent run. It's possible that the playbook was run, but due to a logic failure, you didn’t get the expected results.

2. 	Trigger on Incident creation ("When an Azure Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered")<br>
	**Note:** This feature is in Private preview.
	
	Have you attached this playbook to an Automation rule?
	1. In the Azure Sentinel menu, select **Automation**, and create or edit the automation rule that will trigger this playbook. Make sure to attach the playbook to this rule.

	The playbook may have run, but the logic didn't behave as expected.
	1. On the playbook main page (Logic Apps resource blade), select the **Refresh** button to check the run history to see if there was a recent run. It's possible that the playbook was run, but due to a logic failure, you didn’t get the expected results.

	Were all the conditions held?
	1. The playbook might not have beene triggered due to a failure of holding the selected conditions. Try removing the conditions in order to see which condition is not properly set.

	Are there any automation rules with a lower order than this one?
	1. It's possible that earlier automation rules influenced the incident before it arrived to this automation rule, causing one or more of the conditions not to be held.<br> **Note:** Due to time delays, playbooks have a two-minute delay between executions.

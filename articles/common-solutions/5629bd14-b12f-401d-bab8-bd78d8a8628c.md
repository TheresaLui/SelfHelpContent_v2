# How to get logs for Azure IoT Edge

In Linux, the Azure IoT Edge runtime uses system logging for IoT Edge security manager service (`iotedged`). 
In Windows, the Azure IoT Edge runtime uses Windows Event Logging for the service.

The runtime uses container logs for the containerized components (edgeAgent, edgeHub, and modules). 
Starting with version 1.0.10, you can access these logs remotely.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Getting comprehensive logs - Support bundles 
Support bundles are a full set of logs, including system and container logs.  
- [Get the support bundle uploaded to storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-retrieve-iot-edge-logs#upload-support-bundle-diagnostics) 
- [Get the support bundle with a direct connection to the device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#gather-debug-information-with-support-bundle-command) 

### Getting logs remotely 
In 1.0.10 and later, you can retrieve logs remotely by direct methods to the edgeAgent module. 
You can acquire logs by the `GetModuleLogs` direct method or by uploading them to blob storage by the `UploadModuleLogs` 
direct method.
- Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-retrieve-iot-edge-logs) to get logs via direct method

### Getting logs on the device
- _1.1 (and earlier)_ [Acquire IoT Edge system logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot?view=iotedge-2018-06#check-the-status-of-the-iot-edge-security-manager-and-its-logs)
- _1.2 (and later)_ [Acquire IoT Edge system logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot?view=iotedge-2020-11#check-the-status-of-the-iot-edge-security-manager-and-its-logs)

Logs for containers may be obtained two ways, by either the `iotedge logs` command or the `docker logs` command: 

``` 
# find the container name with "list" 
iotedge list  
iotedge logs <container name> 

# or 
docker ps –a 
docker logs <container name> 
``` 

### Getting logs from IoT Edge on Kubernetes 
IoT Edge on Kubernetes is logging to the cluster's logging system.  The most common command is `kubectl logs`: 

``` 
kubectl get pods –n <edge namespace>  
kubectl logs –n <edge namespace> <podname> -c <modulename> 
``` 
For more information, see [IoT Edge on Kubernetes documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/iotedge-k8s-doc/)

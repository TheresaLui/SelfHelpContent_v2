# Hardware Issues.

All device events related to hardware health on your Azure Stack Edge device (for example, a failed Power Supply Unit (PSU) or a change in device password) result in alerts of different severity in the Azure portal. To monitor the hardware health status through the Azure portal, create action rules that notify you via email/SMS/webhook of any device alerts that are fired. 
In case healthmonitor as described below is failing, make sure that the VM size allocated is a minimum of 16GB. 

Take the following steps in the local web UI to view the hardware status of your device components.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Connect to the local web UI of your device: Go to **Maintenance** > **Hardware status**. 
2.  In the local web UI, go to **Troubleshooting** > **Diagnostic tests**, select the test you want to run, and select **Run test**.   
    This runs tests to diagnose issues with your network, device, web proxy, time, or cloud settings. You will be notified when the device runs tests. After the tests have completed, the results are displayed.

3.  If a test fails, or shows a warning for the Network Interface card, select the provided URL to view the recommended action.

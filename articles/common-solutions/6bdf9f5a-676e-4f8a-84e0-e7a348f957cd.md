# Azure Sentinel - Threat Hunting ,Watchlist and Notebooks - Hunting or livestream query operations"

Resolve common hunting or livestream query operations using the following steps.


## **Recommended Steps**

* I clicked the **Run All Queries** option on the page but only the first page of queries were run. <br>
    This option only runs the queries on the current page. To run additional queries, select **Next** on the pagination controls at the bottom of the table and select **Run all Queries** again.

* I want to have queries run on page load. <br>
    To run a query or group of queries run automatically on page load, you can add them to favorites.<br> 
    * To do this, select the star next to the query. This will also sort the query to the top of the list. <br>
      Up to 25 queries will be shown on each page of the query table. <br>
    * Use the pagination tools at the bottom of the table to continue to additional queries if you have more than 25 favorites.

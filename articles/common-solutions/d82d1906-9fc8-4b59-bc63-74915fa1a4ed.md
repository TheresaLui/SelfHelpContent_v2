# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Need help investigating an incident

Use the following steps to investigate incidents.

Learn about [working with Analytic rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom). 
	2. If the issue with an analytic rule template provided by Microsoft, please go to our GitHub repository to check that you are using the latest version of the template or leave a comment directly on GitHub to our research team.

	1. To investigate the threat you can review to following documentation on [investigating incidents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-investigate-cases) and on [responding to threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-respond-threats-playbook).

# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Need help investigating an incident

Use the following steps to investigate incidents.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In case of a possible false positive incident:
	1. Consider modifying the analytic rule to exclude similar false positive incidents in the future. You can find a link to the analytic rule that generated the incident on the incident page. Learn about [working with Analytic rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom). 
	2. If the issue concerned an analytic rule template provided by Microsoft, go to our GitHub repository to make sure that you're using the latest version of the template, or to leave a comment on GitHub for our research team.

2. In case of a possible true positive incident:
	1. Investigate the threat by reviewing documentation on [investigating incidents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-investigate-cases) and [responding to threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-respond-threats-playbook).

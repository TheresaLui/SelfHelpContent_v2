# I'm facing issues with the web proxy settings

Most users are able to resolve their issues with web proxy settings by using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

- In the Web proxy URL box, enter the URL in this format: `http://&lt;host-IP address` or `FQDN&gt;:Port number`. HTTPS URLs are not supported.
- Under Authentication, select **None** or **NTLM**
- If you're using authentication, enter a username and password
- To validate and apply the configured web proxy settings, select **Apply**

## **Recommended Documents**

- [Tutorial: Connect, set up, activate Azure Data Box Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-deploy-connect-setup-activate)

## Notes

- Proxy-auto config (PAC) files are not supported
- A PAC file defines how web browsers and other user agents can automatically choose the appropriate proxy server (access method) for fetching a given URL 
- Proxies that try to intercept and read all the traffic (and then re-sign everything with their own certification) aren't compatible because the proxy's cerification is not trusted. Typically, transparent proxies work well with Azure Data Box Gateway.

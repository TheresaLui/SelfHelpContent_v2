# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Using the cross workspace incidents view

## **Recommended Steps**

In order to view incidents from multiple workspaces, navigate to Sentinel from the main Azure portal. 
In the workspace selector screen, you can use the checkboxes to select the workspace you want to see incident from and click Multiple Workspace View. 
To learn more about working with incidents across multiple workspace, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/multiple-workspace-view).

1. Up to 10 workspace can be selected at once. IF more than 10 are a requirement, please submit a feature request using [Azure Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/920458-azure-sentinel).

2. To work with incidents across multiple tenants at once, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants) to learn how to accomplish this using Azure Lighthouse.

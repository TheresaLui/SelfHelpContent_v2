# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Using the cross workspace incidents view

Learn about using the cross workspace incidents view from the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To view incidents from multiple workspaces, from the main Azure portal, navigate to **Sentinel**
1. In the workspace selector screen, use the checkboxes to select the workspace from which you want to see an incident, and select **Multiple Workspace View**
1. You can select up to 10 workspaces at a time. If you need to select more than 10, submit a feature request using [Azure Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/920458-azure-sentinel).
1. To work with incidents across multiple tenants at the same time, review instructions on [how to accomplish this in Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants)

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Working with incidents in many workspaces at once](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/multiple-workspace-view)
* [Extend Azure Sentinel across workspaces and tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants)

# Modules or downstream devices are not receiving direct methods

IoT Edge can forward direct methods to a module or downstream device.  This is a best effort attempt to make the call with a maximum 5 minute timeout.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Confirm module or device name is the same as module addressed in method call. Names are case sensitive. 
2. Please ensure the method request has a sufficiently long timeout.  IoT Edge processing of a direct method will add a small (typically <1 second) amount of time to the method call. 
3. Update to latest IoT Edge Runtime, See [how to upgrade the IoT Edge runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-update-iot-edge). 
4. Turn on debug logs for the IoT Edge hub to see if you're getting method call confirmations for each module. For more information, see [View the messages going through the IoT Edge hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#view-the-messages-going-through-the-iot-edge-hub). 
5. Check the module or device logs to ensure it is connected to IoT Edge. This may be a good time to [get a support bundle](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot#gather-debug-information-with-support-bundle-command).

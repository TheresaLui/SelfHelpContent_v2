#  Reset redemption invitation sends to the correct email address

A common issue with reset redemption is that the admin is not able to reset to the correct email address.  The admin needs to ensure that the email address is either the one that they were initially invited with, or is in the `otherMails` property of the user.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check whether the email address being used is the same as the one they were originally invited with. If this is the same email address, then resetting the invitation status should work.
2. If the email addresses are different, you need to add the email address to the [user.otherMails property](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties).

# NFS Share

On your Linux client connected to your Azure Stack Edge device, complete the following procedure.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure that the client has NFSv4 client installed. To install the NFS client, use the following command:<br>
   `sudo apt-get install nfs-common`<br>

   For more information, go to [Install NFSv4 Client](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo#NFSv4_client).

2. After the NFS client is installed, mount the NFS share that you created on your Azure Stack Edge device using the following command:<br>
   `sudo mount -t nfs -o sec=sys,resvport <device IP>:/<NFS shares on device> /home/username/<Folder on local Linux computer>`<br>
 
   After a file is created in the share, renaming of the file isn't supported.

    **Note:** Deleting a file from a share does not delete the entry in the Azure Storage account.

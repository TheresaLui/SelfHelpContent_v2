# Log Analytics agent health self help guide  

## **Recommended Steps**

### Why is the Log Analytics Agent Not Responding or Not Reporting? 

Windows or Linux IaaS VMs qualify for automatic provisioning of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent installation if: 

- The Log Analytics agent extension is not currently installed on the VM 
- The VM is in running state 
- The Windows or Linux Azure Virtual Machine Agent is installed 
- The VM is not used as an appliance such as web application firewall or next generation firewall 
- the VM can communicate over the internet 

To check if the agent (direct\MMA\SCOM) is reporting correctly, you can check the agent heartbeat. 

### Query to check the Heartbeat of the VM

1. Validate that the VM is running 
2. Open Log Analytics portal
3. Select the workspace that the VM connected to
4. Press on the "logs" in the left menu, and write this query: 
   
   ```
   Heartbeat 
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d) 
   | where Computer contains "MyVMName" 
   ``` 
   
In this example, replace the "MyVMName" to your VM name. 

If you are not getting any results, it means that the agent is not able to communicate and send data to the workspace. For more information, refer the following articles:

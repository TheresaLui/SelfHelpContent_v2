# I can't create Alert rules

SQL insights stores it's monitoring data in a Log Analytics workspace.  You will need the proper access to this workspace to create alert rules on the data.


## **Recommended Steps**

1. When creating SQL insights alert rules you need the [Log Analytics contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) on the workspace you will use.
2. If you have the [Log Analytics reader role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) on the workspace, you will only have read access to the data and will not be able to create Alert rules.

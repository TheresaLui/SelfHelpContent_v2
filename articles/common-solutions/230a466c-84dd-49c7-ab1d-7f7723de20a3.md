# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Viewing and handling incidents

Incidents are presented in the **Incidents** tab. Incidents can be filtered, sorted, or searched using actions on the incidents page. 
From each incident, you can navigate to the incident page where you can see the alerts, bookmarks, and entities associated with the incident.  


## **Recommended Steps**

**Cannot find an incident**
1. If you canâ€™t find an incident you expected to see in the incidents table, check the time filters at the top of the page to make sure you are looking in the correct timeframe and that no other filters are applied.  
2. If the incident is indeed missing, make sure that you have an enabled analytic rule that should have detected this incident. 
Learn more about [analytic rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom).
3. If the analytic rules should have created an incident and did not, this could be an issue with the data source. 
To monitor the health of your data connectors, use the data connectors health workbook. 
Learn more anout [data connector health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/monitor-data-connector-health).

**Incident is missing important information**
1. If the incident is missing entities, check if the analytic rule contains the required entity mapping configurations and if the fields are mapped correctly to the entities you wish to see. Learn more about [entity mapping and entities in Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics#entities-in-azure-sentinel).
		
**Can't navigate to the events that generated the alerts in the incident**
1. Go to the event that generated an incident by selecting the **Events** icon on the incident page.
   **Note:** for incidents that are not the product of an scheduled analytic rules, viewing events is not currently supported. The events icon will show N/A.


If you wish to see other details on the incident page that are not currently supported, submit a feature request using [Azure Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/920458-azure-sentinel).

# Azure Sentinel - Incidents and investigation  - Viewing and handling incidents

## **Recommended Steps**

Incidents are presented in the incidents tab. Incidents can be filtered, sorted, or searched using the actions in the incidents page. 
From each incident you can navigate to the incident page where you can see the alerts, bookmarks and entities associated with the incident.  

1. Cannot find an incident:
	1. If you can’t find an incident you expected to see in the incidents table, 
	check the time filters at the top of the page to make sure you are looking in the correct timeframe 
	and that no other filters are applied.  
	2. If the incident is indeed missing, make sure you have an enabled analytic rule that should have detected this incident. 
	To learn more about analytic rules, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom).
	3. If the analytic rules should have created an incident and did not, this could be an issue with the data source. 
	To monitor the health of you data connectors you can use the data connectors health workbook. 
	To learn more click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/monitor-data-connector-health).

2. Incident is missing important information:
	1. If the incident is missing entities:
		1. You can check if the analytic rule contains the required entity mapping configurations 
		and if the fields are mapped correctly to the entities you wish to see. 
	   To learn more about entity mapping  and entities in Sentinel click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics#entities-in-azure-sentinel).
		
3. If you can’t navigate to the events that generated the alerts in the incident:
	1. To reach the events that generated an incident, click the 'Events' icon on the incident page.
	2. Notice, for incidents that are not the product of an scheduled analytic rules, viewing events is not currently supported. 
	The events icon will show N/A.

4. If you wish to see other details on the incident page that are not currently supported, please submit a feature request using [Azure Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/920458-azure-sentinel).

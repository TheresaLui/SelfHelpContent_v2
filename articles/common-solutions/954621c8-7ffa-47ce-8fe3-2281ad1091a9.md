# Text Analytics Containers

Containers enable you to run the Text Analytic APIs in your own environment and are great for your specific security and data governance requirements. The Text Analytics containers provide advanced natural language processing over raw text, and include four main functions:

1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Key Phrase Extraction
3. Language Detection
4. Text Analytics for Health

Note: The container for Sentiment Analysis v3 is now Generally Available. The key phrase extraction and language detection containers are available as an ungated public preview. Currently, you will not be billed for Text Analytics for Health container usage.

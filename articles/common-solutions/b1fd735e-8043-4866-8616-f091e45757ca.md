# Need help configuring metrics 

Azure DDoS Protection Standard monitors public IP addresses assigned to resources within a virtual network. If you don't have any resources with public IP addresses in the virtual network, you must first create a resource with a public IP address. You can monitor the public IP address of all resources deployed through Resource Manager (not classic) listed in [Virtual network for Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services#services-that-can-be-deployed-into-a-virtual-network) (including Azure Load Balancers where the backend virtual machines are in the virtual network), except for Azure App Service Environments. 

Telemetry for an attack is provided through Azure Monitor in real time. Note that Telemetry is available only when a public IP address has been under mitigation. 

## **Recommended steps**

1. Under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**. 
2. Select **Scope**. 
3. Select the Subscription that contains the public IP address you want to log.
4. Select **Public IP Address** for **Resource type**, and select the specific public IP address you want to log metrics for, and then select **Apply**. 
5. Select the Aggregation type as **Max**.

# User Management

You can define users as **read-only** or **full privilege**. As the names indicate, the read-only users can only view the share data. The full privilege users can read share data, write to these shares, and modify or delete the share data.

## **Recommended Steps**

Define user permissions when the user is created during share creation.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource and then go to **Overview** > **Users**. Select **Add user** on the command bar.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [User management details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-manage-users)

### Notes

* Modification of share-level permissions is currently not supported
* The following users are reserved by the system and should not be used: Administrator, EdgeUser, EdgeSupport, HcsSetupUser, WDAGUtilityAccount, CLIUSR, DefaultAccount, Guest

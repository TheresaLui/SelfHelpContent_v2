# User Management

Users can be read-only or full privilege. As the names indicate, the read-only users can only view the share data. The full privilege users can read share data, write to these shares, and modify or delete the share data

## **Recommended Steps**

1. The user permissions are first defined when the user is created during share creation
2. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Stack Edge resource and then go to Overview > Users. Select + Add user on the command bar.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [User management details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-manage-users)

### Notes

* Modification of share-level permissions is currently not supported
* These users are reserved by the system and should not be used: Administrator, EdgeUser, EdgeSupport, HcsSetupUser, WDAGUtilityAccount, CLIUSR, DefaultAccount, Guest

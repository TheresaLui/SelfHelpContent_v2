# Setting up restriction rules

## **Recommended Steps**

Follow these guidelines when you're setting up access restrictions rules:
* The name of the rule cannot be more than 32 characters.
* There is a limit of 512 rows of IP or service-endpoint restrictions. If you require more than 512 rows of restrictions, consider installing a standalone security product, such as Azure Front Door, Azure App Gateway, or a WAF.
* If IPV6 addresses are getting restricted, it indicates that requests are coming over service endpoint. For these scenarios, allow traffic for the respective subnet.


## **Recommended Documents**

* [Static IP restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions)
* [Dynamic IP restrictions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure/dynamic-ip-restriction-for-app-services/ba-p/1150049)

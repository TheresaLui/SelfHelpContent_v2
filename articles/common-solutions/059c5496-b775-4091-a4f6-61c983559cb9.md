# Private Endpoint and Private DNS allowance request

While Azure Machine Learning creates resources in your (customer) subscription, there are some scenarios that create resources in a Microsoft-owned subscription. In the following scenarios, you need to request a quota allowance in the Microsoft-owned subscription. 

* Private Link enabled workspace with a customer-managed key
* Azure Container Registry for the workspace behind your virtual network
* Attaching a Private Link enabled Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to your workspace

## **Recommended Steps**

Please use this support topic only if you are requesting a quota allowance for the above scenarios. For all other inquiries, please use a different support topic.

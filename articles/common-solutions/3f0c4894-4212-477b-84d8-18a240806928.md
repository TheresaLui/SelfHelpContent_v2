# How to

## **Recommended Steps**

1. First, find the error that is returned while trying to execute the pipeline or when trying to connect to the data set. You can try testing the connection by editing the linked service and selecting **Test connection**. If you're using a self-hosted IR, you can find detailed information in Integration Runtime logs in Windows event logs. To find them, go to **Event Viewer** > **Application and Services Logs** > **Integration Runtime** and **Connectors**. 

2. Review the documented errors and solutions.  The following troubleshooting guides provide many common errors and solutions: 

   - If you get any unexpected connectivity errors from Ativity, see [Activity troubleshooting guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-troubleshoot-guide) 

   - If you get any unexpected connectivity errors from connectors, see [connector troubleshooting guide]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-troubleshoot-guide)

   - If you get any unexpected connectivity errors via Managed VNet and private links, see [security and access control troubleshoot guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/security-and-access-control-troubleshoot-guide) 

   - If you get any unexpected connectivity errors from Self-Hosted IR, see [sel hosted Integration runtime troubleshoot guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/self-hosted-integration-runtime-troubleshoot-guide) 

3. If you are using a self-hosted IR to connect to your data, make sure you test your connectivity from the Self-Hosted IR machine, access the **Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager**, and confirm that it is connected to the cloud service. Then go to the **Diagnostics** tab and test the connection to your data source/sink. You can find detailed information in Integration Runtime logs in Windows event logs. To find them, go to **Event Viewer** > **Application and Services Logs** > **Integration Runtime** and **Connectors**, and then go to step 2. 

4. Make sure that Networking security components such as firewalls, Network Security Groups, and VPN configurations have not changed. If your scenario uses any of these components, review the [data movement security considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-movement-security-considerations#firewall-configurations-and-allow-list-setting-up-for-ip-address-of-gateway) documentation to ensure all configurations are correct.  

4. Make sure that ensure ports are on the allow list for both central _corporate_ firewall and local machine _Windows_ firewall. For more details, see [Firewall Whitelisting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#ports-and-firewalls). 

If your IR uses proxy server, see [Proxy Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#proxy-server-considerations)

5. After reviewing the logs and relevant documentation, if you still need assistance, open a support request. Make sure to mention the specific error you are addressing and attach the logs you gathered while troubleshooting the issue.

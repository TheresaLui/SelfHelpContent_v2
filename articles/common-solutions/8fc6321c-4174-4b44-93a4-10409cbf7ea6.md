# Validations failing at Review+Create

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check to see if you have owner permissions for the subscription that is selected: [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal). 

**Note:** Having Owner permissions at the Resource Group level is not enough.

* Check whether `Confluent organization name` contains a space or tab, or any of the following forbidden characters: <>#%'*^`{|}~\" 
* Check if the Plan and Price information has loaded correctly. We are currently working on issues in these areas.

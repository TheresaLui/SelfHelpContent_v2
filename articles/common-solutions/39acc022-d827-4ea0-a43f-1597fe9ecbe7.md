# Workbook isn't showing any data 

Most customers can resolve issues with missing data in workbooks using these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you have a GPU workbook, you must have a [GPU enabled node-pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-gpu-monitoring)
* If you have an NPM workbook, make sure that [NPM is enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/kubernetes-network-policies?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json#monitor-and-visualize-network-configurations-with-azure-npm)

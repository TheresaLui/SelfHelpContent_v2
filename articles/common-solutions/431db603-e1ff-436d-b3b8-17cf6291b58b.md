# Azure Sentinel - Analytic rules  - Issues with analytics templates

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Make sure there are no parameters in the template that needs to be set.

2.	Make sure that the query in you active rule is identical to the one found on the template.

3.	Validate that you are using our latest template version found in our portal or on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Detections).

4.	Make sure your rule is set according to [analytics rules documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in)

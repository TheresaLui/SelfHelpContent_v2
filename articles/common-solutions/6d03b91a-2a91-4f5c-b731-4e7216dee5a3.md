# Azure Sentinel - Data collection - Connectors to Microsoft products 

The Microsoft products data connectors are based on Service-to-Service integrations, which can be enabled by the UI or the API. Learn more about data connectors by reviewing the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure to follow the prerequisites and configuration steps described in the relevant connector page. 

2. For Azure based connector, Azure Sentinel runs on top of a Log Analytics workspace. Therefore, only data that is available in your workspace will also be available in Azure Sentinel.

3. The Office 365 integration is based on a native integration with the Office management API. This connector allows you to ingest SharePoint, Exchange, and Teams audit logs.<br>
   See the following issues:<br>
   * [Office 365 solution retirement in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solution-office-365)
   * [Access data through the Office 365 Management Activity API using connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365)
   * Multi-tenant scenarios: The Office 365 native connector in Azure Sentinel allows single tenant integration only. To collect data from a multi-tenant environment, use a [custom logs integration solution based on the Office Management API](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data).
   * Connecting unsupported Office workloads via the Office Management API. If the Azure Sentinel Office 365 data connector doesn't include your desired source, but this source/workload is available in the [Office Management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema), use the [Office custom log solution provided in Azure Sentinel GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data).

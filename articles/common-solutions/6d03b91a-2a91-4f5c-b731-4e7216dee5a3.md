# Azure Sentinel - Data collection - Connectors to Microsoft products 

## **Recommended Steps**

The Microsoft products data connectors are based on Service to Service integrations that can be enabled by the UI or the API.

1. Make sure you followed the prerequisites and configuration steps described in the relevant connector page. 

2. For Azure based connectors - Azure sentinel runs on top of a Log Analytics workspace. Therefore, only data that is available in your workspace will also be available in Azure Sentinel.

3. The office 365 integration is based on a native integration with the Office management API. This connector allows you to ingest SharePoint, Exchange and Teams audit logs.
	Common issues:
		○ [Office365 solution retirement in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solution-office-365)
		○ In order for the connector to be able to access data through the Office 365 Management Activity API, please follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365)
		○ Multi-tenant scenarios - the Office 365 native connector in Azure Sentinel allows single tenant integration only. In order to collect data from a multi-tenant environment, we suggest to use a custom logs integration solution based on the Office Management API. See the following [suggested solution](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data).
		○ Connect unsupported Office workloads via the Office Management API - in case that the Azure Sentinel Office365 data connector does not include your desired source (and this source/workload is available in the [Office Management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema)) we suggest to use the [Office custom log solution provided in Azure Sentinel GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data).

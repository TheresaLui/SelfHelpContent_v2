# Load testing a Bot

To perform load testing on a bot, you'll need to understand:
- How to authenticate messages to and from your bot 
- How to create and parse those messages

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Create an access token to authenticate with the Bot Service
To do this, send an HTTP POST. A successful request will contain a JSON payload that contains the access token.
2. Create a mock channel/message sink
To test your bot, create a custom UI/message sink to send and receive messages to your bot. This message sink will act like a channel and accept HTTP POST messages with JSON-serialized bot framework activities. To do this, you can use a [sample mock channel service](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Samples/tree/master/blog-samples/CSharp/MockChannel).
3. Send a message to the bot
In the message, include an authorization header, and pass in the access_token you retrieved earlier

**Tips**

- Read the recommended document for detailed guidance
- **Do not** use Direct Line to load test your bot
- Create traffic thatâ€™s more realistic for bot users
- The Default State API is a frequent choke/bottleneck

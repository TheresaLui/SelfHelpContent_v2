# Not sure why I get 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

Customers get 429 error status codes when they exceed the transactions per second for their pricing tier.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Common reasons for hitting "429 Rate Limit Exceeded" errors include:**
* If you are using the Free (F0) SKUs of Cognitive Services, there are a monthly quota for the number of calls that can be made and rate limit, in terms of transactions per second or minute. If you've hit this rate limit and are receiving 429 errors, you have two options:
  * Upgrade to a standard paid API tier which has higher call rate limits.
  * Handle the 429 error and retry the operation using something like an exponential back off retry policy.
  * Some Cognitive Services APIs can be manually upgraded to a higher TPS limit by the Product Group via support case.

**Text Translator Quotas**
* If you are using the Text Translator and receive a 429000, 429001, 429002 error, it could also indicate that you've exceeded request limits

# Error: 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

This error can occur when using Cognitive Services or Text Translator. 

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you're using a Free (F0) SKU of Cognitive Services and receive 429 errors, you have two solutions:
  * Upgrade to a standard paid API tier with a higher call-rate limit. FO SKUs are limited to a monthly transaction quota for the number of calls made and a rate limit (per second or minute). Cognitive Services APIs can sometimes be manually upgraded to a higher TPS limit by the Product Group if the support case warrants it. For details about pricing, see [Cognitive Service Pricing FAQ]( https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).
  * Handle the 429 error and retry the operation. To do this, try using an exponential back-off retry policy.

* If you are using the Text Translator and receive a 429000, 429001, 429002 error, it may indicate that you've exceeded request limits. To learn more about Cognitive Services Text Translator quota limits, see [Request limits for Translator]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/request-limits#character-limits-per-hour) and [Translator reference]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference).

# Resource health reported as Unknown

Follow these steps to resolve unknown resource health issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the data factory has any new success runs, the resource health reported for the factory should NOT be **unknown**.
2. If unknown status is reported, update the factory from the Azure portal by [adding a temporary tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources#portal), as the first troubleshooting step.
3. After the factory update, the resource health status of the factory should update accordingly based on the success or failure percentage of runs in Azure Factory.

# Resource health reported as Unknown

Please follow the below steps to resolve "Unkown" resource health issue

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the datafactory has any new success runs, the resource health reported for the factory should NOT be "unknown".
2. If unknown status is reported, please update the factory from Azure portal by simply [adding a temporary tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources#portal), as the first troubleshooting step.
3. After the factory update, resource health status of the factory should update accordingly based on success or failure percentage of runs in factory.

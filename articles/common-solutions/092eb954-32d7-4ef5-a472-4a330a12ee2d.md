# Common issues with rerun

Resolve common issues with `rerun` by reviewing these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

## My activity reran even though it shouldn't have.

Here's a list of activities that will always run:
1. Wait
2. Set Variable
3. Filter
4. Until. Activity will evaluate the expression and will loop until the condition is satisfied. Inner activities may still be skipped based on the rerun rules.
5. Foreach. Activity will always loop on the items it receives. Inner activities may still be skipped based on the rerun rules.
6. If and switch. Conditions will always be evaluated. Inner activities may still be skipped based on the rerun rules.
7. Execute pipeline activity. The child pipeline will be triggered, but all activities in the child pipeline may still be skipped based on the rerun rules.

### Activity that succeeded on retry was rerun

If your activity succeeded on retry, but you're still seeing it running on a rerun, create a support case.

## How do rerun rules work to determine the first activity that will run?

We have 3 different rerun options: 

1. **Rerun the whole pipeline**. This will start from the first activity.
2. **Rerun from activity**. You can choose which activity is the first one that will run. Activities before this one will be skipped. The activity selected and all the activities after that one that are connected to it will rerun.
3. **Rerun from failure**. This gets all the activities marked as failed and will rerun all those activities, as well as those activities after them that are connected in the dependency tree.

Starting from a container activity (activity that contains other activities inside like foreach, until, if) will run everything inside it.

# Adding a share

Before you add shares to your Data Box Gateway, ensure that you've done the following:

- Provision a virtual device and connected to it as detailed in the Provision a Data Box Gateway in Hyper-V or Provision a Data Box Gateway in VMware.
- Activate the virtual device, following the directions in https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-deploy-connect-setup-activate 

The device is now ready for you to create shares and transfer data.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Provide a unique name for your share. The share names can only have lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The share name must have between 3 and 63 characters long and begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character.
- Select a Type for the share. The type can be SMB or NFS, with SMB being the default. SMB is the standard for Windows clients, and NFS is used for Linux clients. Depending upon whether you choose SMB or NFS shares, options presented are slightly different.
- Provide a storage account where the share will reside. If a container doesn't already exist, it's created in the storage account with the newly created share name. If the container already exists, that container is used.

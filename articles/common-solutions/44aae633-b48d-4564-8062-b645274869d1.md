# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended steps**

### **Enable multi-factor authentication in Azure Active Directory B2C** 

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) integrates directly with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication so that you can add a second layer of security to sign-up and sign-in experiences in your applications. You can enable multi-factor authentication without writing a single line of code. For more information, see [Steps to enable multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/multi-factor-authentication?pivots=b2c-user-flow&WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).


### **Can I use Conditional Access Policies for my Azure Active Directory B2C tenant?** 

Yes, you can create Conditional Access policies that use these risk detections to determine actions and enforce organizational policies. [Set up Identity Protection and Conditional Access for Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/conditional-access-identity-protection-setup) 

### **Can I integrate Conditional Access with user flows and custom policies?** 

* [Learn how to Add Conditional Access to user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/conditional-access-user-flow?pivots=b2c-user-flow). 

### **Identity Protection dashboard**

Your investigation into risk will typically start with the Identity Protection dashboard. The dashboard gives you access to: 

* Reports such as [Risky users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risky-users), [Risky sign-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risky-sign-ins), and [Risk detections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#risk-detections). 

* Configuration settings for your Security Policies, [Notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support), and [multi-factor authentication registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 

In addition to investigation, you can configure an automated response for specific sign-in risk levels via the [sign-in risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/conditional-access-identity-protection-setup#to-create-a-conditional-access-policy). In your response, you can block access to your resources or require passing a [multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) to gain access.

# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended steps**

* **What is b2c-extensions-app in my Azure AD B2C tenant?** 

   When an Azure AD B2C directory is created, an app called `b2c-extensions-app` is visible in App registrations. This app is used by the Azure AD B2C service to store information about users and custom attributes. If the app is deleted, Azure AD B2C will not function correctly and your production environment will be affected. [Verify that the extensions app is present](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/extensions-app). 

   If you accidentally deleted the b2c-extensions-app, you have 30 days to recover it. [Steps to recover the extensions app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/extensions-app#recover-the-extensions-app).

# How do I Use Azure Marketplace Modules?

Azure Marketplace Modules may be added to Azure IoT Edge deployments from the marketplace itself or adding a marketplace module in the deployment wizards.

Each Azure Marketplace Module will have "Useful Links" and "Contact information" sections in the Marketplace offering.

## **Recommended Steps**

To find the offering, please go to the [Azure Marketplace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home), select "Internet of Things" on the sidebar and search or scroll through to find the offering. 

Some modules of particular interest to customers: 

- Blob Storage: More information may be found in [the Azure IoT Edge documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-store-data-blob)
- IIOT OPC Publisher and IIOT OPC Twin: More documentation may be found at [the industrial IoT GitHub page](https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT)
- Azure Security Center: [How to Deploy the security module in Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/asc-for-iot/how-to-deploy-edge)

This module by default mounts the root filesystem (`/`) into the container as `/host` and reads from the `/host/var` directory. Symbolic links to hard paths in host's `/var` may need to be added as additional bind mounts to resolve those links.

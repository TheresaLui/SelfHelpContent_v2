# Download Image to Device

Copy any disk images to be used into page blobs in the local storage account that you created in previous steps. You can use a tool such as AzCopy to upload the VHD to the storage account that you created. Before you use AzCopy, make sure that the AzCopy is configured correctly for use with the blob storage REST API version that you are using with your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Set the BlobType:
    -  to **page** when creating a managed disk out of VHD
    -  to **block** when writing to tiered storage accounts using AzCopy
2.	Download the disk images from the marketplace or create your own

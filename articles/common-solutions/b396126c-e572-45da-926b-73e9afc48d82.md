# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

* **What are the different type of user accounts that can be created in B2C?** 

   Get an [Overview of user accounts in Azure Active Directory B2C (AD B2C)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-overview).

* **Creating  users into Azure AD B2C** 

   The only way to create AD B2C users who can sign in through your B2C integrated app is either: 

    * Have the user sign-up via a [sign-up or sign-up/sign-in policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#create-a-sign-up-policy)  

    * Use the [Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/manage-user-accounts-graph-api?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support) 

   Although consumer accounts in an Azure AD B2C directory are most commonly created when users sign up to use one of your applications, you can create them programmatically and by using the Azure portal.[Use the Azure portal to create and delete consumer users in Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/manage-users-portal).

* **Can I migrate existing consumer user accounts from any identity provider to Azure AD B2C?** 

   Yes, you can migrate existing consumer user accounts from any identity provider to Azure AD B2C. For more information, see [Migrate users to Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-migration).

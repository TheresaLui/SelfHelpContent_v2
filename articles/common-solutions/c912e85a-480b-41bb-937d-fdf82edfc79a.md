# Business to Consumer (B2C)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **What is a custom policy/Identity Experience Framework?**
Custom policies are configuration files that define the behavior of your Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenant. Get an [Azure AD B2C custom policy overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-trust-frameworks).

### **What is a UserJourney?**
[User journeys](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/userjourneys) specify explicit paths through which a policy allows a relying party application to obtain the desired claims for a user. The user is taken through these paths to retrieve the claims that are to be presented to the relying party. 

### **What is a RelyingParty?**
The [RelyingParty](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/relyingparty) element specifies the user journey to enforce for the current request to Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). It also specifies the list of claims that the relying party (RP) application needs as part of the issued token. 

### **What is a ClaimsProvider and a TechnicalProfile?**
A [ClaimsProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/claimsproviders) contains a set of [TechnicalProfiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/technicalprofiles). Every claims provider must have one or more technical profiles that determine the endpoints and the protocols needed to communicate with the claims provider. 

### **What is a ContentDefinition?**
You can customize the look and feel of any self-asserted technical profile in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) using [ContentDefinitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/contentdefinitions).

### **What is a ClaimsSchema?**
The [ClaimsSchema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/claimsschema) element defines the claim types that can be referenced as part of the policy. Claims schema is the place where you declare your claims. 

### **What is a ClaimsTransformation?**
The [ClaimsTransformations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/claimstransformations) element contains a list of claims transformation functions that can be used in user journeys as part of a custom policy. A claims transformation converts a given claim into another one.

### **How does inheritance work in a custom policy?**
Learn about the [Inheritance model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-trust-frameworks#inheritance-model) in a custom policy.

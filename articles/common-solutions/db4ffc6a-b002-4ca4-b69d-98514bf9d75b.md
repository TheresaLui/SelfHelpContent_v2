# Device Does not Boot up

The first thing to check is around the Power Supply, both of them should be on for healthy state of the device. You can shut down or restart your physical device using the local web UI. We recommend that before you restart, take the shares offline on the data server and then the device. This action minimizes any possibility of data corruption.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the local web UI, go to Maintenance and Power settings
2. Select Shutdown or Restart, depending on what you intend to do

# Slow performance

For upload, use multithreading and check bandwidth or see if there are multiple streams. Use AzCopy and multi-thread for download.

## **Recommended Steps**

You can Monitor the device metrics on your dashboard:

* Cloud bytes uploaded (share): Bytes uploaded per share
* Cloud download throughput (share): Bytes downloaded per share
* Cloud read throughput:	Sum of all the bytes read from the cloud across all the shares on your device
* Cloud upload throughput:	Sum of all the bytes written to the cloud across all the shares

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Monitoring performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-monitor)

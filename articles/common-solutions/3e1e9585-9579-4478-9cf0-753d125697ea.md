# Azure Migrate: Server Migration replication issues

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Migrate AWS VMs to Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137866)
* [Migrate physical servers/bare metal servers to Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137867)
* [Migrate servers from other clouds (GCP, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud etc.) to Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137963). You can migrate most x64 servers by treating them as physical servers for the purpose of migration.
* [Migrate Azure VMs from one Azure region to another using Azure Site Recovery](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137868)

**Troubleshoot issues with replication**
For troubleshooting common issues with Azure Migrate server replication, see [the troubleshooting article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149009)

**Troublsehoot issues with replication appliance (Configuration Server)**
For troubleshooting common issues with replication appliance installation, see [the troubleshooting article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149008) 

**Installation issues with Mobility service agent**
1. Machines with Secure Boot aren't supported. Disable Secure Boot, and retry installation. 
2. Check if installation failed due to missing [OS updates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137871)
3. Check if installation failed due to insufficient boot space on [Linux VMs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137964)

For other errors with Mobility Service installation, [refer the troubleshooting article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149002) 

**Error 78188: Replication critical due to high churn**
This can happen when the data change rate (write bytes/sec) on the disks of the virtual machines under replication is more than the [supported limits](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2137870) for the target disks. Follow the [guidance in the troubleshooting article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148749) to resolve the issue.

If you see this issue consistently, use Premium Managed Disks. If you're replicating to Standard HDD/SSD, then upgrade to Premium SSD. To do this, disable replication for the VM, and enable replication again with Premium SSD disks selected for replication.

**Troubleshoot source machines that aren't available for replication**
This issue occurs most frequently when there are duplicate entries in the system. [Follow the guidance to troubleshoot the issue](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148986).

**Unable to select assessments for Physical servers**
The option to import migration settings from an assessment is currently unavailable for migrating physical servers/bare metal servers, servers from other clouds (GCP, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud etc.) to Azure. Select the option to specify migration settings manually to proceed. 


**Troubleshoot connectivity between the Mobility service on the replicating machine and the Configuration Server, and between the replicating machine and a Scale-out Process Server**

- Ensure that the Mobility Service software on the replicating machine is in a running state running. On Windows machines open services (Run > services.msc) and validate that the "InMage Scout VX Agent â€“ Sentinel/Outpost" is running. On Linux, run `sudo ps -ef | grep Vx` and ensure that the Vx agent process is running.
- Validate that the Mobility service on the replicating machine is able to connect to the Configuration Server on TCP ports 443 and 9443, and if you are using a scale-out process server that it is able to connect to the Process Server on TCP port 9443

  - **Checking connectivity to Configuration Server from a Windows machine:** Log in to the machine and open PowerShell. In PowerShell run `Test-NetConnection <ConfigurationServer IP address> - Port 443` and `Test-NetConnection <ConfigurationServer IP address> -Port 9443`. The cmdlet should return `TcpTestSucceeded : True` if connectivity exists.
  - **Checking connectivity to Scale-out Process Server from a Windows machine:** Log in to the machine and open PowerShell. In PowerShell run `Test-NetConnection <Scale-OutProcessServer IP address> -Port 9443`. The cmdlet should return `TcpTestSucceeded : True` if connectivity exists.
  - **Checking connectivity to Configuration Server from a Linux machine:** Log in to the Linux machine and open shell. Use the telnet utility to test connectivity to TCP ports 443 and 9443 of the Configuration Server. Run `telnet <ConfigurationServerIPAddress>:443` and `telnet <ConfigurationServerIPAddress>:9443`. If connectivity exists the telnet client will be able to open these connections to the Configuration Server.
  - **Checking connectivity to scale-out Process Server from a Linux machine:** Log in to the Linux machine and open shell. Run `telnet <Scale-OutProcessServerIPAddress>:9443`. If connectivity exists the telnet client will be able to open a connection on port 9443 of the scale-out Process Server.
Connectivity from the Mobility service to the Configuration Server or Process Server could be impacted due to one of these reasons:

    * The network communication paths have been blocked off due to a firewall or routing configuration
    * The Configuration Server or Process Server machines are powered off
    * The Configuration Server process ('cxpsprocessserver' in services.msc) that listens on port 443 is not running
    * The Process Server process ('tmansvc' in services.msc) than listens on port 9443 is not running

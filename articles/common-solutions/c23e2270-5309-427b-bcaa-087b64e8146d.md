# Cannot Connect to SQL Instance

Most customers can resolve their SQL Connectivity issues using the steps and recommended documents below.

## **Recommended Steps**

  * **Error:"Cannot Generate SSPI Context"** while connecting to SQL Server

    Connectivity to SQL may fail because of SPN duplication, or incorrectly registered or missing entries. To resolve these SPN issues, log in to the VM as **Domain Administrator** and [Run Kerberos Configuration Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39046).

  * **SQL Service does not start because of missing TempDB folders**

     If you restarted your VM or resized your VM, SQL may not start because of Tempdb Files/Folders missing on the D Drive. We are working on a fix for this. Meanwhile, you can resolve the issue by running the following script, which creates the TempDB structure:
     
    ```PS
      $SQLService="SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)"
      $SQLAgentService="SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)"
      $tempfolder="D:\tempDB\Data"
      $logfolder="D:\tempDB\Log"
      if (!(test-path -path $tempfolder))
       {    
       New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $logfolder  
       New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $tempfolder
       }
       Start-Service $SQLService 
       Start-Service $SQLAgentService
      ````

   * **Login Failures for Account "NT SERVICE\\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery"**

     To resolve, uninstall and [reinstall the SQL IaaS Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm?tabs=bash%2Cazure-cli#lightweight-management-mode). Installing of Fullweight Management Mode for the IaaS Extension requires that you restart the SQL Service. Make sure that you have this as a login in your SQL Server, or that you run the following script:
     
     ```SQL
      CREATE LOGIN [NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master]
      GO
      ALTER SERVER ROLE [sysadmin] ADD MEMBER [NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery]
      GO
      ```

  *   **Azure Active Directory authentication/connectivity is not supported with Azure SQL VM**

      SQL Server on Azure VM supports Windows Authentication and SQL Authentication. [Learn more]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview).

   * **I forgot sysadmin (sa) password, how do I login to SQL Server Instance** 

     To gain access to SQL Server, run the following command in the command prompt with Administrator permissions. Replace `Domain\login` with your domain and the desired user:
     
     ```SQL    
      NET STOP MSSQLSERVER
      NET START MSSQLSERVER /m"SQLCMD"
      sqlcmd -S MY_SERVER_NAME
      CREATE LOGIN [Domain\login] FROM WINDOWS; 
      GO
      ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER [Domain\login];
      Go
      Exit
      NET STOP MSSQLSERVER
      NET start MSSQLSERVER
     ```

* **90% of SQL instance connectivity issues are resolved by following these recommendations**

    * If you have issues connecting to SQL Server Instance on Azure VM from a different network or on-premises, [review this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/ways-to-connect-to-sql)

   * Ensure that the port used by SQL Server (1433) is open for inbound/outbound connections. You can [telnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/telnet) to the port or use [Test-NetConnection](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=win10-ps#example-3--test-tcp-connectivity-and-display-detailed-results) to check if it's blocked at **NSG or Windows Firewall**. Check with your network admin to make sure your company firewall is not blocking these connections. You must add an outbound rule from where you make a connection for the SQL Port to the Windows firewall and the company firewall.  

   * Make sure to enable TCP/IP and shared memory in the [SQL server configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-ver15#SSMSProcedure).

  * You may see intermittent connectivity issues to SQL instance if your AG failed over, if you are having AG [lease timeouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-lease-healthcheck-timeout?view=sql-server-ver15#updating-cluster-and-always-on-timeout-values), if you are having issues with [SQL Performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices), network issues, or [disk or VM throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disk-performance-windows#storage-io-utilization-metrics). Check the SQL error log to find out more.

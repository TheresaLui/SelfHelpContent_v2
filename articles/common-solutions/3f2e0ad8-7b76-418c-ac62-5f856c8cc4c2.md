# Pipeline is stuck or queued  for a long time - How To 

If the ADF pipeline is stuck or queued for long time, you can resolve the issue by using the following recommendations.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Long time running issues
* If your pipeline has a concurrency policy, verify that there are no old pipeline runs in progress. The maximum pipeline concurrency allowed in Azure Data Factory is 10 pipelines. 

* Go to the ADF authoring canvas, select your pipeline, and determine if it has a concurrency property  assigned to it. If it does, go to the Monitoring view, and make sure there's nothing in the past 45 days that's in progress. If there is something in progress, you can cancel it and the new pipeline run should start.

### Transient issues
* It's possible that your run was impacted by a transient network or service outage issue in general. If this happens, Azure Data Factory has an internal recovery process that monitors all the runs and starts them when it notices that something went wrong. 
* This process happens every hour, so if your run is stuck for more than an hour, create a support case.

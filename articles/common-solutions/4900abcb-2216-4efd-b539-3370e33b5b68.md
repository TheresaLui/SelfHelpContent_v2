# Unable to order a device 

Before you begin an order for an Azure Stack Edge device, make sure the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-deploy-prep#prerequisites) are in place.


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Supported Microsoft Azure subscriptions are enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. 
   <br>Supported subscriptions include:
   - [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/)
   - [Cloud Solution provider or CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp)
   - [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). 
   <br>Pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not supported.

2. You must have owner or contributor access at the resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources
3. Make sure that the Microsoft.DataBoxEdge provider is registered in your subscription. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode#register-resource-providers). 
   - If you face difficulty registering the resource provider, [see this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider) 

4. Ensure that the creation of Azure Stack Edge resources is not blocked by any [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview) enforced by your system admin

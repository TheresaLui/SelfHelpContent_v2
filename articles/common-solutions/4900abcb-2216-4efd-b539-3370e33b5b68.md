# Unable to order a device 

Before you begin to order, make sure that all the prerequisites mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-deploy-prep#prerequisites) are in place.


## **Recommended Steps**

1. Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution provider or CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not supported.
2. You must have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources
3. You need to make sure that the Microsoft.DataBoxEdge provider is registered in your subscription. For information on how to register, go to [Register resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-manage-access-power-connectivity-mode#register-resource-providers). Refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider) if you face any difficulty in registering the Resource Provider.
4. Ensure that the creation of Azure Stack Edge resources is not blocked by any [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview) enforced by your system admin

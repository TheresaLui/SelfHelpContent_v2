# Pipeline error handling

When a pipeline fails, one or multiple activity dependencies along the path are causing it to fail. Azure Data Factory determines the overall success or failure of a pipeline by evaluating the outcome for all activities along the path. This way, it can determine whether to continue executing each subsequent activity.

## Recommended Steps

1. Check the status of all pipeline activities and their dependency conditions to verify that they are succeeding or failing, as expected.

   A common failure scenario is when error handling is incorporated into the pipeline. Two common blocks that are used to incorporate error handling are **TRY-CATCH** and **DO-IF-ELSE**. A DO-IF-ELSE approach will result in a pipeline failure if the Upon Failure path is enacted.

   **The following tables shows dependencies that will result in pipeline failure.**

   |Activity1 Status|Conditional path|Activity2 Status|Conditional path|Activity3 Status|Pipeline outcome|
   |--|--|--|--|--|--|
   |Failure|Upon Success|Skipped| | |Failure|
   |Failure|Upon Success|Skipped|Upon Failure|Success|Failure|
   Failure|Upon Success|Skipped|Upon Failure|Failure|Failure|
   Failure|Upon Success|Skipped|Upon Completion|Success|Failure|
   Failure|Upon Success|Skipped|Upon Completion|Failure|Failure|
   Success|Upon Success|Failure| | |Failure|
   Success|Upon Completion|Failure| | |Failure|
   Failure|Upon Failure|Failure| | |Failure|
   Failure|Upon Completion|Failure| | |Failure|
   Success|Upon Success|Failure|Upon Failure|Skipped|Failure|
   Success|Upon Success|Success|Upon Completion|Failure|Failure|
   Success|Upon Success|Failure|Upon Completion|Success|Failure|

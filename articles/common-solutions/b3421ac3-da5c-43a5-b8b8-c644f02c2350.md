# Text Analytics Analyze API
### Getting Started

* Text Analytics (TA) has introduced a new asynchronous API in preview which combines multiple text analytics feature in one call
* The API is called the [/analyze endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-call-api?tabs=synchronous#using-the-api-asynchronously) and currently combines: key phrase extraction, named entity recognition, and entity recognition PII/PHI features
* Use this API if you need to analyze text documents larger than 5K characters with one of the above supported capabilities instead of chunking the text
* See [data limits](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/concepts/data-limits?tabs=version-3#data-limits) for a comparison of the `/analyze` operation and a single synchronous TA capability

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Go to the [Azure portal to create your Text Analytics (TA) resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics)
1. Select one of the regions that currently support the analyze operation: West US2, East US2, West Europe, North Europe, and Central US
1. Choose a [standard (S) pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) Text Analytics resource. The `/analyze` operation is currently only available within the S pricing tier.
1. Using the `/analyze` operation will not incur extra costs, but follows the same pricing criteria of the S tier when using the TA features
1. If you have an existing S Text Analytics resource created in one of the above 5 supported Azure regions, you can call the `/analyze` operation with it   


## **Recommended Documents**

* [POST and GET endpoint APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-call-api?tabs=analyze#set-up-a-request) that can be used to call the analyze operation
* Example of the [analyze operation POST request format](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v3-1-preview-3/operations/Analyze)
* An **Operation-Location** header job ID will be returned after [sending the POST request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-call-api?tabs=analyze#send-the-request)
* Use this Job ID to get the final response when [sending the GET request](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics-v3-1-preview-3/operations/AnalyzeStatus)

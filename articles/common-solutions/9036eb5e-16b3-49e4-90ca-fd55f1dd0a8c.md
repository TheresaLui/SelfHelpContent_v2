# Troubleshooting networking issues with ACR

Networking issues with Azure Container Registry are most often caused by firewall or virtual network misconfigurations. Most users are able to resolve their networking issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Check client firewall access configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-access#configure-client-firewall-access).
2. [Check public access to the registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-access#configure-public-access-to-registry).
3. [Check VNet access configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-access#configure-vnet-access).
4. [Check service access configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-access#configure-service-access).
5. If you are accessing your registry from a machine on your premises, check the networking access from your premises. You can leverage tools like `traceroute` and `dig` to investigate the connectivity from your premises.

To see more detailed troubleshooting information, including networking errors, you should enable the resource logs as described in the [following article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-diagnostics-audit-logs).

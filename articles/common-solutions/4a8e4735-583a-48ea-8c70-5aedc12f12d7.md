## Azure Migrate: Common questions and issues

### **How to check whether user has appropriate access to create a project**
To create a project, user needs Owner or Contributor permissions. [Learn how to determine if you have the required access.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access)

### **Don't see a particular geography when creating the Azure Migrate project**
You can use a project in any geography to perform a migration to an Azure region of your choice. Review the supported geographies for [public clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix#supported-geographies-public-cloud) and [government clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix#supported-geographies-azure-government).
  
### **Do I need to pay for Azure Migrate and the non-Microsoft ISV tools that I plan to use?**
Azure Migrate and the first-party Server Assessment and Server Migration tools are available at [no additional charge](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-migrate). However, you may incur charges for using integrated non-Microsoft ISV assessment and migration tools.
  
### **ISV tools that are available in other geographies are not listed in Azure Government**
ISV partners are in the process of enabling their tools in Azure Government for Azure Migrate. Meanwhile, you can either use the partner tool independently or use any of the listed tools.

### **Discover and assess SQL Server instances and databases for migration to Azure SQL (preview)**
Discovery and assessment of SQL Server instances and databases is available only for projects created in **Australia East** region using [**preview link**](https://aka.ms/AzureMigrate/SQL). Know more about [SQL Discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware) and [SQL assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-assess-sql)

## **Recommended Steps**

### **How to check whether user has appropriate access to create a project**
To create a project, a user needs Owner or Contributor permissions. [Check here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access) to see if you have the required access.

### **I don't see a particular geography when creating the Azure Migrate project**

You can use a project in any geography to perform a migration to an Azure region of your choice. Review the supported geographies for [public](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix#supported-geographies-public-cloud) and [government clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix#supported-geographies-azure-government).
  
### **Do I need to pay for Azure Migrate and the non-Microsoft ISV tools that I plan to use?**

Azure Migrate and the first party Server Assessment and Server Migration tools are available at [no additional charge](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-migrate). However, you may incur charges for using integrated non-Microsoft ISV assessment and migration tools.
  
### **ISV tools that are available in other geographies are not listed in Azure Government**

ISV partners are in process of enabling their tools in Azure Government for Azure Migrate. Meanwhile, you can either use the partner tool independently or use any of the listed tools.

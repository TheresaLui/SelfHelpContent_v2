# Testing and training Knowledge Base


### **Frequently Asked Questions**

* **How can I test my knowledge base?**

  You can test your knowledge base on the portal itself, using the test pane. You can also test the knowledge base by setting the parameter `isTest` as True in your generateAnswer API call. 

* **Can I do batch testing over my knowledge base, instead of querying one at a time and inspecting?**

   QnA Maker supports batch testing. Follow the steps here for [batch testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/how-to/test-knowledge-base?tabs=v1#batch-test-with-tool).

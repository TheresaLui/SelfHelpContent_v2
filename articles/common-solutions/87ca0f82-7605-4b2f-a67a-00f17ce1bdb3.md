# Get information about certificates

## **Recommended Steps** 

* [How Azure IoT Edge uses certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-certs)
* [Manage certificates on an IoT Edge device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-manage-device-certificates) for production
* [Set up X.509 security in your Azure IoT hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-x509-get-started)
* [Create demo certificates to test IoT Edge device features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-create-test-certificates)
 
Some CA providers are standing up private roots for IoT use and operate under rules that are more aware of IoT scenarios such as local provisioning for global management and offline operation support. Please contact your preferred commercial CA provider to see if they offer this service. 

We recommend going to the commercial providers for Azure IoT Edge certificates or seek help from experts with setting up and running a corporate or enterprise PKI tree fit for the purpose.

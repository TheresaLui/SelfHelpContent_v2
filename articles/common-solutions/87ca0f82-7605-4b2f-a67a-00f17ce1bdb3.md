# Get information about certificates

## **Recommended Steps** 

**1.1 (and earlier)**

* [How Azure IoT Edge uses certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-certs?view=iotedge-2018-06)
* [Manage certificates on an IoT Edge device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-manage-device-certificates?view=iotedge-2018-06) for production
* [Set up X.509 security in your Azure IoT hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-x509-get-started?view=iotedge-2018-06)
* [Create demo certificates to test IoT Edge device features](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-create-test-certificates?view=iotedge-2018-06)
 
**1.2 (and later)**

* [How Azure IoT Edge uses certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-certs?view=iotedge-2020-11)

**External Information**

Some CA providers are standing up private roots for IoT use and operate under rules that are more aware of IoT scenarios (such as local provisioning for global management and offline operation support). Contact your preferred commercial CA provider to see if they offer this service. 

We recommend going to the commercial providers for Azure IoT Edge certificates, or seek help from experts with setting up and running a corporate or enterprise PKI tree fit for the purpose.

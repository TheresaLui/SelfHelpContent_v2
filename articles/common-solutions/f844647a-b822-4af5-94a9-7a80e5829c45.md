# Can't get my TLS to work

In order to create a solution with the Embedded C SDK, customers need to bring their own MQTT client, TLs and socket. the below are some guidelines in term of where to find help in case the issue was found in one of our samples or on you own code. 

## **Recommended Steps**

### Issue found in one of our samples

If the customer has used one of our samples as a base to develop their application (against the same stacks and APIs used by the samples), the customer must refer to all the proper calls in those samples to ensure their system can connect and work properly with the Azure IoT Hub.

Locations of our samples:

* [Hub samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/samples/iot/hub)
* [Device Provisioning samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/samples/iot/provisioning)

Samples also have detailed step-by-step guides. Please explore more [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/samples/iot/hub#azure-iot-hub-samples).
	
### Issue not found in one of our samples

In cases where the customer code is not directly based on any of the samples we do provide, the customer must consult with the developer of TLS/socket layers for guidance (e.g., WolfSSL, OpenSSL, etc).

All the basic requirements of the Azure IoT Hub for socket security will apply to any SSL API used.

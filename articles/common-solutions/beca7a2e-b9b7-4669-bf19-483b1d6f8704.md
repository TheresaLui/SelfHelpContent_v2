# Device Update

Device updates are critical in keeping your device up-to-date. You can perform updates through the local UI or the Azure portal.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the **Device updates** blade, check that you have reviewed the license terms associated with new features in the release notes
2. Choose to download and install the updates, or just download the updates and install them later 

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Apply updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-install-update)

### Notes:
* Installing an update or hotfix restarts your device. Your device is a single node device and applying an update disrupts your device. Your device experiences a downtime of up to 30 minutes.
* Before you install updates, make sure that the device is healthy and the status shows as **Online**.

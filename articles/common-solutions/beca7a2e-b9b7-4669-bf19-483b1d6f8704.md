# Device Update

Device updates are a very critical part of the device upkeep. Updates can be done through the Local UI or Azure portal.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the Device updates blade, check that you have reviewed the license terms associated with new features in the release notes
2. You can choose to download and install the updates, or just download the updates and install them later.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Details for installing updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-install-update)


### Notes:

* Keep in mind that installing an update or hotfix restarts your device. Given that the Data Box Gateway is a single node device, any I/O in progress is disrupted and your device experiences a downtime of up to 30 minutes for the device software update.
* Make sure that the device is healthy and status shows as **Online** before you proceed to install the updates

# Windows Hello for Business Cert Trust deployment issues

Most users are able to resolve their Windows Hello for Business (WHFB) Cert Trust issue using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Issue provisioning WHFB in cert trust deployment**
1. Make sure that all prerequisites for Hybrid Cert Trust have been met. See [Hybrid Windows Hello for Business Prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-cert-trust-prereqs).
2. Run `DSREGCMD /Status` from PowerShell and review the output for the **NGC Prerequisite Check**. Confirm that the `CertificateEnrollment` field shows `CertEnrollment: enrollment authority` and that all other checks are passing. 
3. If you do not see `CertEnrollment: enrollment authority` in the output of `DSREGCMD /Status`, review the policy configurations for Windows Hello for Business and verify that **"User certificate for on-premises authentication"** is set to **true**. See[Policy Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-policy#policy-configuration).
4. If the **AdfsRaIsReady** check is failing, make sure that the registration authority is configured in ADFS. See[Configure Windows Hello for Business: Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-adfs).
5. If the **LogonCertTemplateReady** check is failing, make sure that the Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate template is configured properly and published. See [Creating Windows Hello for Business authentication certificate template
](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-pki#creating-windows-hello-for-business-authentication-certificate-template).

**Issue signing in with WHFB in cert trust deployment**
1. Make sure the domain controller certificate is in the **NTAuth store**. If you're using a non-Microsoft Enterprise CA, this might not be done by default and authentication will fail.

# Issues with Prepare of the resources

## **Recommended Steps**
1. Before preparing VMs, please ensure you have committed the Source Resource Group and it's in Delete source pending state
2. Before preparing Elastic Pools and SQL Dbs, please ensure you have source SQL Server moved first, and in a Delete source pending state
3. To prepare the SQL DB that's in an elastic pool, initiate the move for the elastic pool first, and then prepare the database
4. Please ensure you have validated dependencies before prepare of the resource
5. When you are doing prepare of resources, until state changes from "prepare pending" to "prepare in progress" (with the % bar showing up), 
   you cannot do any parallel operations on any other resource in the move collection

### Target region has quota issues

1. Check that the target subscription has enough quota to create VMs and related resources in the target region.
If it doesn't have enough quota, you need to request additional limits.

# Issues with Prepare of the resources

Most users can resolve issues with preparing resources by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Before preparing the VMs, ensure that you have committed the Source Resource Group and that it's in the **Delete source pending** state
2. Before preparing the elastic pools and SQL database, ensure that you have the source SQL Server moved first, and that it's in a **Delete source pending** state
3. To prepare the SQL database that's in an elastic pool, initiate the move for the elastic pool first, and then prepare the database
4. Ensure that you have validated dependencies before preparing the resource
5. When you are preparing the resources, until the state changes from **Prepare pending** to **Prepare in progress** (with the % progress bar appearing), 
   you cannot do any parallel operations on any other resource in the move collection

### Target region has quota issues

1. Check that the target subscription has enough quota to create VMs and related resources in the target region
2. If the target subscription doesn't have enough quota, request additional limits

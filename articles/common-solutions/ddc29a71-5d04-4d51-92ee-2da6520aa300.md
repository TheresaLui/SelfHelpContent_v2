# **Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network**

## **Recommended Steps**

* Managed Azure Private Endpoints are Private Endpoints created in the Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network, which establish a private link to Azure resources. Azure Data Factory manages these Private Endpoints on your behalf. 
  - See [Managed Private Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#managed-private-endpoints) for information about creating, approving, and maintaining Private Endpoints. 
  - When you create a Linked Service for Azure Key Vault, there is no Azure Integration Runtime reference. Therefore, you can't create a Private Endpoint during the Linked Service creation of Azure Key Vault. However, you can create a Private Endpoint for the Azure Key Vault Linked Service when you create Linked Service for data stores, which references the Azure Key Vault Linked Service, which in turn references Azure Integration Runtime with Managed Virtual Network enabled.

**Note:** We're working on supporting more data sources. For all current Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network supported data sources, see [supported data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#supported-data-sources).

* We're working on more region support in Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network. For all current supported regions, see [supported regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#azure-data-factory-managed-virtual-network-is-available-in-the-following-azure-regions).

# **Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network**

Managed private endpoints are private endpoints created in the Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network, which establishes a private link to Azure resources. Azure Data Factory manages these private endpoints on your behalf.

Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 are not supported to be connected through public endpoint from ADF Managed Virtual Network per doc [Managed virtual network & managed private endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#outbound-communications-through-public-endpoint-from-adf-managed-virtual-network), more detail about the troubleshooting via private link, please refer to [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/security-and-access-control-troubleshoot-guide)

## **Recommended Steps**

* For information about creating, approving, and maintaining Managed private endpoints, see [Managed private endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#managed-private-endpoints). 
* When you create a Linked Service for Azure Key Vault, there is no Azure Integration Runtime reference. Therefore, you can't create a private endpoint during the Linked Service creation of Azure Key Vault. However, you can create a private endpoint for the Azure Key Vault Linked Service when you create Linked Service for data stores, which references the Azure Key Vault Linked Service, which in turn references Azure Integration Runtime, with Managed Virtual Network enabled.

**Note:** We're working on supporting more data sources. For all current Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network supported data sources, see [supported data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#supported-data-sources).

* We're working on more region support in Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network. For all current supported regions, see [supported regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint#azure-data-factory-managed-virtual-network-is-available-in-the-following-azure-regions).

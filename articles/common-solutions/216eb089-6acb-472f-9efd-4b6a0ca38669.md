# Problems with Model Explanations in Experiments
Most users are able to resolve their model explanation issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**
### Uploading a model explanation dashboard from the SDK
Create a training script in a Jupyter notebook to submit a [remote explanation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-aml#generate-feature-importance-values-via-remote-runs) by setting up AzureML Compute target as your compute target and submitting your remote run. 

The steps shown in these [sample notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/explain-model/azure-integration/remote-explanation) may be useful.

### Accessing the model explanation dashboard from the Experiments UI

Once you've uploaded your model explanations to Azure Machine Learning Run History you can view the dashboard in Azure Machine Learning studio UI by:

1. Select Experiments in the left pane to see a list of experiments that you've run on Azure Machine Learning
2. Select a particular experiment to view all the runs in that experiment
3. Select a run, and then the Explanations tab to the explanation visualization dashboard

# Issues with Remove of resources

Error: The source resource cannot be deleted as the resource is used as dependency by dependent source resource

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This resource is being used by another resource as dependency 

2. Remove the resource using this as a dependency first, then remove this resource. For example, if NIC is attached to a VM, the VM has a dependency on NIC. So the VM should be removed first, and then the NIC.

**Note:** The preceding step doesn't remove anything created in the source or target region.

# Issues with Remove of resources

Use these steps to resolve the error: "The source resource cannot be deleted as the resource is used as a dependency by dependent source resource."

## **Recommended Steps**

The resource you're trying to delete is being used by another resource as a dependency.
1. First, you need to remove the resource that's using this as a dependency. For example, if NIC is attached to a VM, the VM has a dependency on NIC. So the VM should be removed first, and then the NIC.
2. Remove this resource. <br>
**Note:** The preceding step doesn't remove anything created in the source or target region.

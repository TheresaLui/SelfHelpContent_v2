# Azure pipelines issues related to self-hosted agents

## **Recommended Steps**

This article addresses issues setting up or using self-hosted agents and deployment group agents in Azure pipelines. If you're having trouble with Microsoft-hosted agents, try the Microsoft-hosted agents category.

Complete the following steps before creating a support ticket. If you need to create a ticket after completing the diagnostic steps, provide information about the path you took and results of the steps you ran to expedite the resolution of your problem.

* I am attempting to connect an agent to Azure DevOps, and it's not working:

	- Make sure the machine's firewall settings allow outbound connections. Azure pipelines agents make an [HTTP connection to Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?#communication).
	- If you require a proxy, ensure it's configured properly. Also make sure the [agent is configured with the proxy details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/proxy).
	- For both the firewall and the proxy, ensure that [all required hostnames are allowed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows#im-running-a-firewall-and-my-code-is-in-azure-repos-what-urls-does-the-agent-need-to-communicate-with). Note that the documentation links to the Windows agent topic, but the same permissions are required for a macOS or Linux agent.
	- Make sure you have [appropriate permissions to configure an agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows#permissions) on Azure DevOps. Note that the documentation links to the Windows agent topic, but the same permissions are required for a macOS or Linux agent.

* I am attempting to update an agent, and it's not working:

	- If you use a proxy or firewall, confirm that connections to [all required hostnames are allowed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows#im-running-a-firewall-and-my-code-is-in-azure-repos-what-urls-does-the-agent-need-to-communicate-with). Note that the documentation links to the Windows agent topic, but the same permissions are required for a macOS or Linux agent.

* My agent is connected, but is never selected to run any jobs:

	- Ensure that your agent advertises all [capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents#capabilities) required by your jobs
	- When you install new software on your agent host, you'll need to restart the agent to pick up new capabilities advertised as environment variables

Most users are able to resolve issues with editing assets by using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

As of today, you cannot change anything manually in the **Edit Asset** screen and have a subsequent run of the scan update your asset. However, we are working on making it possible to update the description, the glossary term, and the classification. Subsequent runs of a scan will then update your asset for new classifications that it finds and other metadata. This is in the plan to be pushed out soon during the Public Preview.

## **Recommended Documents**

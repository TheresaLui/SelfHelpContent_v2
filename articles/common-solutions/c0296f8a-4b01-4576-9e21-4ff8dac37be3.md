Most users are able to resolve issues with editing assets by using the steps below..

## **Recommended Steps**

As of today you cannot change anything manually in the Edit Asset screen and have a subsequent run of the scan update your asset. However we are working on making it possible to update description, glossary term and classification, and have subsequent runs of a scan update your asset for new classifications it finds and other metadata. This is in the plan to be pushed out soon during the Public Preview.

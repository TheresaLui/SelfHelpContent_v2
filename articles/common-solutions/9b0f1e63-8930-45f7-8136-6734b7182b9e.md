# Configure Network Settings.

As you configure the network settings, review the following steps:

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Do one of the following:
   - If DHCP is enabled in your environment, network interfaces are automatically configured. An IP address, subnet, gateway, and DNS are automatically assigned.
   - If DHCP isn't enabled, you can assign static IPs, if needed.

   **Note:** You can configure your network interface as `IPv4`.

2. If you want to change from a static IP address to a DHCP address, wait until after the device has registered with the service, and then change it. 

3. To view the IPs of all the adapters, go to the Azure portal, and view the **Device properties** for your service.

**Note:** Azure Stack Edge devices do not support multi homing. Each port needs to be configured separately for the functions. 


## **Recommended Documents**

* [Details on Network settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy#configure-networke)
* [Enable Network Interface for Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy#enable-compute-network)

### Notes

We recommend that you not switch the local IP address of the network interface from static to DCHP, unless you have another IP address to connect to the device. If you use one network interface and switch to DHCP, there is no way to determine the DHCP address. If you want to change to a DHCP address, see step 2 in the preceding procedure.

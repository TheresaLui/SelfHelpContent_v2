# Configure Network Settings.

As you configure the network settings, keep in mind:

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If DHCP is enabled in your environment, network interfaces are automatically configured. An IP address, subnet, gateway, and DNS are automatically assigned.
2. If DHCP isn't enabled, you can assign static IPs if needed
3. You can configure your network interface as IPv4
4. If you want to change from a static ip address to a DHCP address, wait until after the device has registered with the service, and then change. You can then view the IPs of all the adapters in the Device properties in the Azure portal for your service

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Details on Network settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-deploy-connect-setup-activate)
* [Manage Network for Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-extend-compute-access-modules)

### Notes

* We recommend that you do not switch the local IP address of the network interface from static to DCHP, unless you have another IP address to connect to the device. If using one network interface and you switch to DHCP, there would be no way to determine the DHCP address. If you want to change to a DHCP address, wait until after the device has registered with the service, and then change. You can then view the IPs of all the adapters in the Device properties in the Azure portal for your service.

# Configure Network Settings.

As you configure the network settings, keep the following in mind:

## **Recommended Steps**

- If DHCP is enabled in your environment, network interfaces are automatically configured. An IP address, subnet, gateway, and DNS are automatically assigned.
- If DHCP isn't enabled, you can assign static IPs if needed.
- You can configure your network interface as `IPv4`.
- If you want to change from a static ip address to a DHCP address, wait until after the device has registered with the service, and then change. You can then view the IPs of all the adapters in the **Device properties** in the Azure portal for your service
- Note that Azure Stack Edge devices do not support multi homing and each port needs to be configured separately for the functions. 

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Details on Network settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy#configure-networke)
* [Enable Network Interface for Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-configure-network-compute-web-proxy#enable-compute-network)

### Notes

We recommend that you do not switch the local IP address of the network interface from static to DCHP, unless you have another IP address to connect to the device. If using one network interface and you switch to DHCP, there would be no way to determine the DHCP address. If you want to change to a DHCP address, wait until after the device has registered with the service, and then change. You can then view the IPs of all the adapters in the Device properties in the Azure portal for your service.

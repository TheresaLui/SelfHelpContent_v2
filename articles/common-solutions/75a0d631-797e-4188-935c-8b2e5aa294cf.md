# WVD Connection - Intermittent disconnect

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To diagnose issues, make sure that you've set up a Log Analytics workspace so that you can review diagnostics data:
* [Using Windows Virtual Desktop with ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics)
* [Using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/diagnostics-log-analytics-2019)

2. Verify that the agent is properly configured on your session host and is picking up a heartbeat from the Windows Virtual Desktop service:
* [Users keep getting disconnected from session hosts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/troubleshoot-agent#error-users-keep-getting-disconnected-from-session-hosts)

For common error scenarios, see the troubleshooting section in the table of contents of our documentation.

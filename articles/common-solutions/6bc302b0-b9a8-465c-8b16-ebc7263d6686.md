# Troubleshooting performance issue

When troubleshooting performance issues, refer to the copy status to better understand time spent from the source or destination.
* If the greatest amount of time was spent from the source, focus on the source from IR. This can point to either a source side issue or a connectivity issue between the IR and Source. For details, refer to [Performance troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance-troubleshooting).
* If you want to focus on the network between the IR and Source/Sink, check for any retranmission between the Integration Runtime and the Source/Sink.

## How to write high performance custom ADF Copy code

Most users are able to resolve issues regarding custom ADF copy code performance and intermittent errors by using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Instead of using **client.Factories.List()**, use  **client.Factories.Get()** by `dataFactoryName`.

2. Use **GET** with the Data Factory Name to reduce the number of list factories objects that are called

3. Use the [SQL Server Bulk Copy](https://docs.microsoft.comdotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/bulk-copy-operations-in-sql-server) method.

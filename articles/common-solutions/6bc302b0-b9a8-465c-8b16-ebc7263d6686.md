# Troubleshooting performance issue

Please refer to the copy status, you can understand the time spent from source or destination, if the most time spent from source, you need to focus on the source from IR, it can be either the source side issue or connectivity issue between Integration Runtime and Source. More detail, please refer to the document[Performance troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance-troubleshooting)

If you want to focus on the network related between the IR and Source/Sink, you can check any retranmission between the Integration Runtime and Source/Sink.

Most users are able to resolve isues regarding custom ADF copy code performance and intermittent errors by using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Instead of using **client.Factories.List()**, use  **client.Factories.Get()** by `dataFactoryName`.

2. Use **GET** with the Data Factory Name to reduce the number of list factories objects that are called.

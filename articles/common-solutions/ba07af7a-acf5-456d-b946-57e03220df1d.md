# Retry Policies for Connectivity 

One of the biggest concerns about reconnecting a device based on the Embedded C SDK is to know when is a good time to reconnect. The below are guidelines on how to setup the retry logic. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Set up a retry mechanism for using azure-sdk-for-c IoT

* Please refer to the guidelines for implementing a retry logic documented in the
[MQTT state machine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/docs/iot/mqtt_state_machine.md#retrying-operations)
* It is highly recommended to have the reconnection strategy based on the retry logic detailed in the documentation above
* Not having a controlled retry strategy may actually lead to increased delays or preventing the client from effectively reconnecting to the Azure IoT Hub (due to timing or throttling)
	
2. Tweak the retry logic frequency

According to the [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/docs/iot/mqtt_state_machine.md#retrying-operations), the following arguments control the frequency of the retry logic:
	
* min_retry_delay_msec = 1000;
* max_retry_delay_msec = 100000;
* max_random_msec = 5000;

Note that az_iot_retry_calc_delay(...) is based on an Exponential Backoff with Jitter strategy.

To make the retry attempts to be more sparse from the beginning, increase the value of `min_retry_delay_msec`. To reduce the maximum delay between attempts, decrease the value of `max_retry_delay_msec`. To increase the variability (jitter) between successive retry attempts, increase the value of `max_random_msec`.

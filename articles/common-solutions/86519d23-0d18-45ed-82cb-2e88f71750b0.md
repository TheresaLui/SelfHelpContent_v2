# Visual Studio subscription not recognized

## **Recommended Steps**

Why doesn't Azure DevOps recognize me as a Visual Studio subscriber?

* Azure DevOps should automatically recognize your subscription when you sign in using your primary or alternate identity. If this doesn't happen, try the following:
  * Check that you have an active Visual Studio subscription that includes [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-azure-devops#eligibility) as a benefit
  * Confirm that you're using a login/identity that is either the primary or alternate identity for your Visual Studio subscription
  * Visit the [Visual Studio subscriber](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o%7Emsft%7Edocs) portal at least once before you sign in to Azure DevOps

I’ve assigned a user the Visual Studio Subscription access level, but it reverts back to Stakeholder. Why?

*  Visual Studio subscribers are entitled to the Azure DevOps features as a subscriber benefit. Azure DevOps will automatically recognize a user’s VS subscription upon log-in. Assigning a user the Visual Studio Subscription access level doesn’t actually purchase a subscription for them; it’s merely a convenience feature for administrators. Therefore, if you assign the Visual Studio Subscriber access level to a user without an active subscription, their access level will revert back to Stakeholder automatically.

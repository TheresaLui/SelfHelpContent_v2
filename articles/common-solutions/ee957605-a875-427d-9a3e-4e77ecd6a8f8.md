# Private Link and Service Endpoint

Refer to the following limitations when setting up private links and Service Endpoints for App Service.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Setting up private links for App Service<br>
* Private endpoints can only be accessed from the VNET (and the connected network) in which the private endpoint is created.
* App Service is not available over its public endpoint. Trying to access App Service over its public endpoint will result in an "HTTP 403" message.
* Check the DNS resolution from the client that is accessing the App Service private endpoint. It must resolve to the private IP assigned from the private endpoint for the app to be accessible.
* Remote debugging is not currently available with Private Endpoints.
* Private Endpoints is not available for slots.

### Setting up Service Endpoints for App Service:<br>
* If remote debugging is performed from an Azure Virtual Machine, disable the **Microsoft.Web service** endpoint on the subnet corresponding to that Virtual Machine.

# How to author and develop using ADF

Azure Data Factory contains a series of interconnected systems that provide a complete end-to-end platform for data engineers.
 ADF offers several ways to author and develop pipelines and activities. You can use ADF Portal, PowerShell and SDKs. 
 Preferred method is use of Azure Portal Browser for visual experience of developing data pipelines wih no code in most cases.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. The Azure Data Factory user interface experience (UX) lets you visually author and deploy resources for your data factory without having to write any code. 
You can drag activities to a pipeline canvas, perform test runs, debug iteratively, and deploy and monitor your pipeline runs. 
Please follow [Author Visually](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/author-visually)
2. For iterative development debugging, please  follow [Iterative Development and Debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/iterative-development-debugging)
3. For managing pipeline artifcats, please follow [ADF Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/author-management-hub)
4. For source control, please follow [Source Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/source-control)
5. For publishing pipelines, please follow  [ADF Publishing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/continuous-integration-deployment-improvements)
6. For creating ADF pipelines using PowerShell, please follow [ADF Using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-powershell)
7. For creating ADF pipelines using .NET SDK, please follow [ADF using .NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net)
8. For creating ADF pipelines using ARM(Azure Resource Manager) templates, please follow [ADF using ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net)

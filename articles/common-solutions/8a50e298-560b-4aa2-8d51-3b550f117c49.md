# Author and Develop using ADF - How To

Azure Data Factory (ADF) contains a series of interconnected systems that provide a complete end-to-end platform for data engineers.
ADF offers several ways to author and develop pipelines and activities, including via ADF Portal, PowerShell and SDKs. 

We highly recommend using the ADF user interface experience, which lets you visually author and deploy resources for your data factory without having to write any code. You can drag activities to a pipeline canvas, perform test runs, debug iteratively, and deploy and monitor your pipeline runs. 

To learn more about ADF features, see the following section.

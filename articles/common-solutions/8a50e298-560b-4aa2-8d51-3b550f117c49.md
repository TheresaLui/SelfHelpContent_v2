# Author and Develop using ADF - How To

Azure Data Factory (ADF) contains a series of interconnected systems that provide a complete end-to-end platform for data engineers.
ADF offers several ways to author and develop pipelines and activities, including via ADF Portal, PowerShell and SDKs. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. The Azure Data Factory user interface experience (UX) lets you visually author and deploy resources for your data factory without having to write any code. 
You can drag activities to a pipeline canvas, perform test runs, debug iteratively, and deploy and monitor your pipeline runs. 
For details, read [Visual authoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/author-visually).

2. To learn about iterative development debugging in ADF, read [Iterative Development and Debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/iterative-development-debugging)

3. To learn how to manage pipeline artifacts in ADF, read [ADF Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/author-management-hub)
4. For details about source control in ADF, see [Source Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/source-control)
5. For publishing pipelines, see [ADF Publishing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/continuous-integration-deployment-improvements)
6. For creating ADF pipelines using PowerShell, see [ADF Using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-powershell)
7. For creating ADF pipelines using .NET SDK, see [ADF using .NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net)
8. For creating ADF pipelines using ARM(Azure Resource Manager) templates, see [ADF using ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net)



## **Recommended Documents**

* [Introduction to Azure Data Factory]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction )
* [ADF Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/)

### Notes

* Visual way of authoring and developing ADF pipelines is recommended.

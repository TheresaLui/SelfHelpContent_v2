# Unknown resource health issues 

Resolve Unknown resource health issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If the data factory has any new existing runs, the reported health status for the factory should not be **unknown**.
2. If unknown status is reported, update the factory from the Azure portal by [adding a temporary tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources#portal) as the first troubleshooting step.
3. After the factory update, the resource health status of the factory should update accordingly, based on success or failure percentage of runs in factory.

# Azure Sentinel - Threat Intelligence Data Connectors - Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)

## **Recommended Steps**

If you never received data, or haven't received data since reeeiving it during the initial connection, complete the following steps:
1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Sentinel service.   
2. Choose the workspace where you have imported threat indicators using the TAXII Data Connector.  
3. Navigate to the **Data Connectors** section under the **Configuration** pane.  
4. Open the **Threat Intelligence - TAXII (Preview)** data connector.  
5. Check the last indicator received time on the table for TAXII Servers connected. You can also validate this in the **Graph** on the left pane of the **Connectors** page. 
		
6. If you see that there are no indicators in the past x hours, verify if any new indicators exist in the collection after the last import time. <br>
     *  You can do this by checking the TAXII server collection using a `CURL` command. <br>
	The API root is: https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds (This is just an example)<br>
     * You can always run a quick check from a command line to see what indicators are in the collection (to see if there are any new ones for example):<br>
	 **Collection id:** 135 or 136 or 107 <br>
	 **Username:** guest <br>
	 **Password:** guest <br>
	 
	    ```
	    curl -u guest https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/collections/107/objects/ 
	    curl -u guest https://limo.anomali.com/api/v1/taxii2/feeds/collections/{{collectionid}}/objects/ 
	    ```

	After doing this, open the file and determine the last time there was an update.

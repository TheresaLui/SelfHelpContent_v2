# Creating a full Managed HSM Backup

Resource type Managed HSM supports backing up the entire contents of the HSM. This includes all keys, versions, attributes, tags, and role assignments. 
For Key vault, you'll need to back up keys, secrets, and certificates individually. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Backup is a data plane operation. The caller initiating the backup operation must have permission to perform dataAction `Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/backup/start/action`. You can follow these [how-to steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/backup-restore).

2. Only the following built-in roles have permission to perform full backup:
    * Managed HSM Administrator
    * Managed HSM Backup

3. You must provide following information to execute a full backup:
    * HSM name or URL
    * Storage account name
    * Storage account blob storage container
    * Storage container SAS token with permissions

4. While the backup is in progress, the HSM may not operate at full throughput. Some HSM partitions will be busy performing the backup operation.

5. Backup and Restore are both long running operations but will immediately return a Job ID

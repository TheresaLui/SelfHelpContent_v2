## **Recommended Steps**

### **Cannot add a dataset**

If you cannot add a dataset, try to resolve the issue by following these steps:

   1. Ensure you have permission to write to the Azure Data Explorer cluster, which is located in *Microsoft.Kusto/clusters/write*. This permission exists in the **Contributor** role.
   1. If this is the first time you're sharing data from this Azure Data Explorer cluster through this Azure Data Share resource, ensure you have permission to add role assignments to the Azure Data Explorer cluster, which is located in *Microsoft.Authorization/roleassignments/write*. This permission exists in the **Owner** role. Azure Data Share uses this permission to grant the Data Share resource's managed identity *Contributor* permission to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.

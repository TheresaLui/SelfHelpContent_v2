# Mapping data flow - Sink Format and Connector Issue Common Solutions

## Common Solutions
Resolve common scenarios with Dataflow sources using the following troubleshooting steps.

### Connection and authentication issues

*SQL Server*
    1. Master Key error

        _**Cause**_: Master key does not exist in the database.

        _**Recommendation**_: Create a master key in the SQL server.

    2. Public access error 

        _**Cause**_: Public access for azure services are not allowed in the firewall section of SQL Server in the Azure portal

        _**Recommendation**_: Make sure public access to azure services is enabled in the Azure portal

*Storage accounts*
    1. Storage account is in a private network

        _**Recommendations**_:

        - Create an Azure Integration Runtime (IR) within Azure Data Factory Managed Virtual Network (VNET) and leverage the ADLS gen2 private endpoint. Refer to [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/managed-virtual-network-private-endpoint) for instructions.
            
        - Enable 'Allow Trusted Servicesâ€¦' in the storage account and use Azure IR. Refer to the article [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-factory/data-factory-is-now-a-trusted-service-in-azure-storage-and-azure/ba-p/964993) to see how to do this.

        - Create Azure IR in a specific region different from the Storage account and whitelist Azure IR IPs for that region in the storage account. It is recommended to use a service tag for the specific region, because the IP ranges may change. Refer to the article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/azure-integration-runtime-ip-addresses) for IP address and setup information.
       
    2. Error "403 Forbidden"

        _**Cause**_: 403 Forbidden since the container/folder level permissions are not set.

        _**Recommendation**_: Make sure the right permissions are set for the authentication method used in the linked service for the container/folder that will be accessed using DataFlow.

### **Sink connector issues

1. Error "Row handling not executing" pre or post SQL, or truncate table writes to Sink
    
    _**Recommendation**_: Debug preview doesn't write to sinks, so error row handling won't be reflected in the preview. For testing, use Debug runs instead.

2. New columns are not being created in the sink even when **schema dri** is enabled.

    _**Cause**_: This is by design and isn't currently supported in Data Flow.
    
    _**Recommendation**_: Make sure the schema of the sink table contains the required column unless the sink will be creating a new table

3. Performance issues while writing data in the sink
    
    _**Cause**_: Single partition is chosen in the **Optimize** tab of the sink.
    
    **_Recommendations_**:
    1. Use current partitioning instead
    2. If you choose custom partitioning, refer to the performance tuning guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-performance)

### **FAQ**

**My connection to Azure Synapse Analytics (Formerly Azure Data Warehouse) works when I test connectivity, but fails when attempting to write data with a permissions error. What are the permissions required?**

To use PolyBase, the user loading data into SQL Data Warehouse must have the `CONTROL` permission on the target database. For more information, see the connector documentation.

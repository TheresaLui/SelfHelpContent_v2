# Configuring with Azure Active Directory or Office 365

## Common issues and questions about Azure Active Directory (AD) and Office 365

### Where can I find some general information on how Azure AD integration works with Azure DevOps?
Start with [About accessing your organization via Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/access-with-azure-ad?view=azure-devops)

### After connecting to Azure AD, some users are disconnected, but they have matching identities in Azure AD.
[This document explains what to do in this scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-some-users-are-disconnected-but-they-have-matching-identities-in-azure-ad-what-should-i-do)

### I have less than 200 users in my organization. Do I need to contact support before connecting to Azure AD?
Probably not! You will have an opportunity to resolve any user mapping issues during the connection process. If youâ€™ve tried to resolve the mapping issues yourself, but are still seeing issues, you should continue contacting support.

### I have more than 200 users in my organization. Can I connect to Azure AD?
You can still connect on your own, but you should continue contacting support for help with disconnected users

### Why are no identities found when I try to add users from Azure AD to my Azure DevOps Organization? 
Are you an Azure AD guest user? [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-why-are-no-identities-found-when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization).<br>

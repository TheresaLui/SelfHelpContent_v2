# Configuring with Azure Active Directory or Office 365

## **Recommended Steps**

* Where can I find some general information on how Azure AD integration works with Azure DevOps?
    *   Start with [About accessing your organization via Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/access-with-azure-ad?view=azure-devops)
* After connecting to Azure AD some users are disconnected, but they have matching identities in Azure AD. [What should I do?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-some-users-are-disconnected-but-they-have-matching-identities-in-azure-ad-what-should-i-do)
* I have less than 200 users in my organization. Do I need to contact support before connecting to Azure AD?
    *   Probably not! You will have an opportunity to resolve any user mapping issues during the connection process. If you’ve tried to resolve the mapping issues yourself, but are still seeing issues, you should continue contacting support
* I have more than 200 users in my organization. Can I connect to Azure AD?
    *   You can still connect on your own, but you should continue contacting support for help with disconnected users
* Why are there no identities found when I try to add users from Azure AD to my Azure DevOps Organization? 
    *   Are you an Azure AD guest user? [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-azure-access?view=azure-devops#q-why-are-no-identities-found-when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization).

# Issues in creating configuration (GitOps) on Arc enabled Kubernetes

Unable to create configurations on Arc enabled Kubernetes cluster and get the GitOps workflow set up.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure that you have `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/Write` permission on the Arc enabled Kubernetes resource on which this configuration is being created
2. Run the following command and check that all agents are in a `Running` state: `kubectl get pods -n azure-arc`
3. Run the following command to ensure that all pods in the operator namespace are in a `Running` state: `kubectl get pods -n <operator-namespace>`
4. From the output of running above commands, if you find any pod stuck in a `Pending` state, this could be because your cluster doesn't have enough resources for scheduling these pods. [Scale up the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#resizing-a-cluster) to get these pods running.
5. If you want to deploy configurations across all namespaces of the cluster, ensure that you have chosen the scope as `cluster` when creating the configuration
6. If using a private Git repository, configure the [public key with your Git provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/use-gitops-connected-cluster#apply-configuration-from-a-private-git-repository)

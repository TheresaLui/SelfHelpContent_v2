# Issues in creating configuration (GitOps) on Arc enabled Kubernetes

If you're unable to create configurations on Arc enabled Kubernetes cluster and get the GitOps workflow set up, review the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure that you have `Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/Write` permission on the Arc enabled Kubernetes resource on which this configuration is being created
2. Run the following command and check that all agents are in a `Running` state: `kubectl get pods -n azure-arc`
3. Run the following command to ensure that all pods in the operator namespace are in a `Running` state: `kubectl get pods -n <operator-namespace>`
4. From the output of running above commands, if you find any pod stuck in a `Pending` state, this could be because your cluster doesn't have enough resources for scheduling these pods. [Scale up the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) to get these pods running.
5. If you want to deploy configurations across all namespaces of the cluster, ensure that you have chosen the scope as `cluster` when creating the configuration
6. If using a private Git repository, configure the [public key with your Git provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/use-gitops-connected-cluster#apply-configuration-from-a-private-git-repository)

# Order Tracking

If you have already placed the order for the device, our operations team will reach out to you for the confirmation of basic details like address, device configuration, etc.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you have already received such an email, respond to the same team (adbeops@microsoft.com) for an update on the status of your order
2. Currently we do not provide live tracking of the order, since each order is handled independently by our team

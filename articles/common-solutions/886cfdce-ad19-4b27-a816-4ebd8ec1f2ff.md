### **Do I need to pay for Azure Migrate and the non-Microsoft/ISV tools that I plan to use?**

Azure Migrate - Server Assessment and Server Migration tools are available at no additional charge. However, you may incur charges for other non-Microsoft/ISV assessment and migration tools you use while using Azure Migrate. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118712).

### **I want to create a new project in a different geography and add tools to it**  
  
If you need to specify a different geography to store discovery, assessment or migration related metadata (typically used for scenarios where your data centers are present in different geographies), go to **Servers** or **Databases** and click **Change** against the **Migrate project (Change)** on the upper right corner of your screen. Then click **Click here** to create a new Azure Migrate project. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118620).

### **My added tools don't show up in the Servers or Databases or VDI pages**

Ensure you have selected the right project by clicking **Change** against **Migrate project (Change)** on the upper right corner of your screen in **Servers** or **Databases**. Now choose the correct subscription and project name and click **OK**. The page should refresh with the added tools of the selected Azure Migrate project. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/create-manage-projects#find-a-project).
  
### **I don't see the tool that I want to use**
  
We are constantly adding tools to Azure Migrate. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118711).

### **ISV tools that are available in other geographies are not listed in Azure Government**

ISV partners are in process of enabling their tools in Azure Government for Azure Migrate. Meanwhile, either you can use the partner tool independently or use any of the listed tools.

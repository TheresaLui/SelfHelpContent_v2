# SAP Cloud Platform Custom Domain

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below

## **Recommended Steps**

- The CF CLI commands for custom domain certificate management are not found may due to the plugin was not installed: Get latest plugin version from [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud).
- The plugin commands do not behave as documented may due to the plugin is outdated: Get latest plugin version from [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud).
- There is no Custom Domain service in the CF space marketplace due to the entitlement association is missing: Distribute existing quota over the Subaccounts as needed.
- Creating the CF private domain fails due to a custom domain is already reserved by the same or some other organization or account in the same landscape, it is not possible to create a subdomain on top of it. If the custom domain is owned by the same organization but another space, any subdomain must be created there.
- Activation seems to fail due to any changes of the load balancer which would require a deployment cycle and is triggered once per hour, it may take longer if the deployment pipeline is busy: Please wait couple hours.
- The custom domain URL shows an error in the browser due to activation is not completed yet, and the standard certificate does not fit or the certificate is expired: Please follow the document to [update certificate](https://help.sap.com/viewer/74af813c7ee2457cb5eddca0cc70a0c1/Cloud/en-US/721233b8efcf401094778a78f1bf2a66.html).
- The custom domain key and certificate disappeared, any custom domain configurations for the respective CF organization are removed automatically: Please start from scratch.

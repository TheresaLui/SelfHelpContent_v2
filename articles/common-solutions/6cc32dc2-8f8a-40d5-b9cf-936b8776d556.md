# I'm having a problem with activity policies

Most users are able to resolve activity policy questions using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you have a user who is repeatedly being asked to sign in:

	Check if you have a policy with a governance action set to require the user to sign in again. If the user is repeatedly matching a policy condition, a Cloud App Security administrator can resolve the issue by modifying the policy to exclude the user.

1. If you're unable to suspend a user:

	Check if your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is set to automatically sync with users in your Active Directory on-premises environment. If so, be aware that the governance action will be reverted/overridden by the sync.

# Web Proxy

On the Web proxy settings page, do the following:

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the Web proxy URL box, enter the URL in this format: http://host-IP address or FQDN:Port number. HTTPS URLs are not supported.
2. Under Authentication, select None or NTLM. If you enable compute and use IoT Edge module on your Azure Stack Edge device, we recommend you set web proxy authentication to None. NTLM is not supported.
3. If you're using authentication, enter a username and password
4. To validate and apply the configured web proxy settings, select Apply settings

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Details for WebProxy Setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-deploy-connect-setup-activate)

### Notes

* Proxy-auto config (PAC) files are not supported
* A PAC file defines how web browsers and other user agents can automatically choose the appropriate proxy server (access method) for fetching a given URL
* Proxies that try to intercept and read all the traffic (then re-sign everything with their own certification) aren't compatible since the proxy's cert is not trusted. Typically transparent proxies work well with Azure Stack Edge.

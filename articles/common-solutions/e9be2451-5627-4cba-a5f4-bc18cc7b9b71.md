# Unexpected Disconnects.

Most users are able to resolve their unexpected disconnect issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure the device isn't accidentally disabled in [IoT Devices tab](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.DeviceExplorerBlade.id.$resourceId)
2. For the most reliable connectivity, try using the latest version of our [device client SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks#azure-iot-hub-device-sdks), if possible
3. Get the error code(s) (400xxx, 500xxx) from diagnostic logs and refer to the corresponding device disconnection troubleshooting guide, as follows:

    * [404104 DeviceConnectionClosedRemotely](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-404104-deviceconnectionclosedremotely)
    * [401003 IoTHubUnauthorized](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-401003-iothubunauthorized)
    * [409002 LinkCreationConflict](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-409002-linkcreationconflict)
    * [500xxx Internal errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-500xxx-internal-errors)
    * [500008 GenericTimeout](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-troubleshoot-error-500xxx-internal-errors)

4. If you have access to the device either physically or remotely (like SSH), see if you can get the logs from the device to find out more. These logs will also help our support team troubleshoot the issue.
5. Make sure to collect logs to help us diagnose the issue

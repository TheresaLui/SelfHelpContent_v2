# Setting up role-based access control (RBAC)

An Azure Machine Learning workspace is an Azure resource. Like other Azure resources, when a new Azure Machine Learning workspace is created, it comes with three default roles that can be assigned to users:

1. **Reader**: Read-only actions in the workspace. Readers can list and view assets in a workspace, but can't create or update these assets.
2. **Contributor**: View, create, edit, or delete assets (where applicable) in a workspace. For example, contributors can create an experiment, create or attach a compute cluster, submit a run, and deploy a web service.
3. **Owner**: Full access to the workspace, including the ability to view, create, edit, or delete assets (where applicable) in a workspace. Additionally, you can change role assignments.

When changing role assignments, it may take up to 30 minutes for them to take effect, because application caches are used to improve performance.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Create custom roles**

If the built-in roles are insufficient, you can define custom roles. See the following example of role definition for a data scientist role, which can be used to prevent a user from creating compute resources:

```
{
    "Name": "Data Scientist Custom",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Can run experiment but can't create or delete compute.",
    "Actions": ["*"],
    "NotActions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/delete", 
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/write"
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace_name>"
    ]
}
```

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) about how to create and assign custom roles.

### **Configure access on individual resources**

Instance-level access (allowing the user to access datasetA, but not datasetB) is not yet supported in Azure ML. For instance-level access, we recommend separating resources into different workspaces and using custom roles to control access.

# ASE Deletion


## **Recommended Steps**

* If the ASE is marked as unhealthy you will not be able to delete it. An unhealthy ASE is most likely because the Azure platform cannot communicate with the ASE. Removing all UDRs and NSG from the ASE should return the ASE to a healthy state and allow you to delete it.

* If the ASE is healthy, please confirm that there are no App Service Plans or Web Apps associated with the ASE and that there are no locks on the vnet/subnet associated with the ASE. If there are App Service Plans and/or Web Apps still associated to the ASE it won't allow deletion.

# Upload Logs and view Telemetry

Most users are able to resolve their issues with resources view related telemetry for a SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc using the recommended documents below.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Upload Logs to Azure Monitor

This will export all relevant logs from MI-AA to the specified file:

   ```bash
   azdata arc dc export -t logs -path logs.json
   ```

This will upload logs to a Azure monitor log analytics workspace:

   ```bash
   azdata arc dc upload --path logs.json

   ```

## View your logs in Azure Portal

Once your logs are uploaded, you should be able to query them using the log query explorer as follows:

1. Open the Azure Portal and then search for your workspace by name in the search  bar at the top and then select it
1. Click Logs in the left panel
1. Click Get Started (or click the links on the Getting Started page) to learn more about Log Analytics if you are new to it)
1. Follow the tutorial to learn more about Log Analytics if is is your first time using the technology
1. Expand Custom Logs at the bottom of the list of tables and you will see a table called 'sql_instance_logs_CL'.
1. Click the 'eye' icon next to the table name
1. Click the 'View in query editor' button
1. You'll now have a query in the query editor which will show the most recent 10 events in the log
1. From here, you can experiment with querying the logs using the query editor, set alerts, etc.

### Troubleshooting Steps

If you have any failures, you can view the azdata log by issuing a command like this.

   ```bash
   cat azdata.log |grep -v "DEBUG"| tail -n 500
   ```

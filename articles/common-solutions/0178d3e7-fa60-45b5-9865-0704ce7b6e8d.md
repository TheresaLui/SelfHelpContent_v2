# Data from private AKS cluster isn't shown 

## **Recommended Steps**

If missing data is live data: AKS clusters enabled as private clusters are not supported with this feature. This feature relies on directly accessing the Kubernetes API through a proxy server from your browser. Enabling networking security to block the Kubernetes API from this proxy will block this traffic. 

The AKS team is currently working on supporting private clusters. In the future, live metrics will be supported for private clusters.

# Signing up for an Azure DevOps organization

Most users can resolve issues regarding Azure DevOps organizations by following the steps below.

### **Recommended Steps**

* To create a new Azure DevOps organization, see [Create an organization or project collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops)

* To learn about the basic administrative concepts (organizations, projects, access levels, permissions, and so on), see [About organization management in Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/organization-management?view=azure-devops)

* To learn best practices for planning and scaling my Azure DevOps organization, see [plan your organizational structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure?view=azure-devops). This whitepaper discusses the different organizational structures, the pros and cons of each structure, and best practices for each.

* To reset your Azure DevOps organization, or reuse your current organization name for a new organization, see [rename your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/rename-organization?view=azure-devops). After the organization name that you want is free, [create a brand new organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops) with the same name.

### Troubleshooting Connectivity

1. Sign out of your browser. To do so, select the [Visual Studio sign-out link](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signout) and let the sign-out process complete 
2. Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press Ctrl+Shift+Del 
3. Open Internet Explorer and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies. 
4. Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE
5. Use a private browser session to retry the connection by directly going to the link dev.azure.com/<your organization name> 
6. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and then add it again

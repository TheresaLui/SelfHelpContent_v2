# Compliance Certification in the Azure Bot Service

Azure Bot Service is a global Azure service and therefore is available to customers in all regions in the clouds where it is deployed, including:
Azure public cloud, which is available globally. Azure Government is available in four regions in the United States to US government agencies and their partners. To help customers meet their own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide, Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry in terms of both breadth (total number of offerings) and depth (number of customer-facing services in assessment scope). 
## **Recommended Steps**

Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments - globally applicable, US Government, industry specific, and region or country/region specific. Compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments, and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft.

# Azure Sentinel - Data collection - Connectors based on Agents, OMS and MMA

Resolve issues with data collection in Azure Sentinel by following these steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Make sure to follow the prerequisites and configuration steps described in the relevant connector page.

2. If you're having an issue receiving events, make sure that your server is connected to the Azure Sentinel Workspace by checking the Heartbeat.
   Run the following query:
      
      ```
       Heartbeat<br>
       | where TimeGenerated >= 1h
       | where Computer == "[Computer name]"
       | take 10
       
      ```

3. To monitor [Data collection Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/monitor-data-connector-health), go to the **Agent Info** tab, select one of the following:
    - To view only Azure Arc-managed machines, select the **Azure-managed machines** tab
    - To view both managed and non-Azure machines with the Log Analytics agent installed, select the **All machines** tab<br>
 
       Search your required machine in the **Machine name** filter.

3. Configure **Security Events collection** within the context of a single workspace from Azure Security Center or from Azure Sentinel, but not from both. If you are onboarding Azure Sentinel in a workspace that is already receiving Azure Defender alerts from Azure Security Center and is set to collect Security Events, follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-windows-security-events).

4. Windows Firewall: [Validate connectivity or troubleshoot delay on the first connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-windows-firewall#enable-the-connector)
              
5. CEF based connector:
   1. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your designated Linux machine
   2. You must have python 2.7 or 3 installed on the Linux machine. Use the python `-version` command to check.
   3. The Linux machine must not be connected to any Azure workspaces before you install the Log Analytics agent
   4. Your Linux machine must have a minimum of 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM
   5. A single log forwarder machine using the `rsyslog` daemon has a supported capacity of up to 8500 events per second (EPS) collected
   6. To deploy the log forwarder, use the [installation script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-agent?tabs=rsyslog)
   7. [Configure your security solution to send CEF messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-solution-config)
   8. To validate connectivity, use the [troubleshooting script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-verify?tabs=rsyslog)
              
6. AWS CloudTrails latency issue: AWS CloudTrail has built-in limitations in its LookupEvents API. It allows no more than two transactions per second (TPS) per account. Each query can return a maximum of 50 records. Consequently, if a single tenant constantly generates more than 100 records per second in one region, backlogs and delays in data ingestion will result.

9. To use the same machine to forward both plain Syslog and CEF messages, [configure the `Rsyslog` and disable the auto-sync with the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-syslog).

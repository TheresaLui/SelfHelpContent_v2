# Error: "QnA runtime error - Azure search max index limit reached error"

Attempting to publish more than two knowledge bases (KBs) on the Free tier of Azure Search can result in the error "QnA runtime error - Azure search max index limit reached". 
To resolve this error, upgrade the Azure Search pricing tier.

This error can occur even though you've upgraded the QnA pricing tiers. When you create a QnA resource for the first time, Azure creates additional resources for the QnA service to run properly. Among those resources is an Azure Search resource, which must be upgraded to host more KBs.
 If you plan to have many knowledge bases, upgrade your Azure Cognitive Search service pricing tier.

At this time, the Azure Search SKU doesn't support in-place upgrades. The following procedure explains how to upgrade by creating a new Azure Search resource with the desired SKU, restoring the data to the new resource, and then linking it to the QnA Maker stack. 

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Create a new Azure Search resource in the Azure portal, and select the desired SKU.

2. Restore the indexes from your original Azure Search resource to the new one. See the [backup restore sample code](https://github.com/pchoudhari/QnAMakerBackupRestore).

3. After the data is restored, go to your new Azure Search resource, select **Keys**, and write down the **Name** and the **Admin key**.

4. To link the new Azure Search resource to the QnA Maker stack, go to the QnA Maker App Service instance.

5. Select **Application settings** and modify the settings in the **AzureSearchName** and **AzureSearchAdminKey** fields from step 3.

6. Restart the App Service instance.

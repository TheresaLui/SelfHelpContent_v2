# Device Update device tagging self-help

It looks like you're having issues with tagging devices in Device Update. Most users are able to resolve their tagging issue using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Navigate to the IoT Hub associated with your Device Update instance and verify that your device is registered.
2. Verify that your desired tag value does not exceed 255 characters.
3. Verify that your desired tag value contains only alphanumeric characters and the following special characters: period (.), hyphen (-), underscore ( _ ), tilde (~).
4. Verify that the device you are trying to tag does not already belong to a group (one device can only belong to one group).
5. Check the [Device Update troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/troubleshoot-device-update) to see if your issue is addressed. If you're still encountering issues, create a new support request.

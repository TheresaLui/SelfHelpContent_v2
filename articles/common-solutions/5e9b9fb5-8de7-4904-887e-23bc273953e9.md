# Database mail  

Most customers are able to resolve their issues with database mail using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* **Recommended method of sending email**
   - Use authenticated SMTP relay services to send email from Azure VMs or from Azure App Service 
   - These relay services typically connect through TCP port 587, but they support other ports
   - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/partners/azure/) is one such SMTP relay service, but there are others
   - You might also have a secure SMTP relay service running on-premises that you can use

* **Troubleshooting database mail issues**

   - Check if the **Database Mail XPs** option enabled in the **sys.configurations** view. If not, enable it using the following script:

       ```
       sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
       GO  
       RECONFIGURE;  
       GO  
       sp_configure 'Database Mail XPs', 1;  
       GO  
       RECONFIGURE  
       GO
       ```
  
   - Check that you have **correctly configured an email profile** with a correct email server name/IP address, port and account information (username and password)
       - Check if you can **reach the mail server** from SQL VM
       - Check in the Network Security Group associated to the subnet where your database mail server is placed whether you have inbound rule that allows communication through **TCP port 25**
       - Check in the Network Security Group associated to the SQL VM subnet whether you have an outbound rule that allows communication through **TCP port 25**
       - Make sure that subnet range where your SQL VM is placed is configured as **allowed sender** in your target mail server 
       - If you're using a custom DNS for the mail server, make sure that you update Azure DNS with the DNS record of the mail server
       - Create a SQL Agent job that has one PowerShell task that executes a command like `tns smtp.sendgrid.net -25`. Run the job and check the job output in the job history. 
       - Replace the name of the mail server and/or port in the job with the mail server and port that you're using, and repeat the previous step.
  - Check that you have **enabled the port** used to communicate with the email server. The port should be added in the [Outbound security rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic#create-security-rules).
  - **Check the status of email messages** sent with database mail in the Database Mail Log, `msdb.dbo.sysmail_event_log`, and `msdb.dbo.sysmail_faileditems`.

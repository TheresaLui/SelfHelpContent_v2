# Issue with sending metrics using REST API

Most users are able to resolve issues about sending metrics using the REST API by using the following steps.
 
## **Recommended Steps**

1.	See [metrics store custom REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-store-custom-rest-api) to ensure you are sending custom metrics properly.
2.	If the `curl` command failed, make sure you are entering the proper tenant id, client id, and client secret.
3.	If the preceding step does not work, make sure that your client secret is not expired. To check the expiration date, go to Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Certificates & Secrets. If it has expired, you must create a new client secret and apply changes to the `curl` command.
4.	If problem persists, file a support ticket.

# When you submit your first job you get a ‘forbidden’ error code.

When you submit your first job you may get a "forbidden error" code. 

This issue may happen during a workspace creation when Azure Quantum fails to complete the role assignment to link the new workspace to the storage account that was specified. 
A typical scenario for this situation happens if the tab or web browser window is closed before the workspace creation is completed. 

## **Recommended Steps**

You can verify that you are running into this role assignment issue by following these steps: 

- Navigate to your new quantum workspace in Azure Portal
- Under Overview > Essentials > Storage account, click on the storage account link 
- In the left navigation bar, select Access Control (IAM) 
- Select Role Assignments 
- Verify that your workspace appears as a Contributor 
- If the workspace does not appear as a Contributor you can either: 
  - Create a new workspace and make sure to wait for the workspace creation to be completed before closing the web browser tab or window. 
  - Add the proper role assignment under the storage account 
    - Access Control (IAM) > Add role assignments 
    - Role > Contributor 
    - Assign access to > User, group, or service principal 
    - Select > [Workspace name] 
    - Save

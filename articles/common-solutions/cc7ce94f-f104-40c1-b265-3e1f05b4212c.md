# When you submit your first job you get a ‘forbidden’ error code.

When you submit your first job you may get a "forbidden error" code. 

This issue can happen during a workspace creation if Azure Quantum fails to complete the role assignment to link the new workspace to the storage account that was specified. 
A typical scenario for this situation happens if the tab or web browser window is closed before the workspace creation is completed. 

## **Recommended Steps**

To confirm that you're experiencing this role assignment issue, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to your new quantum workspace in the Azure portal
2. Under **Overview** > **Essentials** > **Storage** account, select the storage account link 
3. In the left navigation bar, select **Access Control (IAM)**
4. Select **Role Assignments**
5. Verify that your workspace appears as a Contributor. 
6. If the workspace doesn't appear as a Contributor, do either of the following: 
  - Create a new workspace, and make sure to wait for the workspace creation to be completed before closing the web browser tab or window. 
  - Add the proper role assignment under the storage account: 
   <br>a. **Access Control (IAM)** > **Add role assignments** 
   <br>b. **Role** > **Contributor** 
   <br>c. Assign access to > User, group, or service principal 
   <br>d. Select > [**Workspace name**] 
   <br>e. Save

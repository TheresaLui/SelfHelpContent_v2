# This is the title of the article. It is not displayed in the portal but is a required part of every article.

This is a brief paragraph about the problem.  It can be as simple as "Most users are able to resolve their [topic] issue using the steps below", or a more detailed outline of the issue being experienced.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. This is a step with a link to an [external article](https://waal.co.il)


## **Recommended Documents**

* [aaaaaaa](https://gmail.com)
* [This is the display text for the last article in the list](http://)

### Notes

* The **Recommended Steps** and **Recommended Documents** headings must be entered as shown above (bolded H2)
* Formatting is not identical to Microsoft Docs - tables do not work, nor [!NOTE] tags
* Your Recommended Steps should be actual steps, not just links to other articles
* Ensure all links to Microsoft docs are non-region-specific, i.e. does not include /en-us/. This does not apply to articles for Mooncake.
* Don't link to internal review documentation - these URLs always start with "review.microsoft.docs", and users are unable to access them
* Do not use aka.ms links
* Copy the raw form of this article to use as a template for your own Common Solution article. Be sure to fill in the metadata!

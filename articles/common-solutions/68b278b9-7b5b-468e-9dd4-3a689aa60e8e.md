# Issues with device-to-cloud messages

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If all of your messages are timing out, go to [Overview](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.IotHubOverviewBlade.id.$resourceId) and make sure you're still under your daily limit
2. Check if you're hitting the throttle limit by comparing your [telemetry message send attempts metric](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring.MetricsBladeV3.ResourceId.$resourceId) against our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling)
3. Consider [scaling up your IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-scaling) if you're running into quota or throttling limits
4. If you have access to the device, try running the [diagnostic tool](https://github.com/Azure/iothub-diagnostics) on it to check connectivity issues
5. Make sure to collect logs so we can better help you diagnose the issue.

**Where are my 429 errors?**

If you're running tests and wondering why IoT Hub isn't returning any 429 errors for throttling, it's because IoT Hub returns `429 ThrottlingException` only after the limit is violated for too long. We do this so that your messages aren't dropped if you get burst traffic. In the meantime, IoT Hub processes the messages at the operation throttle rate, which might be slow if there's too much traffic in the backlog. To learn more, see [IoT Hub traffic shaping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling#traffic-shaping).

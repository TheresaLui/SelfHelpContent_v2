# How do I configure routing for a specific purpose

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To check the health status of your endpoint, go to **Custom endpoints** in [Message routing](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.RoutingBlade.resourceId.$resourceId)
2. To see the traffic, latency, and if messages have been dropped or orphaned, go to [Metrics](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring.MetricsBladeV3.ResourceId.$resourceId). For example:
   * Use **Routing: telemetry messages dropped** to see number of messages dropped due to dead endpoints
   * Use **Routing: telemetry messages orphaned** to see number of messages that didn't match any routing rules, including the fallback route
   * Use **Routing: message latency for Event Hub** to see the latency for routing to Event Hub endpoints

3. [Turn on logs for routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitor-resource-health) to see if rules evaluate to "undefined," if there are any errors from an endpoint, and so on.

**Not receiving any messages?**

Your messages might be getting lost due to the fallback route being disabled. Try **Enable** the fallback route in [Message routing](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_IotHub.RoutingBlade.resourceId.$resourceId).

**Having trouble applying query on the message body?**

If you think IoT Hub isn't evaluating the query expression on message body, make sure that `contentType` is set as application/JSON and `contentEncoding` is set as UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 in the [system properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-routing-query-syntax#system-properties).

**Body of JSON unreadable when routing to storage?**

When routing to storage with JSON encoding format, you must set the `contentType` to application/JSON and `contentEncoding` to UTF-8 in the message system properties. If this is not set, then IoT Hub writes the message in base 64 encoded format.

4. Make sure to collect logs so we can better help you diagnose the issue.

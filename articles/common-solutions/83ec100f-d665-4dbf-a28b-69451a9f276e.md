# Troubleshoot TLS Inspection

To use the Azure Firewall TLS inspection capability, you need to provide a valid intermediate CA certificate and deposit it in the Azure Key vault. 
Make sure that your CA certificate complies with the following requirements: 
- Password is less than PFX (Pkcs12) with a certificate and a private key 
- Certificate is a single certificate and does not include the entire chain of certificates  
- Certificate is valid for 1 year
- Certificate has an RSA private key with a minimal size of 4096 bytes 
- Certificate has the `KeyUsage` extension marked as **Critical** with the `KeyCertSign` flag (RFC 5280; 4.2.1.3 Key Usage) 
- Certificate has `BasicContraints` extension marked as **Critical** (RFC 5280; 4.2.1.9 Basic Constraints) 
- CA flag is set to `TRUE` 
- `Path Length` is greater than or equal to 1 

If your CA certificate is valid, but you canâ€™t access FQDNs or URLs under TLS inspection, check the following:  
- Web Server certificate is valid 
- Root CA certificate is installed on client OS 
- Browser or HTTPS client contains a valid root certificate. Some browsers have special certification policies. For example, see [setting certificate authorities for Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox). 
- URL destination type in your application rule covers the correct path and any other hyperlinks embedded in the destination HTML page. You can use wildcards for easy coverage of the full required URL path.

# VM creation fails: No more connections can be made to the service

Error creating a new virtual machine: There was a failure configuring the virtual machine role for 'vmname'. Job failed. Error opening "vmname" clustered roles. The service being accessed is licensed for a particular number of connections. No more connections can be made to the service at this time because there are already as many connections as the service can accept.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Azure Stack HCI needs to periodically connect to the Azure public cloud. If outbound connectivity is restricted by your external corporate firewall or proxy server, they must be configured to allow outbound access to port 443 (HTTPS) on a limited number of well-known Azure IPs. For information on how to prepare your firewalls, see [Configure firewalls for Azure Stack HCI](https://https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/concepts/configure-firewalls)
2. Install the required cmdlets on your management PC by running `Install-Module -Name Az.StackHCI` PowerShell cmdlet. If you are registering a cluster deployed from the current General Availability (GA) image of Azure Stack HCI, simply run the following command. If your cluster was deployed from the Public Preview image, make sure you have applied the November 23, 2020 Preview Update (KB4586852) or later to each server in the cluster before attempting to register with Azure.
    * You may see a prompt such as "Do you want PowerShellGet to install and import the NuGet provider now?" to which you should answer Yes (Y).
    * You may further be prompted "Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?" to which you should answer Yes (Y).
3. Perform the registration using the name of any server in the cluster. To get your Azure subscription ID, visit portal.azure.com, navigate to Subscriptions, and copy/paste your ID from the list.
    *`Register-AzStackHCI  -SubscriptionId "<subscription_ID>" -ComputerName Server1 [â€“Credential] [-ResourceName] [-ResourceGroupName] [-Region]`
4. Authenticate with Azure: To complete the registration process, you need to authenticate (sign in) using your Azure account. Your account needs to have access to the Azure subscription that was specified in step 3 above in order for registration to proceed. Copy the code provided, navigate to microsoft.com/devicelogin on another device (like your PC or phone), enter the code, and sign in there. This is the same experience Microsoft uses for other devices with limited input modalities, like Xbox.
The registration workflow will detect when you've logged in and proceed to completion. You should then be able to see your cluster in the Azure portal.

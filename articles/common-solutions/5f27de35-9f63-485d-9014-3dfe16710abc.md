# Azure Sentinel - Threat Hunting ,Watchlist and Notebooks - How to run a notebook

## **Recommended Steps**

1. If you have a "Kernel not found" issue, select a kernel of the correct language and version and select **Set Kernel**.

2. Before you can use a module in a notebook, you must first install it in the notebook environment. 
   Fixing "ModuleNotFoundError":
   1. Install the required module. The easiest way to do this is to add a code cell to the notebook and enter: 
	      `!pip install MODULE_NAME` 
	  Running this cell installs the module listed. After this is completed, try the import again. 

3. After a module in installed, it must be imported before it can be used. 
   If you run a cell and get a name error for something that you expect to be a module, it's likely that you didn't import the module before calling it.  
  To fix `NameError`:
   1. Import the module by adding an import line at the top of the cell: 
	  `import MODULE_NAME` 
   2. Re-run the cell.

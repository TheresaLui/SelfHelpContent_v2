# Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

Resolve issues with Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Do not use App Service CORS and your own CORS code together. When used together, App Service CORS takes precedence and your own CORS code has no effect. Even if you have configured CORS correctly, you can get the API call blocked by the CORS policy.

# Browser Dependencies data is incorrect or missing on Failure Screen

Most users find that if browser dependencies data is incorrect or missing on the Failure screen, they can resolve issues by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

- If you add Application Insights to your page script, you get timings of page loads and AJAX calls, counts, and details of browser exceptions and AJAX failures
- You can add JavaScript SDK by following [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript#adding-the-javascript-sdk)
- For web pages, Application Insights JavaScript SDK automatically collects AJAX calls as dependencies
- By default, the Application Insights JavaScript SDK [autocollects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript#adding-the-javascript-sdk) a number of telemetry items that are helpful in determining the health of your application and the underlying user experience

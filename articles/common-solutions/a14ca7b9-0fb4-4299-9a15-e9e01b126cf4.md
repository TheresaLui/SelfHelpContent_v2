## **Recommended Steps**

### **Can I manage Azure AD B2C with Microsoft Graph?** 

Microsoft Graph lets you manage many of the resources within your Azure AD B2C tenant, including customer user accounts and custom policies. By writing scripts or applications that call the Microsoft Graph API, you can automate tenant management tasks. Prepare for [using the Microsoft Graph API to automate the management of resources in your Azure AD B2C directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/microsoft-graph-get-started?tabs=app-reg-ga). 

Microsoft Graph API operations supports the management of Azure AD B2C resources, including users, identity providers, user flows, custom policies, and policy keys. See [the complete list of supported operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/microsoft-graph-operations).

# Security Center Pricing self help guide

## **Recommended Steps**

**What are the plans offered by Azure Security Center**?  
Azure Security Center has two offerings: 
- Azure Security Center (free) 
- Azure Defender  
Learn more about [Azure Security Center pricing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing). 


**How do I enable Azure Defender for my subscription?**  
There are several ways to enable Azure Defender for a subscription: 
- [Through the UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing#enable-azure-defender)
- [Through REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/pricings)
- [Through Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/security/pricing?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [Through PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.security/set-azsecuritypricing?view=azps-4.7.0)
- [With a specific policy](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/tree/master/Pricing%20%26%20Settings/Azure%20Policy%20definitions/Azure%20Defender%20Plans)

**Can I enable Azure Defender for servers on a subset of servers in my subscription?**  
No. When you enable Azure Defender for servers on your subscription, all servers in the subscription are covered by Azure Defender. Alternatively, you can enable Azure Defender for servers at the Log Analytics workspace level, so that only servers reporting to this workspace will be protected and billed.  
**Note:** When you enable Azure Defender at the Log Analytics workspace level, several capabilities are unavailable. These features include: just-in-time access, network detection, regulatory compliance, adaptive network hardening, and adaptive application control.  
Learn more about [enabling Azure Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing#enable-azure-defender). 

**Is the 500 MB of free data ingestion calculated for an entire workspace or strictly per machine?**  
You’ll get 500 MB of free data ingestion per day for every machine connected to the workspace, specifically for security data types directly collected by Azure Security Center. This data is a daily rate averaged across all nodes. If some machines send 100 MB and others send 800 MB, and the total doesn’t exceed the [number of machines] x 500 MB free limit, you won’t be charged extra.

# Troubleshoot IDPS

You can apply IDPS service to HTTP and to encrypted HTTPS traffic. 

For HTTPS traffic, Azure Firewall TLS inspection is required in order to decrypt the traffic and to enable the IDPS service to detect malicious activity.

To apply IDPS on HTTPS, a specific application rule must be defined, with the TLS Inspection mode set to `enabled`.

You can fine-tune the IDPS setup, as needed. For example, if you receive a false positive where a legitimate request is blocked by Azure Firewall due to a “faulty” signature, you can use the signature ID from the application rules logs, add a new signature rule, and set the IDPS mode to `off`. This causes the "faulty" signature to be ignored and resolves the false positive issue. 

You can apply the same fine-tuning procedure for signatures that are creating too many low-priority alerts, and therefore interfering with visibility for high-priority alerts.

You can also use signature rules when the IDPS mode is set to `Alert`, but there are one or more specific signatures that you want to block, including their associated traffic. In this case, you can add new signature rules by setting the TLS Inspection mode to `deny`.

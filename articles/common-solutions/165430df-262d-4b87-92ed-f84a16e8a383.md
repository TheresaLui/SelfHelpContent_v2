# Issues Connecting with Web Browsers and other Clients

Most customers are able to resolve their connectivity issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps** 

1. As a first step in resolving any connectivity issues with Azure DevOps, complete the following steps: 

    a. Ask your [Azure DevOps organization owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/lookup-organization-owner-admin?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#look-up-the-organization-owner) to confirm that you have access
    b. [Sign out from Azure DevOps completely](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signout). This will sign out all active sessions from the browser.
    c. Delete the cookies in your browser. To delete cookies in most browsers, press **Ctrl+Shift+Del**. 
    d. Open Internet Explorer and delete the browser cookies. The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies. 
    e. Close all browsers and close the Visual Studio IDE (if you are using it)
    f. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it
    g. Otherwise, open an inPrivate/incognito browser session and navigate directly to your organization (for example, `https://dev.azure.com/{yourOrganization}`) 

2. Ensure your network is configured to allow the [Azure DevOps IPs/URLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url?view=azure-devops)

3. Before you create a support request, check if an outage occurred at [Azure DevOps Services Status](https://status.dev.azure.com/)

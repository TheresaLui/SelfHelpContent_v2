# Issues Connecting with Web Browsers and other Clients

Most customers are able to resolve their connectivity issues with Azure DevOps using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps** 

1. Ask your [Azure DevOps organization owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/lookup-organization-owner-admin?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#look-up-the-organization-owner) to confirm that you have access
2. [Sign out from Azure DevOps completely](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signout). This will sign out all active sessions from the browser.
3. Delete the cookies in Internet Explorer and any other browser you use. To delete cookies in most browsers, press **Ctrl+Shift+Del**.    The Visual Studio IDE uses Internet Explorer cookies. 
4. Close all browsers (including Internet Explorer) and close the Visual Studio IDE (if you are using it)
5. If the issue is with the Visual Studio IDE, remove the connection and re-add it
   Otherwise, open an inPrivate/incognito browser session and navigate directly to your organization (for example, `https://dev.azure.com/{yourOrganization}`) 

6. Ensure your network is configured to allow the [Azure DevOps IPs/URLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url?view=azure-devops)

7. Before you create a support request, check if an outage occurred at [Azure DevOps Services Status](https://status.dev.azure.com/)

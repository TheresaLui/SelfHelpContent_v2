# Access Restrictions         

Most users can successfully set up access restrictions by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

When setting up access restrictions rules, keep these important elements in mind:
1. The name of the rule cannot be more than 32 characters.
2. There is a limit of 512 rows of IP or service-endpoint restrictions. If you require more than 512 rows of restrictions, consider installing a standalone security product, such as Azure Front Door, Azure App Gateway, or a WAF.
3. If IPV6 addresses are getting restricted, it indicates that requests are coming over a service endpoint. For these scenarios, allow traffic for the respective subnet.

# WVD Connection - users unable to connect

Most users can resolve connection issues in Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) using the following steps.

## **Recommended steps**

1. Is this your first deployment? Be sure to review the requirements first:
    * [Using Windows Virtual Desktop with ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics)
    * [Using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/diagnostics-log-analytics-2019)

2. Confirm that you've unblocked the URLs listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/safe-url-list)

3. To diagnose issues, make sure that you have set up a Log Analytics workspace to be able to review diagnostics data:
   * [WVD with ARM: Diagnostics data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics)
   * [WVD (classic): Diagnostics data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/diagnostics-log-analytics-2019)

4. Verify that the agent and side-by-side stack were properly installed, and your session host is able to connect to the broker:
   * [Windows Virtual Desktop Agent Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/troubleshoot-agent)

5. For common error scenarios, see the troubleshooting section in the table of contents of our documentation.

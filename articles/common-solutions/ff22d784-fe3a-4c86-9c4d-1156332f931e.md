Most users are able to resolve issues with self-hosted integration runtime using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

To create a self-hosted IR, go to **Purview Studio** > **Management Center** and register with a key obtained from Purview Studio. 
**Note:** The self-hosted IR from ADF cannot be shared with Purview, or vice versa. 

To connect to the same on-premise data source from both ADF and Purview, install one of the self-hosted IRs in another Azure VM.

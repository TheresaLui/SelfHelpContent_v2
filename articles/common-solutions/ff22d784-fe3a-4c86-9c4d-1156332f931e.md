Most users are able to resolve issues with self hosted integration runtime by using the steps below..

## **Recommended Steps**

As of now, the self-hosted IR needs to be created from Purview Studio-->Management Center and needs to be registered with one of the keys obtained from Purview Studio. Self-hosted IR from ADF cannot be shared with Purview
or the other way round. If you need to connect to the same on-premise data source from both ADF and Purview, it is recommended that you install one of the self-hosted IRs in another Azure VM.

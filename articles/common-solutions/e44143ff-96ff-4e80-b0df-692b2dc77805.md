In case the device network interface card is not working, we recommend the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the local web UI, go to Troubleshooting and Diagnostic tests. Select the test you want to run and click Run test. This runs the tests to diagnose any possible issues with your network, device, web proxy, time, or cloud settings. If your network card is not working, select the 'Network Interfaces' test. You are notified that the device is running tests.
2. After the tests have completed, the results are displayed
3. If a test fails or shows warning for Network Interface card, a URL for recommended action is presented. Click the link to view the recommended action.

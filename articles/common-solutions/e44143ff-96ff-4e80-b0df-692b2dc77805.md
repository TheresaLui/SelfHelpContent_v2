# Device NIC not working.

In case the device network interface card is not working, we recommend the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. In the local web UI, go to **Troubleshooting and Diagnostic tests**
2. Select the test you want to run and then select **Run test**. If your network card is not working, select the **Network Interfaces** test.<br>
   The test diagnoses any possible issues with your network, device, web proxy, time, or cloud settings. 
   
3. Note the following:
   - When the tests start running, you are notified that the device is running the tests 
   - When the tests have completed, the results are displayed  
   - If a test fails or shows a warning for the Network Interface card, it presents a URL. Select the link to view the recommended action.

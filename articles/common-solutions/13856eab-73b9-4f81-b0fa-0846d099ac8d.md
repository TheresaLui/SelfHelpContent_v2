# Azure Private Link for Azure Data Factory


## **Recommended Steps**

* Supporting private links helps to protect a resource from public access. From an Azure Data Factory perspective, there are two scenarios:

  - Authoring and monitoring through the Azure portal, SDK, or API.

  - Self-hosted integration runtime in on-premises or through a customer's virtual network to access Data Factory service.

**Note:** A private link for Azure Data Factory does not enable accessing data stores when you run pipelines. It only enables communication to Data Factory service.

* Currently, it's not possible to block public access through Azure portal, SDK, or API to Azure Data Factory, even if you create a Private Endpoint in your virtual network.

* To secure communication between self-hosted integration runtime and Azure Data Factory, you can create Private Endpoint in your virtual networking in Azure Data Factory (Azure portal). See [set up a Private Link for Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-private-link#set-up-private-link-for-azure-data-factory).

* Currently. interactive authoring that uses a self-hosted integration runtime and self-hosted integration runtime auto-upgrade are not supported in private links for Azure Data Factory. If you want to use these features, you need to set up rules in your networking configuration or corporate firewall to allow these communications access to Data Factory service. See [how to configure domains and outbound ports for self-hosted integration runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime#ports-and-firewalls).

* Make sure that your credentials are stored in an Azure key vault. Otherwise, the credentials won't work when you enable a private link in Azure Data Factory.

* If you are using a custom DNS server on your network, clients must be able to resolve the FQDN for the Data Factory endpoint to the Private Endpoint IP address. See [DNS changes for Private Endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/data-factory-private-link#dns-changes-for-private-endpoints)

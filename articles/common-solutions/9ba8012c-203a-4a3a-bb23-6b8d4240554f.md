# SSAS exceptions, unexpected termination, not responding and unable to start

Most customers can resolve SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) issues (e.g., exceptions, unexpected termination, and non-responsiveness) using the following resources. 


## **Recommended Steps**

- **SSAS instance generated an exception memory dump**<br>
    SSAS generates dump file capture data used for analyzing such events as a server crash, exception errors, and configuration errors. As a best practice, consider upgrading to the latest service pack and update. Review this article to [determine the version, edition, and update level of SQL server and its components](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/sql/general/determine-version-edition-update-level).

- **SQL Server Analysis Services unexpectedly terminates**<br>
    The SSAS instance encountered an exception or error. To resolve this, follow [these instructions and review the log and application event log](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/log-operations-in-analysis-services?view=asallproducts-allversions&viewFallbackFrom=asallproducts-allversion).

- **SSAS instance becomes non-responsive**<br>
    Follow the suggestions in this article: [SQL Server Analysis Services stops accepting new connections](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jason_howell/2012/07/03/analysis-services-stops-accepting-new-connections-processing-commit-locks-hurt/).

- **SQL Server Analysis Services instance stop in the Azure VM and cannot be started up**<br>
   If the SSAS instance encounters an exception or error during startup, follow the recommendations in this article to review the [log and application event log](https://docs.microsoft.com/analysis-services/instances/log-operations-in-analysis-services?view=asallproducts-allversions&viewFallbackFrom=asallproducts-allversion). 

- For all of these issues, run the [SSASDiag Data Collection Tool](https://github.com/ssasdiag/SSASDiag/releases) to collect data on the Analysis Services server. This data can be used for cause analysis.

# Cognitive Services spatial analysis - AI Operation Output

Spatial analysis enables the analysis of real-time streaming video from camera devices. 
For each camera device you configure, the operations for spatial analysis will generate an output stream of JSON messages sent to your instance of Azure IoT Hub.

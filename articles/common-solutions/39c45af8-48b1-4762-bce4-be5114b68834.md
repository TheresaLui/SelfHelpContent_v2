# Create monitoring user

In order to monitor your Azure SQL Database with SQL insights (preview), you need to create a user that will collect the data.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Refer to [our documentation](https://aka.ms/azuresqlinsights/docs/monitoringuser) for creating the monitoring user
2. Ensure that the password you used when creating the monitoring user matches the one stored in Key Vault or in your connection string
3. Connect to your Azure SQL Database (using SSMS or a similar tool) and run the following script:
```
CREATE USER [SqlInsightsUser] WITH PASSWORD = N'mystrongpassword'; 
GO 
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [SqlInsightsUser]; 
GO
```

# Issue with ongoing SQL discovery

Resolve common issues with the following questions and solutions.

## **Recommended Steps**

### **I want to try out the new SQL discovery feature in Azure Migrate**
- To try out this feature, use [this link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2155668L) to create a project in **Australia East** region.
- Refer to the [Discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware) tutorial.
- Note that the discovery of SQL Server instances and databases running in your VMware environment is currently in preview.

### **I am not able to see all the SQL Server instances or databases.**
Most common possible causes are: 
1. Insufficient permissions to collect information from SQL Server instances and databases. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156401).
2. SQL Server service is not running on the source server. 
3. Invalid credentials.
4. SQL discovery data is refreshed once in 24 hours. Please wait for next refresh cycle to run if configuration on source server was changed recently.

### **What are the minimum permissions needed to perform SQL Server discovery?**
Minimum permissions needed to perform SQL Server discovery are documented [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156401).

### **I want to understand how SQL discovery is performed.**
Details on SQL Server discovery are documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware).

### **Discovery is reporting Incorrect database/SQL Server properties.**
SQL discovery data is refreshed once in 24 hours. Please wait for next refresh cycle to run if configuration on source server was changed recently. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware) for more details.

# Troubleshooting performance issues with ACR

Performance issues with Azure Container Registry are most often caused by network latency and bandwidth. Another cause for performance issues are the available resources on the local machine where the image is downloaded and decompressed. Most users are able to resolve their networking issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Check expected network speed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#check-expected-network-speed).
2. [Check client hardware](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#check-client-hardware).
3. [Review configured limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#review-configured-limits).
4. [Configure geo-replicated registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#configure-geo-replicated-registry).
5. [Configure DNS for geo-replicated registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#configure-dns-for-geo-replicated-registry).

To see more detailed troubleshooting information you should enable the resource logs as described in the [following article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-diagnostics-audit-logs).

# Troubleshooting performance issues with ACR

Performance issues with Azure Container Registry are most often caused by network latency and bandwidth. Another cause is the available resources on the local machine where the image is downloaded and decompressed. Most users are able to resolve their networking issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Check expected network speed](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#check-expected-network-speed).
2. [Check client hardware](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#check-client-hardware).
3. [Review configured limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#review-configured-limits).
4. [Configure geo-replicated registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#configure-geo-replicated-registry).
5. [Configure DNS for geo-replicated registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-troubleshoot-performance#configure-dns-for-geo-replicated-registry).

To provide additional information for troubleshooting, [enable the resource logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-diagnostics-audit-logs).

### **I need to enable Password Complexity** 

Azure AD B2C supports granular password complexity policies, in addition to the defaults that are supported in Azure AD. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/password-complexity?pivots=b2c-user-flow&WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support).  

### **I need to disable email verification** 

Although recommended for security purposes, some business requirements might require disabling email verification. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/disable-email-verification?pivots=b2c-user-flow&WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support). 

### **Password reset link is not working** 

Currently, the combined **Sign-up or Sign-in policy** has a limitation that prevents your users from being able to reset their password from the login page. Azure AD B2C will return an error to your application when a user selects the password reset link. There are two different mechanisms to implement password reset: 

1. **Use a Sign-in Policy**: No work required by the application. Selecting **I forgot my password** redirects the user automatically to a generic Microsoft-branded password reset page. 

2. **Handle the error**: This requires the application to do some extra work. Selecting **I forgot my password** redirects the user back to the application with an error code. The application needs to detect that the error code in the request and then further redirect the user to the Azure AD B2C password reset policy. The password reset policy can be customized extensively.

# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Overview and settings 

The overview page provides insights on the security status of your workspace.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Select each element of the tiles to access the raw data from which they are created.

2. You can't change the components of the overview page, but you can create your own [Workbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-monitor-your-data) to function as a customer overview page.

3. To add a new tile, add it to an existing workbook---one that you create or an Azure Sentinel built-in workbook.<br>
      1. In **Log Analytics**, create a tile using instructions in this [Tutorial: Visual data in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/tutorial-logs-dashboards).
      2. After you create the tile, under **Pin**, select the workbook in which you want the tile to appear.
	
4. To see all of your installed Workbooks, go to **Settings**, select **Workbooks**, and look for the **Installed** section. <br>
   Under **All**, you can see the whole gallery of built-in workbooks that are available for installation.

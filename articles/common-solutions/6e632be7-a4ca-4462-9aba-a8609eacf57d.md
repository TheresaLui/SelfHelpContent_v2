# Azure Sentinel - Azure Sentinel management - Overview and settings 

## **Recommended Steps**

The main body of the overview page gives insight at a glance into the security status of your workspace.

1. You can click on each element of these tiles to drill down to the raw data from which they are created.

2. You cannot change the components of the overview page, but you can create your own [Workbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-monitor-your-data) as a customer overview page.

3. If you want to add a new tile, you can add it to an existing workbook, either one that you create or an Azure Sentinel built-in workbook.
	1. In Log Analytics, create a tile using the instructions found in [Tutorial: Visual data in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/tutorial-logs-dashboards).
	2. After the tile is created, under Pin, select the workbook in which you want the tile to appear.
	
4. To see all your installed Workbooks, go to Settings, select Workbooks, and look for the Installed section. 
   Under All, you can see the whole gallery of built-in workbooks that are available for installation.

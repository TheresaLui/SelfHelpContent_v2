# RMS SDK

Most users are able to resolve their Rights Management Services (RMS) SDK issue using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

***For end-users:***

- If you employ third-party applications that use the RMS SDK, the vendor of the third-party application should be your primary point of contact for support. The vendor should also eventually engage Microsoft using cross-vendor support mechanisms, such as TSANet.

- Whenever possible, try to reproduce the issue outside of the custom build application, for example, using AIP client or Office

- Make sure that your client system meets the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/requirements#client-devices) of MSIPC, which are similar to AIP Classic client 



***For software developers:***

- Make sure that you use the latest version of the RMS SDK. You can verify that by inspecting the MSIPC logs (look for MSIPC version).

- To upgrade to a newer version, you must install the updated SDK version on the developerâ€™s dev system, and re-compile the application afterwards

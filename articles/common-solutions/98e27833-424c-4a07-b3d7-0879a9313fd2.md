# SQL Managed Instance Azure Arc stats monitoring using Kibana Grafana

## **Recommended Steps**

### Kibana and Grafana

Kibana and Grafana web dashboards are provided to bring insight and clarity to the Kubernetes namespaces being used by Azure Arc enabled data services.

Kibana is an open-source analytics and visualization web application designed to work with Elasticsearch. Kibana is used to search, view and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices to perform analysis and visualize data in a variety of formats, including charts, tables, and maps.

Grafana is a multi-platform, open-source web application that allows you to query, visualize and alert based on your metrics retrieved from multiple sources in Azure Arc Data Services.

**Kibana Endpoint:**

You can locate the Kibana and Grafana endpoints and use a browser to navigate to the web applications. To locate the Kibana URL use this command:

   ```bash
   azdata arc dc endpoint list --query "[?name=='logsui'].endpoint|[0]"
   ```

**Grafana Endpoint**
To discover the Grafana URL use this command:

   ```bash
   azdata arc dc endpoint list --query "[?name=='metricsui'].endpoint|[0]"
   ```

**Locate IP Address for Azure Virtual Machine:**

To retrieve the public IP address use the following command:

   ```bash
   az network public-ip list -g <azurearcvm-rg> --query "[].{PublicIP:ipAddress}" -o table
   ```

**Additional firewall configuration:**

If you notice that port are blocked at NSG/firewall level, then you may need to open those specific ports so that you can access the Kibana and Grafana endpoints.

Below are the steps to create an NSG rule for the Kibana and Grafana endpoints:

1. **Find the name of the NSG**

   ```bash
   az network nsg list -g azurearcvm-rg --query "[].{NSGName:name}"    -o table
   ```

1. **Add the NSG rule:** Once you find the NSG name, you can add the rules using the following command or can add rules in azure portal as well by adding ports in inbound and outbound rules as per your requirements:

   ```bash
   az network nsg rule create -n ports_31777_30888 --nsg-name       azurearcvmNSG --priority 600 -g azurearcvm-rg --access Allow       --description 'Allow Kibana and Grafana ports'       --destination-address-prefixes '*' --destination-port-ranges 31777       30888 --direction Inbound --protocol Tcp --source-address-prefixes       '*' --source-port-ranges '*'
   ```

1. **Access Kibana and Grafana dashboard on Azure Arc:** Once you get the public IP address and open the ports you should be able to access Grafana and Kibana web-based dashboard. Use the following URL pattern to access the web based Kibana & Grafana dashboards for Azure  Arc SQL MI-AA instance:

   ```bash
   https://<public ip address get from above>:30888/Grafana 
   https://<public ip address get from above>:30888/Kibana
   ```

   **Note**: When prompted to enter a username and password, enter the username and password of the Azure Arc data controller.

# Trigger rerun or cancel runs

If you want to rerun a trigger run or cancel an existing run, use the following steps. 

## **Recommended Steps**

### Rerun

1.	Rerun is only supported on Tumbling Window Trigger runs that are in a final state (for example, **Succeeded**, **Failed**, 
**Cancelled**).  Rerun is not supported on Schedule Trigger. See [Trigger Type Comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers#trigger-type-comparison).
2.	If you are trying to pass new parameters in a trigger rerun, this action is not currently supported. The rerun will take the parameter values passed in the original run.
3.	Rerun is only supported on individual runs by **runID**. For rerunning a large number of runs, implement a custom code that calls a rerun on all the runs, one by one, using SDK or REST API.

### Cancel

1. Cancel is only supported for Tumbling Window Trigger runs that are in **Waiting On Dependency** state
2. For Tumbling Window Trigger runs that are already in progress, cancel the respective pipeline runs instead, which also cancels the respective trigger

### Trigger run is stuck

If a tumbling window trigger is stuck on waiting on dependency state, but upstream dependencies show up as succeeded in the Gantt view, cancel the run, and then rerun the run after cancellation is complete.

## User has no authorization to rerun a pipeline through SDK

If you are able to rerun a pipeline from ADF portal, but not through the SDK, this is because the roles for Azure pPortal and SDK are slightly different, see [Azure roles for ADF](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net#azure-roles). When using the built in roles, 
  * In Azure portal you must have the Data Factory Contributor role at the resource group level or above to be able to create and manage child resources.\
  * In SDK, you need the contributor role at the resource level or above

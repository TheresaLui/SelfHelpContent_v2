# Trigger rerun or cancel runs

If you want to rerun a trigger run or cancel an existing run. Below steps may help you with solutions

## **Recommended Steps**

1.	Rerun is only supported on Tumbling Window Trigger runs which are in final state(Succeeded, Failed, Cancelled). 
2.	If you are trying to pass new parameters in a trigger rerun, it is not currently supported. Rerun will take the parameter values passed in the original run
3.	Rerun is only supported on individual runs by runID. For rerunning a large number of runs, please implement custom code that would call rerun on all the runs one by one using SDK or REST API.
4.	If a tumbling window trigger is stuck on waiting on dependency state. But upstream dependencies show up as succeeded in the Gantt view. Please cancel the run and rerun the run after cancellation is complete.

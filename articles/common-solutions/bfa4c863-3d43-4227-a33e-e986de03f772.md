### **Buying Azure DevOps Cloud Service cloud-based load test**

* **Why can't I buy cloud-based load testing?**
The cloud-based load testing service is deprecated. More information about the deprecation, the service availability, and alternative services can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/overview?view=azure-devops).

* **What does the free tier of cloud-based load testing include?**
The free tier is per organization. Each Azure DevOps organization includes 20,000 virtual user minutes of cloud-based load testing free per month. This free tier resets on the first day of the month. 

* **I have a visual studio subscription license. Does that include any additional cloud-based load test minutes?**
Visual Studio subscriptions don't include any additional virtual user minutes. 

* **Does the free minutes increase when I buy more basic or basic+test plans access level?**
No. The free amounts are per organization, not per user.

* **How does the cloud-based load testing billing work?**
For cloud-based load testing, you're charged for each virtual user minute (VUMs) that exceeds the free monthly usage. Check out this [Q&A here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/reference-qa?view=azure-devops#VUM).

* **Are there any limits on load test runs?**
There's a limit on the duration for each test run. For cloud-based load testing, the limit depends on where you run your test. For details, see [this Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/reference-qa?view=azure-devops#test-limits).

* **Can I use the monthly Azure credits from my Visual Studio subscription to buy Azure DevOps cloud-based load test?**
No, you can't use the monthly Azure credits from [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/subscriber-benefits-vs) to pay for Azure DevOps. Before you make purchases by using this type of Azure subscription, you must [remove your spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/).

* Check the documentation on [load testing your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/get-started-simple-cloud-load-test?view=azure-devops).

* Before you buy more virtual user minutes (VUMs) for cloud-based load testing, you need to setup billing.Please check [How to setup up billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=azure-devops)

# Azure DevOps Services buying cloud-based load test

Most users are able to resolve their issues about purchasing the Azure DevOps cloud-based load test by using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Before you create a support request, check if there is an outage going on at [Azure DevOps Services Status](https://status.dev.azure.com)
* For quick answers to common questions and issues, try the [Azure DevOps Virtual Agent](https://azuredevopsvirtualagent.azurewebsites.net/)


### **Buying Azure DevOps Cloud Service cloud-based load test**

* **Why can't I buy cloud-based load testing?**
The cloud-based load testing service is deprecated. See [information about the deprecation, service availability, and alternative services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/overview?view=azure-devops).

* **What does the free tier of cloud-based load testing include?**
The free tier is per organization. Each Azure DevOps organization includes 20,000 virtual user minutes of cloud-based load testing free per month. This free tier resets on the first day of the month. 

* **I have a visual studio subscription license. Does that include any additional cloud-based load test minutes?**
Visual Studio subscriptions don't include any additional virtual user minutes. 

* **Does the free minutes increase when I buy more basic or basic+test plans access level?**
No. The free amounts are per organization, not per user.

* **How does the cloud-based load testing billing work?**
For cloud-based load testing, you're charged for each virtual user minute (VUM) that exceeds the free monthly usage. See [this Q & A](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/reference-qa?view=azure-devops#VUM).

* **Are there any limits on load test runs?**
There's a limit on the duration for each test run. For cloud-based load testing, the limit depends on where you run your test. For details, see [this Q & A](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/reference-qa?view=azure-devops#test-limits).

* **Can I use the monthly Azure credits from my Visual Studio subscription to buy Azure DevOps cloud-based load test?**
No, you can't use the monthly Azure credits from [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/subscriber-benefits-vs) to pay for Azure DevOps. Before you make purchases by using this type of Azure subscription, you must [remove your spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/).

* Check the documentation on [load testing your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/load-test/get-started-simple-cloud-load-test?view=azure-devops).

* Before you buy more virtual user minutes (VUMs) for cloud-based load testing, you need to set up billing. See [how to set up billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=azure-devops).

* Prerequisites required to set up billing and buy Azure DevOps user licenses are listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/overview?view=azure-devops#prerequisites)

* [Learn how](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-load-testing-vs?view=azure-devops#enable-paid-load-testing) to enable paid load testing for your organization

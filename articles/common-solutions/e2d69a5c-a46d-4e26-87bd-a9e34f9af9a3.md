# Trouble Shooting issues related to Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool (AzAcSnap)

Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool (AzAcSnap) is a command-line tool that enables data protection for third-party databases by handling all the orchestration required to put them into an application consistent state before taking a storage snapshot. After taking the storage snapshot, AzAcSnap returns the third-party databases to an operational state.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. You can install AzAcSnap on the same host as the database (SAP HANA) or on a centralized system. But there must be network connectivity to the database servers and the storage back-end (Azure Resource Manager for Azure NetApp Files or SSH for Azure Large Instance).

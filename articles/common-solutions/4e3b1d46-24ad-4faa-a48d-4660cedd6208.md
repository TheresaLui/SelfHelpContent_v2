# Resource move across subscription

Moving a Data Box Gateway resource to a different subscription or resource group is not supported. 

## **Recommended Steps**

Because your data is tiered to Azure, you can create a new DBG resource in case you want to move your subscription.

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Resource move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources)
* [Data Box gateway limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-gateway-limits)

**Note:** If you are unable to delete the resource, this could be due to subscription-related issues or downtime. Try again after several hours, or enter a support ticket and our team will assist you.

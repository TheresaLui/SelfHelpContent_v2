# MAC signature in HTTP request is not the same as the computed signature issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

If you received the 401 error message *The MAC signature found in the HTTP request is not the same as the computed signature* it can be caused by the following scenarios identified in the article [Diagnose and troubleshoot Azure Cosmos DB unauthorized exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-unauthorized).

Thank you.

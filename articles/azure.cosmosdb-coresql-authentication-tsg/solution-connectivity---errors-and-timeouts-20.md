# Connectivity - Errors and Timeouts

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

You may get connectivity errors due to client, server, or environment (network) issues. If you see no Azure Cosmos DB service advisory error messages in the [Azure Service Health portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/), it may be due to a network issue or high resource contention on the client machine e.g. high CPU, network exhaustion, or high memory utilization.

## **Recommended Steps**  

### **Use latest SDK versions and singleton client**
* Always ensure you are using the latest SDK, [Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK for SQL API: Download and release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-dotnet).
* Ensure you are using singleton client.  

### **Multiple machines cannot connect**  
If the Cosmos DB account you are connecting to is configured to only allow access from within a Virtual Network, then only machines configured for access through allowed Virtual Network subnets will be allowed.  
Follow the tips in the below documentation links to determine connectivity issues and correct:
* [Connection troubleshooting with Azure Network Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-connectivity-overview) 
* [Diagnose outbound connections from a VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview#connection-troubleshoot)
* [Configure access to Azure Cosmos DB from Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-vnet-service-endpoint)

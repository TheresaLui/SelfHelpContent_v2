# Cancel Subscription

If you cancel a paid Azure Support plan, you are billed for the rest of the subscription term. Pay-as-you-go customers can cancel at any time without any penalty fees. You will still owe the balance for any un-billed or unpaid monthly consumption.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Cancel subscription in the Azure portal

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page in Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
2. Select the subscription that you want to cancel. When the blade opens, select **Overview**.
3. Select **Cancel subscription**
4. Follow prompts and finish cancellation
5. Allow up to 30 minutes for the subscription status to update in the portal

If you don't want to cancel your subscription but want to stop charges for a resource, you can [manually delete them using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal#delete-resources).


### Verify that your subscription was canceled

1. Go to the [Subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) page
2. You may need to scroll to the right. Under **Status** is the current state of the subscription.
3. If the status reflects **Disabled**,  the subscription is canceled

Allow up to 30 minutes for the subscription status to update in the portal.

### What is the difference between canceling and deleting a subscription?

To delete a subscription, you must first cancel the subscription. After your subscription is cancelled, Microsoft waits 30-90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or you change your mind. We don’t charge you for keeping the data.

Learn more, see [Microsoft Trust Center – How we manage your data](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-management).

### Delete free trial subscription

If you have a free trial subscription, you don't have to wait 30 days for the subscription to automatically delete. You can delete your subscription three days after you cancel it. The Delete subscription option isn't available until three days after you cancel your subscription.

1. Wait three days after the date you cancelled the subscription
2. Select your subscription on the [Subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) page in the Azure portal
3. Select the subscription you want to delete
4. Select **Overview**, and then select **Delete Subscription**

# Cancel Subscription

If you cancel a paid Azure Support plan, you are billed for the rest of the subscription term. Pay-as-you-go customers can cancel at any time without any penalty fees. You will still owe the balance for any unbilled or unpaid monthly consumption.<br>

**What is the difference between cancelling and deleting a subscription?**

To delete a subscription the subscription must be cancelled first. After your subscription is cancelled, Microsoft waits 30-90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or you change your mind. We don’t charge you for keeping the data. To learn more, see [Microsoft Trust Center – How we manage your data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/data-management)

**Delete free trial subscription**

If you have a free trial subscription, you don't have to wait 30 days for the subscription to automatically delete. You can delete your subscription three days after you cancel it. The Delete subscription option isn't available until three days after you cancel your subscription.

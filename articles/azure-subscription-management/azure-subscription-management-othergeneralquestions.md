_Note:_ If you want to upgrade your Azure subscription (such as switching from free to pay-as-you-go), you need to convert your subscription.<br>

- To upgrade a free trial, see [Upgrade your Free Trial or Microsoft Imagine Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription).<br>
- To change a pay-as-you-go account, see [Change your Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription to a different offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-switch-azure-offer).<br>
- If you can't convert the subscription, [create an Azure support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). Select Subscription Management for the issue type <br>

**To get your invoice in email (.pdf)**
	
- Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade). <br>

- Click **Invoices** then Email my invoice. <br>
- Click **opt in** and accept the terms. You will have to opt in for each subscription you own <br>

_Note:_ If you don't get an email after following the steps, make sure your email address is correct in the [communication preferences on your profile](https://account.windowsazure.com/profile). <br>

If you don't want to get your invoice in email, click **opt out of emailed invoices**. This option removes any email addresses set to receive invoices in email. If you opt back in, you will have to reconfigure recipients. <br>

# General Azure Subscription questions

## **Recommended Steps**

* [Tutorial: Move Azure resources to another resource group or subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-tutorial-move-resources)
* [Services that can be moved](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/move-support-resources) <br>

**Note**: If you want to upgrade your Azure subscription (such as switching from free to pay-as-you-go), you will need to convert your subscription:

* [Upgrade your Free Trial or Microsoft Imagine Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription)
* [Change your Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription to a different offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-switch-azure-offer)<br>
* If you can't convert the subscription, create an Azure support request. Select **Subscription Management** as the issue type.

### Receive Invoices via Email

* Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
* Click **Invoices** then **Email my invoice**
* Click **opt in** and accept the terms. You will have to opt in for each subscription you own.
* If you don't get an email after following the steps, make sure your email address is correct in the [communication preferences on your profile](https://account.windowsazure.com/profile)
* If you don't want to get your invoice in email, click **opt out of emailed invoices**. This option removes any email addresses set to receive invoices in email. If you opt back in, you will have to reconfigure recipients. <br>
* You can send notifications to a different email address other than the Account Owner email address associated with the account:

	1. Go to **My Account** in the top right corner of the Azure homepage
	2. Click on **Usage and Billing**
	3. Click on the **Profile** tab
	4. In the right corner under **Communication preferences**, click **here** to update your email address in which you would like to receive notifications

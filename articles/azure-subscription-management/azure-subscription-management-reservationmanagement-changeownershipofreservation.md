# Add more people to view or manage my existing reservations

## **Recommended Steps**

### **If the user who purchased the reservation is in the organization, then you can do following**

By default, the reservation purchaser and the account owner for the subscription used to purchase the reservation get owner access to the reservation order and the reservations under the reservation order.

* These users can add\other user to the reservation using the Access Control (IAM) tab under reservation. Just click on the reservation, then click on reservation order and provide access
* When adding users to reservations, its better to add them to reservation order so that they can perform exchange and refunds in future.
* You can add other people to the reservations or reservation orders using power shell / CLI. 

You can get list of all reservations orders that you have access to: [Reservation Order-List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/reserved-vm-instances/reservationorder/list)<br>

For this list execute **New-AzureRmRoleAssignment** to provide users with access to individual reservation. <br>

_If the user who purchased the reservation is not in the organization or if you want to change the tenant under which the reservation resides then please proceed with the support ticket._<br>

3. Select the reservation that you want to delegate access to other users

5. Select **Add role assignment > Role > Owner**. Or, if you want to give limited access, select a different role.<br>

# Change ownership of reservation

## **Recommended Steps**

Once Azure Reservation has been purchased, you might need to apply the reservation to a different subscription, change who can manage the reservation, or change the scope of the reservation. You could also split a reservation into two reservations to apply some of the instances you bought to another subscription <br>

**How to  Add or change users who can manage a reservation ?** <br>
You can delegate management of a reservation by adding people to roles on the reservation. By default, the person that bought the reservation and the account administrator have the Owner role on the reservation.<br>
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).<br>
2. Select **All Services > Reservation** to list reservations that you have access to.<br>
3. Select the reservation that you want to delegate access to other users.<br>
4. Select **Access control (IAM).**<br>
5. Select **Add role assignment > Role > Owner**. Or, if you want to give limited access, select a different role.<br>
6. Type the email address of the user you want to add as owner.<br>
7. Select the user, and then select **Save**.<br>

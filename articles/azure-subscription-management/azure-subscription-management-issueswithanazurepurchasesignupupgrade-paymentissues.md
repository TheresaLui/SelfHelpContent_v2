# Purchase,signup or upgrade - payment issues

## **Recommended Steps**

In the Azure portal, as an Account Administrator, you can add a new credit card, update an existing credit card, or delete a credit card that you don't use. For [Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement), payment methods are associated with [billing profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#change-payment-method-for-a-billing-profile). Only the user who signed up for Azure can update the payment method.<br>

**Troubleshoot Payment issues**: Refer to [Troubleshoot payment issues/error scenarios](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4505172/troubleshooting-payment-issues) to see if it resolves your issue.<br>

If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your financial institution, please reach out to your **financial institution** to resolve the issue. Use the below pointers:

   * You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card
   * If card has credit limit to settle the balance
   * If recurring payment is enabled on the card

**Add a new Credit or Debit card to an Azure Subscription**<br>

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa). Search for **Cost Management + Billing**
* Select a Subscription you'd like to add the credit or debit card to and select **Payment methods**
* A credit card form will appear on the right. Enter credit or debit card details.
* To make this card your active payment method, check the box next to Make this my active payment method above the form. This card will become the active payment instrument for all subscriptions using the same card as the selected subscription. Select **Next**.
* To **use a different credit card**, check the box next to the card you'd like to make the active payment method. Click **Set active**.

**Update/Change/Remove an existing Credit or Debit card**

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)
* Search for **Cost Management + Billing**
* Select **Payment methods**. Click on the credit or debit card that you'd like to edit. A credit card form will appear on the right.
* Update the credit or debit card details. Select **Save**
* To **remove**, check the box next to the card that you want to remove
	
**Note**: You can't remove your credit card if it is associated with other active Microsoft subscriptions. You will need to remove the credit card from all active subscriptions that you have with Microsoft and try again. Click **Delete**.

**Payments with credit/debit card**

* In order to be able to make immediate payment, please make sure to [resolve past due balances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance). If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see a Past due balance notification alert in the Account Center or Azure portal.
* The payment may have failed to process if the credit card on file has expired or the charge was declined by your bank. The [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa) can review and update the credit card in the Account Center: [Add/Update my payment method](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card).
* You might have your Azure subscription disabled because your credit is expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated: [Reactivate my subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable).
* **Declined payment**: Please make sure which payment instrument (PI) is getting declined incase you have multiple PI's associated to a subscription. If needed, change the PI by following the steps here: [How to change your credit card](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card).
* **Remove card**: If you need to remove your PI from the subscription, please follow the steps here: [Remove your credit card from the account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#remove-a-credit-card-from-the-account)<br>
* Check the [Payment FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#frequently-asked-questions) to see if it resolves your issue
* If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your financial institution, please reach out to your **fiancial institution** to resolve the issue. Use the below pointers:

   * You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card
   * If card has credit limit to settle the balance
   * If recurring payment is enabled on the card

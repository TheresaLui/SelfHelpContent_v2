# Purchase,signup or upgrade - unable to convert subscription

## **Recommended Steps**

**Azure free trial** account is only for 1 month and once it is upgraded to [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) there will be 12 month free services. When you upgrade from a Free Trial subscription, you keep your remaining credit for the full 30 days after you created the subscription. You also have access to free services for 12 months. If you want to [transfer the subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer) after upgrading, you must wait until the subscription offer ID changes to MS-AZR-003P. The offer ID changes when:

   * You consume all the remaining credit, or
   * 30 days pass since the start of the free trial<br>

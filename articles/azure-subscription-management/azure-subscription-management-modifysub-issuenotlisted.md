## **Recommended Steps**

**Delete/Deprovision subscription**<br>
You can cancel, change, or re-enable your Azure subscription as the [Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa). If you are not the AA, before a subscription can be deprovisioned:

  * A written (email) approval from the Account Administrator (AA) must be obtained.
  * The AA must acknowledge that they understand all data will be permanently deleted
  * If you are unable to do the above, follow [Subscription ownership transfer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer)
  * Justification for deprovisioning.
  * The subscription should already be SUSPENDED. The only exception is if the account is inaccessible, preventing you from suspending the subscription. 
	**Note**: Deprovisioning is an irreversible action. Once the process has been executed all date will be lost. 

**Move Resources**<br>

Azure resources can be moved to either another Azure subscription or another resource group under the same subscription. You can use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API to move resources. Moving a resource only moves it to a new resource group or subscription. It doesn't change the location of the resource.

**Note**: If you want to upgrade your Azure subscription (such as switching from free to pay-as-you-go), you need to convert your subscription.

**Azure Free Trial**<br>

Learn more: [Upgrade Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription)

**Note**: Azure free trial account is only for 1 month and once it is upgraded to pay-g there will be 12 month free services. When you upgrade from a Free Trial subscription, you keep your remaining credit for the full 30 days after you created the subscription. You also have access to free services for 12 months. If you want to [transfer the subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer) after upgrading, you must wait until the subscription offer ID changes to MS-AZR-003P. The offer ID changes when:

* You consume all the remaining credit, or
* 30 days pass since the start of the free trial

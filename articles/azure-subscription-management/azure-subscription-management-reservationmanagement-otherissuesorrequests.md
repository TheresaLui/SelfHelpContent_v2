# Reserved instance - issue not listed

## **Recommended Steps**

**Check if you are impacted by an outage**: [Azure Health Status](https://status.azure.com/status/history/)<br>

### Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure Reservations

* You can exchange a reservation for another reservation of the same type. You can also refund a reservation, up to $50,000 USD per year, if you no longer need it
* It is possible to exchange multiple low cost reservations with one equal or greater costing reservation  if the price of new RI is equal or greater. It is only possible to Exchange multiple RIs for 1 new RI in one transaction
* If a reservation is transferred from one subscription to another there will be no change in reservation expiry date
* If the refund amount for the reservation is more than $50,000 USD then the  self-serve exchange option is unavailable. A support ticket needs to be created for this request and it will be reviewed by the support team and the possible options would be shared.

### Purchase a Reserved Instance
Purchases of RI are only supported under **Pay-As-You-Go (3P)** and **Enterprise Agreement (17P)** offer types.
**Note**: You must be in the role **Owner** on the subscription to buy a Reserved Instance. For purchasing reservations in an enterprise enrollment, the enterprise administrator must enable reservation purchases in the EA portal, by default the setting is enabled for all enrollments.<br>
Before purchasing, please check if the RI is supported for the region you are purchasing since if capacity is unavailable for a region, you will not be able to purchase RI in that region.<br>
Reserved Instance for Pay-As-You-Go is **not** available in the following countries: Brazil, India, China, Taiwan, Russia, Korea, Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia,  Liechtenstein,  Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey.<br>
Refer [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)

### Unable to see the reservation after creation
You might be unable to see the Reserved Instances due to a missing RBAC role that is necessary to have full access to the desired Instances. Please reach out to the Account Administrator of the subscriptions that have the Reserved Instances to follow below steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)<br>
2. Select **All Services > Reservation** to list reservations that you have access to<br>
3. Select the reservation that you want to delegate access to other users<br>
4. Select **Access control (IAM)**<br>
5. Select **Add role assignment > Role > Owner**. Or, if you want to give limited access, select a different role<br>
6. Type the email address of the user you want to add as owner<br>
7. Select the user, and then select **Save**<br>

### Azure Free Account
The Azure Free Account offer includes $200 of Azure credits (to be used within the first 30 days of sign-up) and 12 months of select free services (subject to change).<br>
This offer is limited to one enrollment per eligible customer and cannot be combined with any other offer unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.<br>
Within 30 days of sign-up or upon exhaustion of the customer’s credits (whichever occurs first), the customer must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account by removing the Spending Limit. This allows continued use of the Azure Free Account for the remaining 11 months. After the customer has upgraded, usage outside the initial credits and select free services will be billed at Pay-As-You-Go rates. If the customer elects not to upgrade, the Free Account subscription will be disabled.<br>

# Purchase,signup or upgrade - unable to sign-up

## **Recommended Steps**

**Download your invoice from Azure portal (.pdf)**

* Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal as [a user with access to invoices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access)
* Select **Invoices**
* Click **Download Invoice** to view a copy of your PDF invoice. If it says **Not available**, see [Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date#noinvoice). You can also view your daily usage by clicking the billing period.

**Unexpected Charges**<br>

The anniversary day is the day of the month you purchased the subscription. The invoice is generated on the anniversary date and 10 days later the credit card is charged. Invoice customers need to pay using Wire transfer/check and the details for payment is available on your monthly invoice.

For example, if you purchased the subscription on January 15th, the anniversary day will be the 15th of each month when the invoice is generated and 10 days later the card is charged.

**Note**: If you cancel your subscription/resource in the middle of your billing cycle, you might still see a charge which would be for any usage in the previous month. For example, if your billing cycle was from the 26th of every month to the 25th of the next month & you suspended the subscription on the 23rd, which is 28 days into the billing cycle for June, you might see a charge for the 28 days of use. 
If you see a charge in spite of cancelling a subscription please make sure, you don’t have any other support plans which is causing the charge. If you do, please go ahead and cancel the plan.<br>

**Unable to Upgrade/Sign-up/Purchase Azure**<br>

You may experience an issue when you try to sign up for a new account in the Microsoft Azure portal or Azure account center. Before you troubleshoot the issue, first consider the following suggestions:

* Make sure that the information that you provided for your Azure account profile (including contact email address, street address, and telephone number) is correct
* Make sure that the credit card information is correct
* Make sure that you don’t already have a Microsoft account that has the same information

**Unable to access services**<br>

This may be caused by a disabled subscription, due to outstanding charges. Please make sure to login as an admin to settle the payments before [re-activating the subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable).

**Azure Free Trial**

Azure free trial account is only for 1 month and once it is upgraded to [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) there will be 12 month free services. When you upgrade from a Free Trial subscription, you keep your remaining credit for the full 30 days after you created the subscription. You also have access to free services for 12 months. If you want to [transfer the subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer) after upgrading, you must wait until the subscription offer ID changes to MS-AZR-003P. The offer ID changes when:

  * You consume all the remaining credit, or
  * 30 days pass since the start of the free trial: [Products available monthly for free under Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/)
  
**Unable to create or upgrade to another support plan**

* Make sure to sign in to Azure account center as account admin. If you already have a subscription add a payment method to re-activate it. Please make sure to wait for few hours for the process completion.
* The credit card linked to the current plan might have spending limit or some other issue. Please try linking to another card.

**Note**: Support plans are billed like separate subscriptions and have subscription ID’s associated with them for billing purposes. All subscriptions on an account will receive the benefits associated with that support plan.
      
**Unable to move from one resource group to another**<br>
Only an account admin or the service administrator for the subscription can perform this action. Refer to [move resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources) to learn more.
		
**Azure for Students**

* Azure for Students subscription disabled due to exhausting the spending limit:

   * [Remove any spending limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-spending-limit)

# Browser issues

## **Recommended Steps**

**Troubleshoot Browser issues (Browser hangs, keeps spinning, does not load, etc.)**<br>

Note: You might be affected by an outage. Please check to see if there is an ongoing outage: [Azure Health Status](https://status.azure.com/status/history/)

**Page hangs in the loading status**<br>

If your internet browser page hangs, try each of the following steps until you can get to the Azure portal:

* Refresh the page
* Use a different internet browser
* Use the private browsing mode for your browser. For Internet Explorer: Click **Tools > Safety > InPrivate Browsing**, and then browse and sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or [Azure account center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions).

**You are automatically signed in as a different user**

This issue can occur if you use more than one user account in an internet browser. To resolve the issue, try one of the following methods:

* Clear the cache and delete Internet cookies. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools > Internet Options > Delete**. Make sure that the check boxes for temporary files, cookies, password, and browsing history are selected, and then click Delete.
* Reset the Internet Explorer settings to revert any personal settings that you’ve made. Click **Tools > Internet Options > Advanced** select the **Delete personal settings box > Reset**.
* Use the private browsing mode for your browser. For Internet Explorer: Click **Tools > Safety > InPrivate Browsing**, and then browse and sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or [Azure account center](https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions).

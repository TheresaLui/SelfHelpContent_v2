# switch to another offer

## **Recommended steps**

As a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) customer, you might be able to switch your Azure subscription to another offer.

1. Sign in at [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Select your Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

3. Click **Switch to another offer**. The button is only available if you're on Pay-As-You-Go and done with your first billing period.

# change ownership of my subscription

## **Recommended steps**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Select the subscription for which you want to transfer billing ownership.

3. On the right side of the page, select **Transfer Subscription**.

4. Follow prompts to complete the transfer.

If your current Account Admin has left and you need to take over ownership, continue to open a support request so we can validate the transfer.

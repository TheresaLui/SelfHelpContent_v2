# change ownership of my subscription

## **Recommended steps**

1. [Find out who's the Account admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa).

2. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

3. Select the subscription for which you want to transfer billing ownership.

4. On the right side of the page, select **Transfer Subscription**.

If your current Account Admin has left and you need to take over ownership, continue to open a support request so we can validate the transfer.

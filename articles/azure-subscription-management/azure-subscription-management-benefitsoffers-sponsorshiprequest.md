### Promo Code/Azure Pass Sponsorship Entitlement Verification
Check if you have already redeemed the pass with your account ID via the [Azure Pass](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) website:

   * If yes, you will need to attempt to redeem the subscription via the Azure Portal
   * If not redeemed, you will need to follow the prompts to redeem the promo code
	
### Azure Pass Subscription and Ownership Transfers
SOTs of Azure Pass subscriptions from one account to another are not supported. However, if you need to transfer your  services to a new account, please use a migration instead

### Converting Existing Subscriptions to Azure Pass Sponsorship
It is not possible to convert an existing subscription to an Azure Pass Sponsorship.

### Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer
If you have a payment instrument (PI) & when they reach the usage cap or the duration of their offer ends, the active Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions with a PI will convert to a Pay-as-You-Go (PAYG) subscription (3P).
If there is no PI and you want to re-enable the subscription after it was disabled at the end of their term, the subscription can still be converted to a PAYG. At this time, you will need to remove the monetary cap, add a credit card to re-enable the subscription.<br>

* [Re-enable a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)
* [Add, Update, or Remove a Credit or Debit Card for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)

**Note**: EA customers with an active EA enrollment cannot sign up for Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions.

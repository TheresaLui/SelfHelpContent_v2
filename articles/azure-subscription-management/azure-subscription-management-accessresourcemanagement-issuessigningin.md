### **Unable to access billing history**

* The account admin needs to make sure the user accessing the billing information is added in the Azure Active directory as a guest user: [Add or delete a new user](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory)<br>
* The user then needs to be given a Global admin role: [Assign role to users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal)<br>
* Post this, the user can be given billing access using RBAC policies: [Grant access to billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access)<br>

The **Azure Free Account** offer includes $200 of Azure credits (to be used within the first 30 days of sign-up) and 12 months of select free services (subject to change).
This offer is limited to one enrollment per eligible customer and cannot be combined with any other offer unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.<br>
Within 30 days of sign-up or upon exhaustion of the customer’s credits (whichever occurs first), the customer must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account by removing the Spending Limit. This allows continued use of the Azure Free Account for the remaining 11 months. After the customer has upgraded, usage outside the initial credits and select free services will be billed at Pay-As-You-Go rates. If the customer elects not to upgrade, the Free Account subscription will be disabled.<br>

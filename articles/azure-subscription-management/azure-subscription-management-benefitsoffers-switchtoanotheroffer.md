# how to switch to another offer

## **Recommended Steps**

As a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) customer, you can switch your Azure subscription to another offer in the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).

### Switch a Subscription Offer

  1. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa)
  2. Select your Pay-As-You-Go subscription
  3. Click **Switch to another offer**
  
  _Note:_ The button is only available if you're on Pay-As-You-Go and done with your first billing period.<br>
  
  4. Select the offer you want from the list of offers your subscription can be switched to<br>
  
  _Note:_ This list varies based on the memberships that your account is associated with. Refer [list of available offers you can switch to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-switch-azure-offer#whats-supported) and make sure you have the right memberships.<br>
  
  5. By default, the new subscription is set to the new offer name. You can rename it. Click **Switch Offer** to complete the process.<br>

You might not see the **Switch to another offer** button due to:<br>

  * You're not on [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/). Currently only Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions can be converted to another offer.<br>
  * If you're on [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), learn how to [upgrade to Pay-As-You-Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription)
  * You're still on your first billing period; you must wait for your first billing period to end before you can switch offers
  
_Note:_ To switch offer from a different subscription, [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).<br>

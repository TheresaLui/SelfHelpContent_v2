# how to switch to another offer

If you have an individual subscription with [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/), you can switch your Azure subscription to another offer in the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). For example, you can use this feature to take advantage of the [monthly credits for Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/).<br>

To upgrade from Free Trial, refer to [upgrade your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription).<br>

**Switch Subscription offer**

1. Sign in at [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). Select your individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates.
2. Click **Switch to another offer**. The option is only available if you have a individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates and have completed your first billing period. **Note**: The button is only available if you're on Pay-As-You-Go and done with your first billing period.
3. **Select the offer you want** from the list of offers your subscription can be switched to
4. Depending on the offer you’re switching to, you may see a note about the impact of switching. Go through this list carefully and follow the instructions before you proceed. **Note**: This list varies based on the memberships that your account is associated with. Refer [list of available offers you can switch to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-switch-azure-offer#whats-supported) and make sure you have the right memberships.
5. You can rename your subscription. By default, it is set to the new offer name. Click **Switch Offer** to complete the process.

You might not see the Switch to another offer button due to:

* You're not on [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/). Currently only Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions can be converted to another offer.
* If you're on [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), learn how to [upgrade to Pay-As-You-Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription)
* You're still on your first billing period; you must wait for your first billing period to end before you can switch offers

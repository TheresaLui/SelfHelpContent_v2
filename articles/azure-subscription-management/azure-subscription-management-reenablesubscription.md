# Re enable Subscription

Your Azure subscription can get disabled because your credit has expired, you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was cancelled by a Service Administrator or Subscription owner. Refer below on how you can re-enable your subscription
Learn more: [Reactivate Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)

## **Recommended Steps**

**Re-enable your Azure Subscription (subscription was accidentally cancelled)** <br>
If you have permissions, you can reactivate an individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Subscriptions page in Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
2. Go to subscriptions and select the cancelled subscription
3. Click **Reactivate**
4. Confirm reactivation by selecting OK

**Need to make a payment** <br>
A subscription can be disabled due to a non-payment. To re-enable a subscription, navigate to invoices under billing and select Pay Now to make a one-time payment. Avoid missing future payments by navigating to payment methods and updating your payment information.

**Made a payment but subscription is still disabled** <br>
It can take up to 24 hours after a payment has been made for your subscription status to reflect your payment. If it has been longer then 24 hours and your subscription is still disabled, please submit a support request for further assistance.

**Tried self-reactivation and failed** <br>
After selecting OK to confirm reactivation, please allow up to 30 minutes for the changes to be reflected in the portal. To check if the subscription is reactivated, refresh the page and check the status of the subscription. If the subscription is still in a disabled state after 30 minutes, please submit a support request for further assistance.

### **Spending Limit reached**
When your usage reaches the spending limit, Azure disables your subscription for the remainder of that billing period. Your subscription is disabled to protect you from accidentally incurring charges for usage beyond the credit included with your subscription. To remove your spending limit, see [Azure spending limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit).<br>

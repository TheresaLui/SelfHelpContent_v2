Follow the steps in the article below to get your subscription reactivated: [Reactivate my subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-subscription-become-disable)
* **Declined payment**: Please make sure which payment instrument (PI) is getting declined incase you have multiple PI's associated to a subscription. If needed, change the PI by following the steps here: [How to change your credit card](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card)
* **Remove card**: If you need to remove your PI from the subscription, please follow the steps here: [Remove your credit card from the account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card#remove-a-credit-card-from-the-account)
* If there is a pending payment on the card since the card was denied by your **financial institution**, please reach out to your financial institution to resolve the issue. Use the below pointers

   * You might have to check with the bank to see if the international transaction is enabled on the card
   * If card has credit limit to settle the balance

# re-enable a subscription

## **Recommended steps**
Here are some common reasons a subscription can get disabled and how you can re-enable it.

* You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month.<br>

* A payment may be past due.<br>

* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can reactivate it in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). If it's not, please continue to open a support request.<br>

To determine the Account Administrator of your subscription - click **Subscriptions** on the left pane, select your subscription, click **Properties** under Settings, then scroll down to view the Account Admin's email address. <br>

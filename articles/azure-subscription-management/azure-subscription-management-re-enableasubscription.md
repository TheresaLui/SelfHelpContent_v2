# re-enable a subscription

## **Recommended steps**
Here are some common reasons a subscription can get disabled and how you can re-enable it.

1. You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month.<br>
[Learn more about Spending Limit and how to remove it](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/)
2. A payment may be past due.<br>
[Address past due balance](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance/)
3. Your Account Admin may have cancelled the subscription. Also only your Account Admin can access 'billing' details. To determine the 'Account Administrator' of your subscription - click on 'Subscriptions' on the left pane in Azure portal, select your subscription, click 'Settings', select 'Properties' and scroll down on the properties blade to view the Account Admin's email address.

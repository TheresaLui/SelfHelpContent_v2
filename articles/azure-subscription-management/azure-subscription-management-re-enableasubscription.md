# re-enable a subscription

## **Recommended steps**

* [Find out who's the Account Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-subscription-transfer#whoisaa).

* Your Account Admin may have canceled the subscription. If it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, the Account Admin can reactivate it in the Account Center. <br>
[Reactive a canceled subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing-subscription-become-disable#the-subscription-was-canceled-by-the-account-administrator)

* You may have reached the spending limit. If your usage exceeds the monthly credit included in your offer, we disable service for the remainder of the billing month.<br>

* A payment may be past due.<br>

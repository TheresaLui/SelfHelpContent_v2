### Issues with Signup

You may experience an issue when you try to sign up for a new account in the Microsoft Azure portal or Azure account center. Before you troubleshoot the issue, first consider the following suggestions:<br>

  * Make sure that the information that you provided for your Azure account profile (including contact email address, street address, and telephone number) is correct.<br>
  * Make sure that the credit card information is correct.<br>
  * Make sure that you don’t already have a Microsoft account that has the same information.<br>

* Learn more: [Troubleshoot Sign-up Issues](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4467267/can-t-sign-up-for-azure-in-azure-portal-or-azure-account-center) <br>
* Activate your Bizspark benefit: [Activate](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0064p/)<br>

_Note:_ If you remove the [Spending Limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), charges will be incurred at the [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) rates. If you maintain the Spending Limit and you use your monthly credit in full or you use any service that is excluded from payment by monthly credit, your subscription will be suspended for the remainder of the billing period. You will be notified at least 30 days in advance of any increases to the rates. Any taxes which may result from receiving services at no charge are the sole responsibility of the recipient. You must maintain an active Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, provided by your organization based on its membership in the [Microsoft BizSpark](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4055667/bizspark-support) startup program, to enjoy this benefit. This offer is limited to one per subscriber.<br>

# I'm having an issues with my YARN application

## **Recommended Steps**
 In order to debug issues with YARN applications, the following aspects might be helpful.
 
 1. **YARN Timeline Server**: The YARN Timeline server provides generic information on completed applications and framework-specific application information
 2. **YARN Application logs**: The application logs can be useful in debugging issues. The aggregated logs are stored in the path `/app-logs/<user>/logs/<applicationId>`.
 3. **YARN CLI tools**: After connecting to HDInsight cluster using SSH, the YARN logs can be collected using: `yarn logs -applicationId <applicationId> -appOwner <user-who-started-the-application>`
 4. **YARN ResourceManager UI**: Add /yarnui/hn/logs/ to the end of the cluster URL to view the YARN logs

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following issue

We determined that creation of the HDInsight cluster <!--$ClusterDnsName-->[ClusterDnsName]<!--/$ClusterDnsName--> failed because there is a public policy in place to deny the creation of public IPs. HDInsight cluster creation requires two public IPs.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Please remove the policy <!--$policyDefinitionName-->[policyDefinitionName]<!--/$policyDefinitionName--> to allow public IP creation and then reattempt creation of the HDInsight cluster. The policy can be populated after cluster creation.

## **Recommended Documents** 

* [Create and manage policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage)

# I can't log in to my cluster

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve common issues, try one or more of the following steps. Also, keep in mind that when logging into the cluster or app dashboards, use your "cluster login" or "HTTP" credentials. When connecting remotely, use your Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop credentials.

1. To reset the cluster login password, use the "Reset Credential" button in the [SSH + Cluster login](data-blade:Microsoft_Azure_HDInsight.LinuxLoginSettingBlade) tab
2. For Linux clusters, if you cannot recall your SSH credentials, you can [reset the credentials within the Ambari UI](https://docs.azure.cn/hdinsight/hdinsight-administer-use-portal-linux#change-passwords)

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following issue

You have reached the limit on the maximum number of deployments allowed per resource group. Current deployment quota is <!--$DeploymentQuota-->[DeploymentQuota]<!--/$DeploymentQuota-->. Please delete deployments that are no longer needed from the deployment history of resource group '<!--$ResourceGroup-->[ResourceGroup]<!--/$ResourceGroup-->' to resolve the issue. 

## **Recommended Steps**

You can clean up the deployment history using one of the following methods:

### Delete deployments using Portal

1. Login to portal and navigate to the resource group <!--$ResourceGroup-->[ResourceGroup]<!--/$ResourceGroup-->
2. Select 'Deployments' from the resource group
3. Select and delete the deployments that are no longer needed

### Delete deployments using PowerShell

Refer to the [Handling Azure Resource Manager Deployment Limits](https://sharepointforum.org/threads/handling-azure-resource-manager-deployment-limits.52107/) documentation.

### Periodic deletion using Runbook

You can also setup a scheduled [Runbook within Azure Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/start-runbooks) to execute a PowerShell script to periodically clean out the stored Resource Group Deployments.

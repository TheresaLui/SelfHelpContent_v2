# Create HDInsight Cluster

## **Recommended Steps**

### Permissions issues

* If you are using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and receive the error `AmbariClusterCreationFailedErrorCode - Internal server error occurred while processing the request. Please retry the request or contact support.`, open the Azure portal, go to your Storage account, and under Access Control (IAM) ensure that the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** or the **Storage Blob Data Owner** role has Assigned access to the **User assigned managed identity** for the subscription. See [Set up permissions for the managed identity on the Data Lake Storage Gen2 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-use-data-lake-storage-gen2#set-up-permissions-for-the-managed-identity-on-the-data-lake-storage-gen2-account) for detailed instructions.
* If you are using [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-use-data-lake-store), understand that it is not supported for HBASE clusters, and is not supported in HDI version 4.0
* If you are using Azure Storage, ensure that the storage account name is valid during the cluster creation
* A subscription-based Azure policy is in place, denying the creation of public IPs. HDInsight cluster creation requires two public IPs.

The following policies often impact cluster creation:

  * Policies preventing the creation of IP Address & Load balancers within the subscription<br>
  * Policy preventing the creation of a storage account<br>
  * Policy preventing the deletion of networking resources (IP Address /Load Balancers)

### The customer has a firewall on their VNET, and Storage accounts rules which deny traffic

* You must always allow traffic from the following IP addresses:

    * 168.61.49.99
    * 23.99.5.239
    * 168.61.48.131
    * 138.91.141.162

* These IP addresses Destination must be set at **\*:433** and a Direction of "Inbound"<br>
* If your cluster is in a specific region, add the respective source IP, which is listed in the following [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network#hdinsight-ip)<br>
* If you are using either Express Route or your own custom DNS server, please follow [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network#multinet)

### Resources have locks which impact cluster creation

* Please ensure that there are no [locks on your VNET or Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources)

### The customer is using an unsupported version of HDI and/or Apache Hadoop Component

* Please ensure that you are using a [supported HDI version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-component-versioning#supported-hdinsight-versions) AND [Apache Hadoop Component version](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-component-versioning#apache-hadoop-components-available-with-different-hdinsight-versions)

### The Storage Account name is violating Storage Account name restrictions

* Storage Account names cannot be more than 24 characters and Storage account name cannot contain a special character. These restrictions also apply to the default container name in the storage account.

### A service outage

* Check [Azure Status](https://status.azure.com/status) for any potential outages or service issues

# I'm having issues with my YARN application

## **Recommended Steps**

To solve issues with YARN applications, the following articles might be helpful:

* **YARN Timeline Server**: The YARN Timeline server provides generic information on completed applications and framework-specific application information
* **YARN Application logs**: The application logs can be useful in debugging issues, with aggregated logs being stored in the path `/app-logs/<user>/logs/<applicationId>`
* **YARN CLI tools**: After connecting to HDInsight cluster using SSH, the YARN logs can be collected using `yarn logs -applicationId <applicationId> -appOwner <user-who-started-the-application>`
* **YARN ResourceManager UI**: Add `/yarnui/hn/logs/` to the end of the cluster URL to view the YARN logs

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

## Problem
The cluster delete operation for <!--$ClusterDnsName-->[ClusterDnsName]<!--/$ClusterDnsName--> failed because there are locks on some of the resources in its resource group.

Since the delete did not succeed, a new cluster with the same name cannot be created in the same vNet.

## Locked Resources
<!--$LockedResources-->[LockedResources]<!--/$LockedResources-->

## **Recommended Steps**

The locks on the above resources need to be removed before the delete can succeed. Please refer to [Using Azure Resource Locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources) for instructions to remove these locks.

Once this is done, please notify Azure support and we will clean up the HDInsight cluster.

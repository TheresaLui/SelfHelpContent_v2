* User groups specified during the cluster creation process are synchronized at that time. User synchronization occurs automatically once every hour. To synchronize the users immediately, or to synchronize a group other than the groups specified during cluster creation, please follow this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-sync-aad-users-to-cluster#use-the-apache-ambari-rest-api-to-synchronize-users)

* On-premises Active Directory or Active Directory on IaaS VMs: If you are using federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), you must [enable password hash sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance). If federation is being used and password hashes are synced correctly, but you are getting authentication failures, check if cloud password authentication is enabled for the PowerShell service principal.

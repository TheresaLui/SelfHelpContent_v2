# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following issue

We determined that creation of the HDInsight cluster <!--$ClusterDnsName-->[ClusterDnsName]<!--/$ClusterDnsName--> failed because there is a public policy in place to deny the creation of public IPs. HDInsight cluster creation requires two public IPs.

## **Recommended steps**
Please remove the policy <!--$policyDefinitionName-->[policyDefinitionName]<!--/$policyDefinitionName--> to allow public IP creation and then reattempt creation of the HDInsight cluster. The policy can be populated after cluster creation.

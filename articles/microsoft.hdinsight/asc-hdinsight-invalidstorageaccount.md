# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following issue

There is a problem with the storage account required to create your HDInsight cluster. <br>
The storage account selected does not support page blobs which is a requirement for this cluster type.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Select the account kind as Storage(general purpose) instead of BlobStorage while creating a storage account.
2. Select the storage account you created while configuring your HDInsight cluster.

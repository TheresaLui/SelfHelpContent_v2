# Ambari Service is running on both headnodes

## We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
The HDInsight cluster <!--$ClusterDnsName-->[ClusterDnsName]<!--/$ClusterDnsName--> has Ambari server running on both headnodes: <!--$Host-->[Host]<!--/$Host-->

Ambari server running on headnodes other than the **headnodehost** will not display any metrics on the Ambari portal.
<!--/issueDescription-->

In an HDInsight cluster, the **headnodehost** is the default headnode on which ambari server is started. All Ambari agents in the cluster will send heartbeats to only one headnode, which is the **headnodehost**. Since the **headnodehost** is receiving heartbeats from all machines, it can display the corresponding metrics correctly. Other instances of the Ambari server running on the other headnode cannot receive the heartbeats, so they cannot display the metrics.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. You can connect to Ambari service using Secure Shell (SSH): `ssh <clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net`
2. Run the following command to open host file /etc/host on one of the headnodes using Vi: `vi /etc/hosts/`
3. Look for the headnode with **headnodehost** next to it. This is the active node. The other headnode is the standby node.
4. Run the following command to stop Ambari service on the standby node: `sudo systemctl stop ambari-server`

# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found the following issue

The virtual machine booted up with a read-only file system. The following node(s) are in read-only mode: <!--$AlertHost-->[AlertHost]<!--/$AlertHost--> <br>

The drive has to be remounted in read-write mode.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. You can connect to Ambari service using Secure Shell (SSH): `ssh <clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net`

2. SSH into the affected node and run the following command to identify the read-only disk with drive and partition: `mount -l | grep sd`

3. Run the following commands to change it to read-write mode:

 ```       
        sudo fsck.ext4 -f /drive/partition
        sudo mount -o remount,rw /drive/partition
 ```
 
    Replace /drive/partition with the affected drive and partition e.g /dev/sda

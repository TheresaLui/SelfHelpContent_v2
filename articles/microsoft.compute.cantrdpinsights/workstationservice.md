# Netlogon Service is not running

<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that the Workstation service is not running on this virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> causing a loss of network connectivity.

Workstation service creates and maintains client network connections to remote servers using the SMB protocol. If this service is stopped, these connections will be unavailable. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve this issue, please try the steps below using the Azure virtual machine serial console.  If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the serial console or would like additional information, please refer to our user [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console)

#### From the console: ####
  * Query the state of the service by executing `sc query LanmanWorkstation`
  * If the service is stopped, try starting the service by executing `sc start LanmanWorkstation`
  * If the service is hung with a status starting or stopping, try to stop the service `sc stop LanmanWorkstation` and start it again using `sc start LanmanWorkstation`
  * Once the service is started, set the service startup type to automatic by executing `sc config LanmanWorkstation start= auto`

If the service is not starting due to an error or an issue with dependent processes, a memory dump needs to be collected to continue troubleshooting. If this is the case for you, please email us with your approval to collect a memory dump of this VM and we will investigate further.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Before proceeding further please ensure to take a back up of the OS Disk. This will help if a rollback is required

  * For managed disk VMs, please navigate to the [snapshots blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2Fsnapshots) to create a snapshot of the OS disk. For details instructions, see the article [Create a snapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk)<br>
  * For unmanaged VMs save a copy of the OS disk by following the instructions at [Create a copy of a specialized Windows VM running in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/create-vm-specialized#option-3-copy-an-existing-azure-vm)

2. To regain connectivity to the VM, please try [resetting the NIC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/reset-network-interface).
3. Reset the Remote Desktop service configuration (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/reset-rdp#reset-the-remote-desktop-service-configuration)
4. Verify the RDP connectivity the VM.

 In case the VM is inaccessible still, a memory dump needs to be collected to continue troubleshooting. If this is the case for you, please email us with your approval to collect a memory dump of this VM and we will investigate further.

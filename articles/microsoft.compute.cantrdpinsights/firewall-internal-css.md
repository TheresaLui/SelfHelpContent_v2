# Windows Firewall is not running

<!--issueDescription-->
The Windows firewall service is not running in your virtual machine. The service must be running to enable network connectivity to the virtual machine.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve the issue, please try the steps below using the Azure virtual machine serial console tool.  If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the serial console or would like additional information, please refer to our user [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console).
#### From the console: ####
  * Query the state of the service by executing `sc query Mpssvc`
  * If the service is stopped, try starting the service by executing `sc start Mpssvc`
  * If the service is hung with a status starting or stopping, try to stop the service `sc stop Mpssvc` and start it again using `sc start Mpssvc`
  * Once the service is started, set the service startup type to automatic by executing `sc config Mpssvc start= auto`

If the service is not starting due to an error or an issue with dependent processes, a memory dump needs to be collected to continue troubleshooting.

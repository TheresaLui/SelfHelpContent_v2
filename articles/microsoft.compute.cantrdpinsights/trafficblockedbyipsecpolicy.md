# Possible impact to inbound traffic by an IPSec policy
<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that an IPSec policy is configured on this virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> which can potentially impact the inbound connectivity.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Before proceeding further please ensure to take a backup of the OS Disk. This will help if a rollback is required

  * For managed disk VMs, please navigate to the [snapshots blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2Fsnapshots) to create a snapshot of the OS disk. For details instructions, see the article [Create a snapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk)<br>
  * For unmanaged VMs save a copy of the OS disk by following the instructions at [Create a copy of a specialized Windows VM running in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/create-vm-specialized#option-3-copy-an-existing-azure-vm)

2. To resolve the issue, please try the steps below using the Azure virtual machine serial console.  If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the serial console or would like additional information, please refer to our user [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console).

#### From the console: ####

1. From the command prompt, query the IPSEC Enforcement configuration to validate if 'IPsec Relying Party client' enforcement is enabled:
 ```
 netsh nap client show configuration
 ```

2. Disable the policy by executing the below command:
 ```
 netsh nap client set enforcement ID = 79619 ADMIN = "DISABLE"
 ```

3. Validate if the connectivity to the VM is restored.

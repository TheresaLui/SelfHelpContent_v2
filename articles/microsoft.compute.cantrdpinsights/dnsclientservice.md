# DNS Client Service is not running

<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that the DNS Client service is not running on this virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname-->, causing a loss of network connectivity. This could happen if the service is disabled accidentally or if the service is crashing or hung.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve the issue, please try the steps below using the Azure virtual machine serial console.  If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the serial console or would like additional information, please refer to our user [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console).

#### From the console: ####
  * Query the state of the service by executing `sc query DNSCache`
  * If the service is stopped, try starting the service by executing `sc start DNSCache`
  * If the service is hung with a status starting or stopping, try to stop the service `sc stop DNSCache` and start it again using `sc start DNSCache`
  * Once the service is started, set the service startup type to automatic by executing `sc config DNSCache start= auto`

If the service is not starting due to an error or an issue with dependent processes, a memory dump needs to be collected to continue troubleshooting. If this is the case for you, please email us with your approval to collect a memory dump of this VM and we will investigate further.

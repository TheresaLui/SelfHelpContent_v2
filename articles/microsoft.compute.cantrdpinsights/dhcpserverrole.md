# Unsupported DHCP server role installed on the VM
<!--issueDescription-->
We have investigated and identified that DHCP sever role is installed on this VM <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> impacting connectivity. As mentioned in our [public documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines?wa=wsignin1.0) DHCP server role is not supported on Azure virtual machines.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Before proceeding further please ensure to take a backup of the OS Disk. This will help if a rollback is required.

  * For managed disk VMs, please navigate to the [snapshots blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2Fsnapshots) to create a snapshot of the OS disk. For details instructions, see the article [Create a snapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk)<br>
  * For unmanaged VMs save a copy of the OS disk by following the instructions at [Create a copy of a specialized Windows VM running in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/create-vm-specialized#option-3-copy-an-existing-azure-vm)

2. To resolve this issue, please try the steps below using the Azure virtual machine serial console.  If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the serial console or would like additional information, please refer to our user [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/serial-console).

#### From the console: ####

1. From the PowerShell prompt, query the roles of the machine to confirm DHCP role is installed.
```
get-windowsfeature DHCP
```

2. Remove the DHCP role executing the below command and restart the virtual machine.
```
dism /online /disable-feature:DHCP
```

3. Now check if the connectivity to the VM is restored.

# Checking adjacency table for VNETs

In this step , you'll be verifying the Connectivity of Spoke VNETs by looking at routes advertised/learned by  HUB and spoke VNETs in the adjacency table in ASC.

To get the adjacency details, please refer to the ASC HUB page Adjacency section and select the VNET in the dropdown. If you want to check using Jarvis action please look into bullet points 3&4 from the link below : https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureNetworking/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/400028/VWAN-Routing-TS?anchor=required-information

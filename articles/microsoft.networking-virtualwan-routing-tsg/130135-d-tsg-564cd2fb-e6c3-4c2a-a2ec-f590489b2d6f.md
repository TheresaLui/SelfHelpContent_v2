# D Get NIC effective routes

In this step, you'll have to pull up a virtual machine from the spoke VNET youâ€™re having issues with and get the NIC effective routes. 

	Note: Traffic does not hit route service in this scenario.

Please use the steps below:

1. Open a VM in the spoke VNET in ASC (Any VM should work which is in running state) 
1. Navigate to Diagnostics tab on ASC 
1. Run a test traffic from VM IP as source to destination IP address on port customer wants to connect on or for just testing you can use port 80 as destination port. 
1. Open, HUB VNET and look for AzureFirewallSubnet address prefixes. Use [this link](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureNetworking/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/400028/VWAN-Routing-TS?anchor=required-information) to pull HUB VNET and note down the Azure firewall subnet address prefix.
1. Now, look at the effective routes on the Spoke VNET VM, find the destination address space and check if you can see the next hop IP address as one of the Azure Firewall Subnet addresses.

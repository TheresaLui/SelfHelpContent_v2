	Note: If associated or propagated to none route table, routes associated to that connection will not be advertised.

Please look into the route table associations and propagations. Make sure both the VNET connections are associated and propagated to/in the same route table.

Make sure the above are verified and work with a TA in Teams to move towards closure.

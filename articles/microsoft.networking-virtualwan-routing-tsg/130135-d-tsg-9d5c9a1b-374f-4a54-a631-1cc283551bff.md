# C Check virtual network connections to the HUB

In this step you'll be checking if the VNETs are connected to the hub. Please refer to the step below:

There are 3 different places to check those connections as below:

1. Look into the Virtual Network Connections section of HUB in ASC.
1. Open the HUB VNET and look for peerings to the spoke VNETs. (Use [this link](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureNetworking/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/400028/VWAN-Routing-TS?anchor=required-information) on how to do so and refer to 3rd bullet point.
1. Ask customer for spoke VNETs resource URI and open those VNETs and look for peering to HUB address space.

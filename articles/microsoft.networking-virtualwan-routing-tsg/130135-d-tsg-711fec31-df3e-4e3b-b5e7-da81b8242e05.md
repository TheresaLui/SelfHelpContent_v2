# DA Check the routes learned by a gateway

In this step you'll be checking is the gateway is learning all the source and destination address prefixes. Use the steps below to do so:

* Navigate to Routes learned by gateway section on HUB in ASC 
* You can use the link below by pulling the Sub ID and gateway ID from child gateway with Jarvis actions : https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/1B89603E?genevatraceguid=0d348670-8105-4663-b88a-935b3666d426. (To pull the SUB ID and Gateway ID, refer to 5th bullet point in [this link](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureNetworking/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/400028/VWAN-Routing-TS?anchor=required-information))

		Note: If gateway is not learning routes from *on-prem*, look into VPN gateway troubleshooter to get the routes from On-prem.

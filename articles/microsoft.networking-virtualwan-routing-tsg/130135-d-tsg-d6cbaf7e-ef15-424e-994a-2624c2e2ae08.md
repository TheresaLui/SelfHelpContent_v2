# BB Check Route table in the HUB Routing

In this step you'll be checking if the branch and VNET connections for source and destination are associated and propagated to the same route table. 

Please use the steps below to do so:

In ASC HUB, navigate to the route table section and see if the VNET connections and Branch connections of source and destination are associated and propagated to same route table. (It can be default route table or any custom route table customer created and wants to use). 

Make sure VNET connection and Branch connection is associated to the same route table. 

	Note: If associated or propagated to none route table, routes associated to that connection will not be advertised.

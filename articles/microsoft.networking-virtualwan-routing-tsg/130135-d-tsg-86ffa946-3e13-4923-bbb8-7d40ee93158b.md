# D Check address prefixes in spoke VNET adjacency

By default, RFC 1918 prefixes are automatically included in the private traffic range. However, if your customer uses public IP ranges in Virtual Networks and Branch Offices, you will need to specify those IP prefixes explicitly. The public IP prefixes can be specified individually or as aggregates.
	
To add those public IP prefixes customer is using in Virtual Networks and Branch Offices use the below steps:

* Azure Firewall Manager--> Security Configuration-->Private traffic Send via Azure firewall (enabled)
* Then, open the “Private traffic prefixes” tab next to the private traffic drop down and add those public IP prefixes customer is using in Virtual Networks and Branch Offices.

Once the above is done, you should see RFC1918 and all the public IP address prefixes customer added to “Private traffic prefixes” tab populated in default route table static routes. (If internet traffic is also enabled, you'll see 0/0 route too in default route table static routes)

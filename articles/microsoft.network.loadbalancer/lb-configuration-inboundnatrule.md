# Azure Load Balancer Inbound Nat Rules Set Up

## **Troubleshooting Insights**
* nbound NAT rules let you configure port forwarding for individual virtual machines in the backend of a load balancer. Learn more about inbound NAT rules [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-port-forwarding-portal).
* To learn more about how to create an inbound NAT rule, read more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-port-forwarding-portal#create-an-inbound-nat-port-forwarding-rule). 
* Understand when to use inbound NAT rules versus [load balancing rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/components#load-balancing-rules). 
  1. To forward traffic from a specific port of the frontend IP address to a specific port of a backend VM, use inbound NAT rules. 
  2. To load balance traffic to all instances within the backend pool, use load balancing rules. A load balancing rule maps a given frontend IP configuration and port to multiple backend IP address and ports.

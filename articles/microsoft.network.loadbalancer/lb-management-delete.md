# Azure Load Balancer delete issues

## **Recommended Steps**


* If your load balancer is in a failed state, follow these steps to bring it back from failed state:
1. Go to https://resources.azure.com, and sign in with your Azure portal credentials.
2. Select Read/Write.
3. On the left, expand Subscriptions, and then expand the Subscription with the Load Balancer to update.
4. Expand ResourceGroups, and then expand the resource group with the Load Balancer to update.
5. Select Microsoft.Network > LoadBalancers, and then select the Load Balancer to update, LoadBalancer_1.
6. On the display page for LoadBalancer_1, select GET > Edit.
7. Update the ProvisioningState value from Failed to Succeeded.
8. Select PUT.
* If the load balancer has virtual machine scale sets in the backend pool, follow the [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-virtual-machine-scale-sets#inbound-nat-pool) on how to delete inbound NAT pool first

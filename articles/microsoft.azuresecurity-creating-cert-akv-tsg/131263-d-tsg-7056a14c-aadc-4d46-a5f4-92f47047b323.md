# Integration with Certificate Authority

Azure Key vault supports 2 trusted CAs - DigiCert and GlobalSign. This means that for the certificates issued by these CAs, Key Vault can take care for end-to-end life cycle management of the certificates (that includes certificate renewal). But if the certificate is coming from a different CA, the customer will be responsible for the certificate management. [Steps for integrating KV with DigiCert ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/how-to-integrate-certificate-authority).

**Support boundary for integration scenarios:-**

When the user creates the certificate after integrating with Digicert CA for the first time then the error likely could be because of incorrectly integrating Digicert.
When the user creates the certificate and the certificate is in 'pending' state then the issue is from CA side. In that case, ask the customer to reach out to the Digicert support team.

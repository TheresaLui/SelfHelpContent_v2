# Escalation

To get help with this problem, you can:

1. Ask Another engineer on your team
2. Post a question on Teams channel: Cloud Identity – User Provisioning /Health > AAD Connect  (https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a6443acc4b72c471bac9e2ba039fa713a%40thread.skype/AAD%2520Connect?groupId=70b122d3-4d70-4357-b412-a8051556c3a4&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
3. Ask your TA for help with investigation, or creation of an ICM

To create an ICM, you should:

1. If you’re a member of the Azure Identity team, you can start an ICM directly from ASC within the support case context or by selecting the appropriate template from (https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CloudIdentityPOD/SitePages/CID%20CRI%20Template%20List.aspx) (Select the AAD Connect template in this case).
2. If you’re a member of the Office 365 Identity team, you can start an ICM by selecting the appropriate template from (https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/IcMsO365IdentityWorldwide/SitePages/Home.aspx) (Select the AAD Connect template in this case).
3. If you’re a member of a non-identity team, you should first create a collaboration task with either the Azure Identity team or the Office 365 Identity team (depending on whether you’re a member of an Azure team or a Modern Workplace team), to collect the necessary data and create an ICM if necessary. Make sure you fill in the template questions providing:
     1. A clear description (in your own words based out of your observation and troubleshooting performed) of the issue
     2. A comprehensive description of the troubleshooting already performed and its outcomes
     3. All the relevant application events, service logs, traces, etc including timestamps (preferable in UTC) for each repro time and relevant log.
4. Once the ICM required information is in the request, submit the ICM and contact your TA or SME to review it and approve by transferring it to the service team (in this case Azure Active Directory Connect / AADConnect – Customer Escalations)

# TCS7:Figure out the maximum throughput for the problem container

<br><br>
**1. Figure out the maixumum throughput for the problem container**

<br>++++++++++

<br>When you provision containers with shared database offering:

<br>Every 25 containers are grouped into a partition set and the database throughput(D) is shared between the containers in the partition set. 
<br><br>If there are up to 25 containers in the database and at any point of time, if you are using only one container, then that container can use a max of (D) throughput.
<br><br>For every new container created after 25 containers, a new partition set is created and the database throughput is split between the new partition sets created (that is D/2 for 2 partition sets, D/3 for 3 partition sets). 
<br><br>At any point of time, if you are using only one container from the database, it can use a max of (D/2, D/3, D/4 throughput) respectively. Given the reduced throughput, it is recommended that you create no more than 25 containers in one database.
<br><br>Please note that there is no throughput allocation or RU load balancing or fairness guarantees across collections

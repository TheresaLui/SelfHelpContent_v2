# Deploy Cosmos DB using ARM Template

## **Recommended documents**

The Azure Cosmos DB resources are classified namely  Account, Database,  Collection and so on.  
Please refer this "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-resources" for complete resource model.
The Database, Collection/Tales/graphs, Users, Permissions, documents/items/nodes/edges, attachments  resources types are all runtime
resources. You manage (CURD/query) these resources using SKDs and REST APIs. For instance, you can use any of the MongoDB client drivers to 
program against databases, collections, documents etc. Likewise, you can use a Gremlin clients to query/CRUD the graph, nodes and
edges and so on. All of the “runtime resources” can be accessed at low latency around the globe and are meant to  be used by the
developers directly inside their applications.

The only resource which is meant for administrative purposes is the “database account”. This resource is exposed via ARM.  Please refer
the Cosmos DB Template references from this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.documentdb/databaseaccounts

Please refer the below sample template for references.

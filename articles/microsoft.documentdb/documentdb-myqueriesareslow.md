# My queries are slow

## **Recommended steps**
To speed up queries, try one or more of the following steps.

* Whenever possible, avoid full scans on the collection. All user defined functions (UDFs) and built-in functions will scan across all documents within the query scope; for example, *SELECT * FROM c* will have a broader query scope than *SELECT * FROM c.foo = 'bar'*. To optimize performance, add a WHERE clause to your queries with UDFs and built-in functions to reduce the query scope.<br>[SQL query and SQL syntax in DocumentDB - Built-in functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-sql-query/#built-in-functions)<br>[SQL query and SQL syntax in DocumentDB - Where clause](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-sql-query/#where-clause)
* Use direct mode as your connection mode when configuring your connection policy.<br>[Performance tips for DocumentDB - Direct Connectivity](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-performance-tips/#direct-connection)
* Tune the page size for queries and read feeds for better performance using x-ms-max-item-count header.<br>[Performance tips for DocumentDB - Tune Page Size](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-performance-tips/#tune-page-size)
* For partitioned collections, query in parallel to increase performance and leverage more throughput.<br>[

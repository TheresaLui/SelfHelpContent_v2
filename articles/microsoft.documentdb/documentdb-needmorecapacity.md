# I need more storage/throughput

## **Recommended steps**
Try one of the following recommendations best fitting with your current scenario.

* I am using pre-defined performance collections (S1, S2, or S3) and would like to move to user-defined performance to set my storage and throughput options independently.
You can use the Portal to change the pricing tier to **STANDARD** by following these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-performance-levels/#changing-performance-levels-using-the-azure-portal)
* I am using single partition collections or pre-defined performance collections and would like to move to partitioned collections.
You can use the DocumentDB Data Migration Tool to migrate the data from the single-partition collection (S1, S2, S3, or Standard) to a partitioned collection by following these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-partition-data/#_migrating-from-single-partition-to-partitioned-collections)
* I am looking to just increase the throughput of my current collection.
You can use the Portal to change the throughput by following these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-performance-levels/#change-throughput)

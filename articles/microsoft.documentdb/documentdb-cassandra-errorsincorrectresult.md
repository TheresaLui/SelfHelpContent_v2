# Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API - Common errors

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Rate limiting errors**
Some of the queries including aggregations require a large amount of processing. If the collection's throughput is not enough, you will see these errors. You can confirm this by going to the **Metrics** blade and selecting the **Throughput** tab for your collection. You can review [Aggregate operations on Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API tables from Spark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-spark-aggregation-ops) to perform aggregate operations.

### **SSL Connection failure**
Azure Cosmos DB enforces strict security requirements and does require SSL for connection.

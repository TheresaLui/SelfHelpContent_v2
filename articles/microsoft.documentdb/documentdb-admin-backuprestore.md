# If you are requesting backup to configure disaster recovery

Azure Cosmos DB automatically backs up data to guard against regional failures or accidental deletion. If you're planning to capture backup or designing a strategy  to handle future disaster recovery, please enable a second geo-replicated region as it is provides the same advantage as backups. Please review [Distribute data globally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)

Please continue to file a Support Ticket if you need help restoring an accidentally deleted account/database/collection/document.

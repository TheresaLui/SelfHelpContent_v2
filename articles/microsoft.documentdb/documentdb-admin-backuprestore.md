# Requesting backups to test disaster recovery

Azure Cosmos DB automatically backs up your data to guard against regional failures or accidental deletion. If you're requesting a backup to test disaster recovery, please enable a second geo-replicated region which would provide the option for manual or automatic failover. For more details, please refer to this article: [Distribute data globally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally).

Please continue to file a support ticket if you need help to restore an accidentally deleted account, database, collection, or document.

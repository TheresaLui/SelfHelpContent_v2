# Backup and restore

* If you're requesting a restore to test disaster recovery, see [High availability with Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/high-availability). Cosmos DB supports [multi-region setups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-manage-database-account), which may preempt the need for backups.
* If you're looking to perform data movement or migration, we recommend using Azure Data Factory or the change feed library. See [Data migration in Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore#migrating-data-to-the-original-account).
* For details on the backup process, supported time windows and accidental deletions, and known limitations, see [Backup and restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore).

Continue to file a support ticket if you need help to restore an accidentally deleted account, database, collection, or document.

# Request for Backup to Configure Disaster recovery.

Cosmos DB automatically backs up data to guard against regional failures or accidental deletion. If you're looking for DR purposes, please enable a second geo-replicated region as it is provides the same advantage as backups. Please review [Distribute data Globally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)

Please continue to file a Support Ticket if you need help restoring an accidentally deleted account.

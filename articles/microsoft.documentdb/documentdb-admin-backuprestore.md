# If you are requesting backups to test disaster recovery

Azure Cosmos DB automatically backs up data to guard against regional failures or accidental deletion. If you're requesting backup to test disaster recovery, please enable a second geo-replicated region which would provide the option for manual or automatic failover. Please review [Distribute data globally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally)

Please continue to file a Support Ticket if you need help restoring an accidentally deleted account/database/collection/document.

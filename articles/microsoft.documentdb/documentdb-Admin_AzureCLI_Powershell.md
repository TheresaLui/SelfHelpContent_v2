# Unable to create collection with Unique Key from CLI

The Azure Cli does not have option to create collection with Unique Key yet.  We would be enchacing the cli command to include 
the Unique Key option in coming months.  However, for now you can use the Cosmos DB SDKs to create the collection with Unique Key. 
You can refer Collection Creation Sample(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/unique-keys#sql-api-sample)


## **Recommended documents**
Refer the [Unique keys in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/unique-keys)

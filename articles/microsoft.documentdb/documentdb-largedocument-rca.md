# We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue
<!--issueDescription-->
We found a high number of operations that are inserting or updating large documents.
<!--/issueDescription-->
Inserting or updating large documents requires many request units (RUs). If there are a large number of such operations, you might end up using most of your provisioned throughput. You may be able to make better use of your available RUs using the tips below.  

### Prefer smaller documents over larger documents
Writing a 1kb document = 5 RUs, 4kb document = 7 RUs, 64kb document = 48 RUs. Therefore, prefer smaller documents when possible. If your data can be subdivided into parts that are updated independently, consider breaking it up into smaller documents. 

Please see [Modeling 1-1, 1-N, and N-N for Cosmos DB](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v2/tree/master/samples/Patterns/Patterns/03.ManyToMany)

### Evaluate encoding non-queryable content
If there are properties/sections in your items that are not queried, but need to be globally distributed or accessed at low latency, e.g. binary content or free text, consider an encoding/compression to reduce their footprint and RU consumption.

### Evaluate hybrid storage for binary content
If there are properties/sections in your items that are not queried, and do not need to be globally distributed or accessed at low latency, consider moving them out to Blob Storage and store just the reference along with indexable metadata in Cosmos DB items.

### For data skews, consider the salting pattern
If there are some keys with an uneven access pattern (e.g. super-users of your website who have a lot of activity events), consider the salting pattern so that their data can be spread across multiple partitions. See [Handling large partition keys](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v2/tree/master/samples/Patterns/Patterns/07.LargePartitionKeys) for more details.

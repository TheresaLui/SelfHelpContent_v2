# Azure Stack Hardware Lifecycle Host

Azure Stack solutions from some hardware vendors include a Hardware Lifecycle Host (HLH), which is a computer outside Azure Stack that runs OEM vendor-provided management tools for hardware. Azure Stack hardware partners own and maintain guidance for all software and hardware on the hardware lifecycle host.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Refer to your OEM documentation for details on accessing and using the features of the hardware
2. When replacing Azure Stack hardware components, follow your vendor-specific firmware update process using the Hardware Lifecycle Hst to ensure the replaced hardware component has the approved firmware level applied

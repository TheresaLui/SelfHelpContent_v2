# Azure Stack network devices
The Azure Stack solution requires a resilient and highly available physical infrastructure to support its operation and services.<br>

The network infrastructure for Azure Stack consists of several logical networks that are configured on switches. These logical networks integrate with the top-of-rack (TOR), baseboard management controller (BMC), and border (customer network) switches.<br>

Additional troubleshooting and support information are available from the hardware vendor for the network switches included in your Azure Stack environment.

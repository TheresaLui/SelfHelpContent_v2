# Datacenter Networking Devices

The network infrastructure for Azure Stack Hub consists of several logical networks that are configured on physical switches. These logical networks integrate with the top-of-rack (TOR), baseboard management controller (BMC), and border (customer network) switches. For detailed steps that are specific to your Azure Stack Hub integrated system, refer to your hardware vendor's field replaceable unit (FRU) documentation.

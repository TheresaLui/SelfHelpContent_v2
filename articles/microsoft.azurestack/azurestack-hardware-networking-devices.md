# Azure Stack Network Devices
The Azure Stack solution requires a resilient and highly available physical infrastructure to support its operation and services.<br>

The network infrastructure for Azure Stack consists of several logical networks that are configured on physical switches. These logical networks integrate with the top-of-rack (TOR), baseboard management controller (BMC), and border (customer network) switches.<br>

See your hardware vendorâ€™s field replaceable unit (FRU) documentation for detailed steps that are specific to your Azure Stack integrated system.

# Azure Stack Network Devices

The network infrastructure for Azure Stack consists of several logical networks that are configured on physical switches. These logical networks integrate with the top-of-rack (TOR), baseboard management controller (BMC), and border (customer network) switches. For detailed steps that are specific to your Azure Stack integrated system, refer to your hardware vendorâ€™s field replaceable unit (FRU) documentation.

# Azure Stack marketplace
The Marketplace is a collection of services, applications, and resources customized for Azure Stack. Resources include networks, virtual machines, storage, and so on. Users come here to create new resources and deploy new applications. Think of it as a shopping catalog where users can browse and choose the items they want to use. To use a Marketplace item, users must subscribe to an offer that grants them access to the item.<br>

As an Azure Stack operator, you decide which items to add (publish) to the Marketplace. You can publish things like databases, App Services, and so on. Publishing makes them visible to all your users. You can publish custom items that you create. You can also publish items from a growing list of Azure Marketplace items. When you publish an item to the Marketplace, users can see it within five minutes.<br>

## **Recommended steps**

1. Register Azure Stack with Azure.
2. Download marketplace items from Azure to Azure Stack. 
3. Create and publish a Marketplace item of your own.

# Azure Stack hardware 

In the administrator portal, you can easily view the status of a scale unit and its associated nodes and how to use the available node actions. Node actions include power on, power off, drain, resume, and repair. Typically, you use these node actions during field replacement of parts, or for node recovery scenarios.<br>

## **Recommended steps**
To view the status of a scale unit:<br>

1. On the **Region Management** tile, select the **Region**
2. Under **Infrastructure Resources**, select **Scale Units**
3. In the results, select the **Scale Unit** to view the current status

See your vendorâ€™s field replaceable unit (FRU) documentation for detailed steps that are specific to your Azure Stack integrated system.

# Role-based access control in Azure Stack

User accounts are standard accounts that authenticate individuals by using a user ID and password. Groups can include users or other groups. How you create and manage users and groups depends on the identity solution you use - Azure AD or AD FS.

Azure Stack supports role-based access control (RBAC). You can use RBAC to manage user, group, or application access to subscriptions, resources, and services.

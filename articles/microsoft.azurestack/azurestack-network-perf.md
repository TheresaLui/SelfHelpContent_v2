# Azure Stack Network Performance or Packet Loss

The Azure Stack solution requires a resilient and highly available physical infrastructure to support its operation and services. Uplinks from ToR to Border switches are limited to SFP+ or SFP28 media and 1 GB, 10 GB, or 25 GB speeds. Check with your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) hardware vendor for availability.<br>

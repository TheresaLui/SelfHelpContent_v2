# Manage Plans in Azure Stack

Plans are groupings of one or more services. As a service provider, you can create plans to offer to your users. In turn, your users subscribe to your offers to use the plans and services they include. For example, you can create a plan that includes the compute, network, and storage resource providers.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. [Create a plan in Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-plan) to offer to your users
2. Optionally, create an [add-on plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/create-add-on-plan) to offer additional services or extend quotas beyond the base plan initial offer

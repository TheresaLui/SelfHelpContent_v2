# Manage subscriptions in Azure Stack

After you create an offer, users need a subscription to that offer before they can use it. There are two ways that users can get subscribed to an offer:

* As a cloud operator, you can create a subscription for a user from within the administrator portal. Subscriptions you create can be for both public and private offers.
* As a tenant user, you can subscribe to a public offer when you use the user portal.

## **Recommended steps**

1. To create a subscription as a cloud operator, see [Create a subscription as a cloud operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm#create-a-subscription-as-a-cloud-operator).
2. To create a subscription as cloud user, see [Create a subscription as a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm#create-a-subscription-as-a-user).

# Azure Stack OEM update management

Microsoft update packages for Azure Stack integrated systems typically release around the fourth Tuesday of each month. Ask your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) about their specific notification process to ensure update notifications reach your organization. You can also check in this documentation library under Overview > Release notes for information about releases that are in active support.

Your OEM hardware vendor will also release updates, such as driver and firmware updates. While these updates are delivered as separate packages by your OEM hardware vendor, they are imported, installed, and managed the same way update packages from Microsoft update packages are imported, installed, and managed.

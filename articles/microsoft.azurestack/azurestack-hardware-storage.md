# Azure Stack Storage Capacity

The hyper-converged configuration of Azure Stack allows for the sharing of physical storage devices. The three main divisions of the available storage are between:

* Infrastructure storage
* Tenant virtual machine storage
* Storage backing the blobs, tables, and queues of the Azure Consistent Storage (ACS) services

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Monitor the available storage and memory to ensure sufficient capacity is maintained
2. [Manage storage capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-manage-storage-shares#manage-available-spaces) to prevent the storage shares from running out of capacity, including:

    - Reclaim capacity from deleted VMs
    - Migrate a container between volumes

3. [Manage physical memory capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-manage-storage-physical-memory-capacity) to ensure there is enough for tenant VM deployments
4. To increase the total available memory capacity for Azure Stack, you can add additional memory to as a scale unit node by working with your hardware vendor (**Note:** All scale nodes that are members of a single scale unit must have the same amount of memory)

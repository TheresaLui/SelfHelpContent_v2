# Manage Azure Stack Offers

Offers are groups of one or more plans that providers present to users to buy or subscribe to.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To [Create an offer in Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-offer), sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal and select **Create a resource** > **Tenant Offers + Plans** > **Offer**
2. A tabbed user interface appears that enables you to define the offer name, and add existing or create new base plans and add-on plans
3. Optionally, create an [Azure Stack add-on plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/create-add-on-plan) to offer additional services or extend computer, storage, or network quotas beyond the base plan initial offer
4. Once offers are created, [create subscriptions to offers in Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm)

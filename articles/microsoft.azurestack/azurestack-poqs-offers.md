# Azure Stack Offers

As an Azure Stack operator, you can configure and deliver services in Azure Stack by using plans, offers, and quotas. Offers are groups of one or more plans that providers present to users to buy or subscribe to. This document shows you how to create an offer that includes the plan that you created. This offer gives subscribers the ability to set up virtual machines.

## **Recommended steps**

1. To create an offer, sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal and select + **Create a resource** > **Tenant Offers + Plans** > **Offer**. For detailed instructions see, [Create an offer in Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-offer).
2. To create subscribtions to offers, see [Create subscriptions to offers in Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm).

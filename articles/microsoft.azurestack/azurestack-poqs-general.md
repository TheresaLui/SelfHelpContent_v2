# Azure Stack Plans, Offers, Quotas and Subscriptions Overview

As an Azure Stack operator, you can configure and deliver services in Azure Stack by using plans, offers, and quotas.

## **Recommended steps**

1. Add an Azure Stack service that you want to deliver to your users.
2. Create a plan that has one or more services. When creating a plan, select or create quotas that define the resource limits of each service in the plan.
3. Create an offer that contains one or more plans. The offer can include base plans and optional add-on plans.

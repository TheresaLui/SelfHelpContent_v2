# Overview of Azure Stack Plans, Offers, Quotas and Subscriptions

As an Azure Stack operator, you can configure and deliver Azure Stack services to users by using plans, offers, and quotas.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Add an Azure Stack service that you want to deliver to your users
2. [Create a plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-plan) that has one or more services
3. While creating a plan, select or create [quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-quota-types) that define the resource limits of each service in the plan
4. [Create an offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-offer) that contains one or more plans, and can include base plans and optional add-on plans

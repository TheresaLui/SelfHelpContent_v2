# Azure Stack Hub Alerts

**Known Issue**

After applying the 2002 update, you might see a false-positive alert in the Administrator portal for an **Invalid Time Source**. The alert can be ignored and will be fixed in an upcoming release. For more information, see [Azure Stack Hub known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/operator/known-issues?view=azs-2002).  

## **Recommended Steps**

A critical alert should be addressed urgently because it can impact users. Please attempt the remediation steps in the alert before opening a case. In some alerts, you can select **Repair** in the Remediation details of the alert to resolve the issue. You can run the repair again if it fails.

# Azure Stack Marketplace delete

## **Recommended Steps**

* To verify and update all the Microsoft provided extensions and a set of core images for your Azure Stack, refer [Marketplace Management PowerShell Script](https://azurestack.blog/2018/12/marketplace-management-powershell-script/) and run the scripts
* To remove the Marketplace item, use the following command to first get the list of Marketplace items (you may want to filter those that have the **Publisher** of your VM image in the Marketplace item's name):

   `Get-AzureRMGalleryItem -ApiVersion 2015-04-01`

  From this list, select the Marketplace item for the VM Image that you are trying to delete and then run the following command:

   `Remove-AzureRMGalleryItem -ApiVersion 2015-04-01`

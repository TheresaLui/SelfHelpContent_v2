# Azure Stack System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) connectivity

The [System Center Management Pack for Microsoft Azure Stack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55184) enables you to monitor multiple Azure Stack deployments with a single Operations Manager instance. In addition to the OEM monitoring software that is provided on the hardware lifecycle host, you can also install vendor-specific management packs to monitor physical servers using SCOM. Operations Manager can also use network device discovery to monitor network switches used by Azure Stack.

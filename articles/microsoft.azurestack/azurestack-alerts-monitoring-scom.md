# Azure Stack System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) connectivity

The [System Center Management Pack for Microsoft Azure Stack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55184) enables you to monitor multiple Azure Stack regions with a single Operations Manager instance. You may also install vendor-specific management packs to monitor physical servers using SCOM, in addition to the OEM monitoring software that is provided on the hardware lifecycle host. Operations Manager can also use network device discovery to monitor the network devices used by Azure Stack.

# Have I been impacted by an Information Disclosure?

## We detected that information was not exposed

Microsoft was notified of and mitigated an issue that was the result of a misconfigured network security group’s security rules which enabled an internal database used for support case analytics to be accessible to the internet.<br>

Our analysis of the support information indicates that specific personal or organizational identifiable information related to your support case was potentially visible.<br>

<!--issueDescription-->
Our internal scans have not identified that your support case data associated with your tenant or subscription was within the potentially exposed support information.<br>
<!--/issueDescription-->

We are notifying impacted customers via an email sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) Global Admin(s), Technical Contact and or Account Admins and have notified affected subscriptions via [Service Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/). If you did not receive a notification from one of these channels, then you are not affected by this issue.<br>

If you are unsure, we recommend confirming with your **Global Admin** or **Tenant Contact** on your Tenant, or **Account Admin** on this subscription if they have been notified.<br>

We are committed to the privacy and security of your data and have taken the appropriate steps to promptly investigate and mitigate this issue.

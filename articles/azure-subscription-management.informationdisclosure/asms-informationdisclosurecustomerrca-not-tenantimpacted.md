## We detected that information was not exposed

<!--issueDescription-->
Microsoft was notified of and mitigated an issue that was the result of a misconfigured network security group’s security rules which enabled the customer support database to be accessible to the internet.<br>

We are notifying impacted customers via an email sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) Global Admin(s), Technical Contact and or Account Admins and have notified affected subscriptions via [Service Health](https://aka.ms/AzureSHAlerts). If you did not receive a notification from one of these channels, then you are not affected by this issue.<br>

If you are unsure, we recommend confirming with your **Global Admin** or **Tenant Contact** on your Tenant, or **Account Admin** on this subscription if they have been notified.<br>

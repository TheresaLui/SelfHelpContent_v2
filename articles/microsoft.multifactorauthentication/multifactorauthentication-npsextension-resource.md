# Installation errors for the Azure MFA NPS extension

## **Recommended steps** 
Follow these steps to troubleshoot common scenarios with the NPS Extension for Azure MFA: 

**ADAL token error**

1. Restart your NPS Server. 
2. Verify that the client cert is installed as expected. 
3. Verify that the certificate is associated with your tenant on AzureAD. 
4. Verify that https://login.windows.net/ is accessible from the server running the extension. 

**HTTP logs show user not found error**

1. Verify that AD Connect is running. 
2. Verify that the user is present in both Windows Active Directory and Azure Active Directory. The presence of a user is determined by the UPN or alternate login-Id. They should be in sync between On-Prem AD and Azure AD. 

**NoDefaultAuthenticationMethodIsConfigured and ProofDataNotFound**

1. Verify that the user has registered for Azure MFA and set up at least one verification method. 

**HTTP connect errors in logs and all auths are failing**

1. Verify that https://adnotifications.windowsazure.com is reachable from the server running the NPS extension.

# Why is my data not being automatically refreshed?

When a Data Consumer receives an invitation to a Data Share, they are offered the opportunity to subscribe to a scheduled refresh of this data. If they do not enable the scheduled refresh policy offered when accepting the invitation, data will not be automatically refreshed with incremental changes. Follow the below steps to resolve this issue.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Navigate to Azure Data Share -> Received Shares and select the share in question
* Click on the "Synchronization Settings" tab and select the checkbox for the refresh interval offered
* Click "Enable"

# Why is my data not being automatically refreshed?

When a Data Consumer receives an invitation to a Data Share, they are offered the opportunity to subscribe to a scheduled refresh of this data.

Follow the below steps to resolve this issue.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Navigate to Azure Data Share -> Received Shares and select the share in question
* Click on the "Synchronization Settings" tab and select the checkbox for the refresh interval offered
* Click "Enable"

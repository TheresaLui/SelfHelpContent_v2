# Why is my data not being automatically refreshed?

If you did not enable refresh policy, and try to enable it in the Sent Shares-> Share-> Setting screen, you not only need to enable the "Scheduled refresh" slider, but also need to click on the "Save" button right under Settings in order to save your changes.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Navigate to Azure Data Share -> Received Shares and select the share in question
* Click on the "Synchronization Settings" tab and select the checkbox for the refresh interval offered
* Click "Enable"

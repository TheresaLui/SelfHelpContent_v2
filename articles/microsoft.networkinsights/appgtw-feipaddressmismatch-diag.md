# Microsoft Azure has identified that your Application Gateway has a mismatched frontend IP address
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'** with the IP address in the URL **'<!--$UrlHost-->[UrlHost]<!--/$UrlHost-->'** does not match the **'<!--$FrontEndType-->[FrontEndType]<!--/$FrontEndType-->'** IP of the Frontend IP **'<!--$FrontEndIP-->[FrontEndIp]<!--/$FrontEndIp-->'**. This may be normal if a DNS CNAME or Azure Traffic Manager is being used to direct traffic to the Application Gateway IP address. 
<!--/issueDescription--> 
## **Steps to resolve**
If you are **NOT** using a DNS CNAME or Azure Traffic Manager, ensure that the host '<!--$UrlHost-->[UrlHost]<!--/$UrlHost-->' will eventually resolve to the IP '<!--$FrontEndIP-->[FrontEndIp]<!--/$FrontEndIp-->'.
To validate the host to IP resolution, do the following:

1. Open a command prompt
2. Type nslookup
3. Type the host '<!--$UrlHost-->[UrlHost]<!--/$UrlHost-->'
4. Validate the returned IP is your Application Gateway Frontend IP of '<!--$FrontEndIP-->[FrontEndIp]<!--/$FrontEndIp-->'
5. If it does not resolve to the correct IP, update your DNS registration at your registar

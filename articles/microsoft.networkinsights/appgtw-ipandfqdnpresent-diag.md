# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your Application Gateway's backend address pool

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway: **<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'s** backend address pool, **<!--$BackendAddressPool-->[BackendAddressPool]<!--/$BackendAddressPool-->**, contains IP Addresses and FQDNs. This could be an issue if the **<!--$BackendAddressPool-->[BackendAddressPool]<!--/$BackendAddressPool-->** is using HTTPS as the resources with IP addresses will fail due to a subject name mismatch when validating the SSL certificate.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to your Application Gateway **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'**
3. Go to the 'Backend pools' blade and choose **<!--$BackendAddressPool-->[BackendAddressPool]<!--/$BackendAddressPool-->**
4. Select the associated rule
5. Select the HTTP setting
6. If it is utilizing HTTPS, update the 'Host Name' field to have FQDNs so HTTPS will succeed

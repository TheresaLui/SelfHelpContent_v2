# Application Gateway Pick Host Name Not Set
<!--issueDescription-->
**'PickHostNameFromBackendAddress'** is not enabled on this Application Gateway. If the backend is a multi-tenant resource, such as, Azure Web Apps or App Service Environments, PickHostNameFromBackendAddress might need to be enabled if backend FQDN does not match with the host sent in the URL.

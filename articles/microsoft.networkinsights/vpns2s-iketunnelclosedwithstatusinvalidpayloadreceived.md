# Microsoft Azure has detected an IPsec/IKE issue on your VPN connection
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your VPN connection, **<!--$TunnelName-->[TunnelName]<!--/$TunnelName-->**, is disconnected because your Azure VPN gateway received invalid payload from your on-premises VPN device. You can ignore this warning if the VPN tunnel is connected and working right now, as it could recover automatically during the subsequent IKE negotiation.

## Recommended Steps

1. Verify the IPsec/IKE algorithms and parameters configured on your VPN device match the policies [supported by the Azure VPN gateways](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices#ipsec)

2. If there is no matching policy that works with your VPN device, or you need a specific algorithm or key strength due to compliance requirements, [configure a custom policy on the connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell)

3. If the connectivity issue persists, consult the instruction manual of your VPN device to check the logs for more detailed information

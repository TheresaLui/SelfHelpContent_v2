# Incorrect Username or Password
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that tunnel **<!--$TunnelName-->[TunnelName]<!--/$TunnelName-->** could not connect due to incorrect credentials at **<!--$preciseTimestamp-->[preciseTimestamp]<!--/$preciseTimestamp-->**.
## **Mitigation Steps**
If using login id and password, please check your credentials and try to connect again. 

If using certificates, make sure that the correct certificate is installed and used.

# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your Application Gateway authentication certificate
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway, **'<!--Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/Gatewayname-->'**, has an authentication certificate, **'<!--AuthCertificate-->[AuthCertName]<!--/AuthCertificate-->'** that is not valid before date: **<!--Timestamp-->[NotBefore]<!--/Timestamp-->**.  This certificate cannot be used for authentication until that date is reached.
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Steps to Update Expiring/Expired Certificates**
To resolve this issue upload a new 'Authentication Certificate' in the https listener blade in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or powershell, whichever you are more comfortable with. The step-by-step instructions are found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/renew-certificates).

# Your Load Balancer probes are blocked by a Network Security Group
<!--issueDescription-->
We have found that the  NSG **'<!--$NetworkSecurityGroupName-->[NetworkSecurityGroupName]<!--/$NetworkSecurityGroupName-->'** applied on your backend address pool **'<!--$AddressPoolName-->[AddressPoolName]<!--/$AddressPoolName-->'** for your loadbalancer **'<!--$LoadBalancerName-->[LoadBalancerName]<!--/$LoadBalancerName-->'** has a rule **'<!--$NetworkSecurityRuleName-->[NetworkSecurityRuleName]<!--/$NetworkSecurityRuleName-->'** that is **blocking the load balancer probe IP 168.63.129.16** to your backend address pool resources. This has caused your load balancer to mark the backend pool resources as unhealthy and remove them from rotation.
IP address **168.63.129.16** is the a virtual public IP address, which in this case enables monitoring probes from the Azure load balancer to determine health state for VMs in a load balanced set.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended steps**
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and browse to [Network Security Group blade](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FNetworkSecurityGroups)
2. Browse to your Network Security Group **'<!--$NetworkSecurityGroupName-->[NetworkSecurityGroupName]<!--/$NetworkSecurityGroupName-->'**
3. Add an Allow rule for IP address **168.63.129.16** that has a lower number (higher priority) than the Block rule
4. Save changes and check the Health Probe Status by going to Load Balancer Monitoring blade to view the backend pool health

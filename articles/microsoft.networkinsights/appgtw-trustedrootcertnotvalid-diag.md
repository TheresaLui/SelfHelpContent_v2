# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your Application Gateway trusted root certificate
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway, **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'**, has a trusted root certificate, **'<!--$AuthCertificate-->[AuthCertName]<!--/$AuthCertificate-->'** that is not valid before date: **<!--$Timestamp-->[NotBefore]<!--/$Timestamp-->**.  This certificate cannot be used for authentication until that date is reached.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve this issue upload a new 'Trusted Root Certificate' in the https listener blade in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or powershell, whichever you are more comfortable with. The step-by-step instructions are found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/renew-certificates).

# ExpressRoute Gateway Has undergone software upgrade
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your ExpressRoute gateway resource **[Gateway Name]** has undergone software upgrade within the last 30 days. The ExpressRoute gateway includes multiple instances, and one or more instances of your gateway resource is taken offline during update. Although this may cause your gateway to temporarily support lower network throughput to the virtual network, the gateway itself will not experience any downtime.

<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Steps to resolve this issue**
- If you experienced intermittent connectivity issues within the last 30 days, your gateway may be overused. Therefore, it cannot function correctly with one less instance. Consider [upgrading your gateway SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#gwsku) to support higher network throughput and maintain consistency in performance during OS maintenance. 
- If you experienced an outage within the last 30 days, please submit a support request in the Azure portal for more help.

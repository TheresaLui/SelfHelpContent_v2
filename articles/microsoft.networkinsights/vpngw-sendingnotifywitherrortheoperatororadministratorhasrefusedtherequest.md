# VPN Tunnel Connection Was Disconnected
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that tunnel {TunnelId} was disconnected because the gateway received a connect request on an alreading connecting/connected state tunnel or the Connection request was received on a secondary gateway instance.<!--/$preciseTimestamp-->**.
## **Mitigation Steps**
If the tunnel reconnects in a few minutes then no action is necessary, otherwise try [resetting the gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-resetgw-classic).

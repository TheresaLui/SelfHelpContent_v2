# Microsoft Azure is unable to automatically validate your Public Prefix
<!--/issueDescription-->
Peering for ExpressRoute requires customer-supplied public prefixes are verified against a registrar, such as ARIN.  This is a standard practice to verify identity and ownership of IP address space.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* This likely failed due to the **OriginAS** property being null at the registry
* To avoid this issue in the future, please consider updating your organization information at the registry so the OriginAS is populated with an appropriate ASN

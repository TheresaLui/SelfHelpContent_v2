# Microsoft Azure had identified that your Application Gateway is missing an trusted root certificate
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway: **<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->** has a backend Http setting **<!--$BackendHttpSettingName-->[BackendHttpSettingsName]<!--/$BackendHttpSettingName-->** of protocol HTTPS and has no Trusted Root Certificate configured. **If the backend is an Azure WebApp, this configuration is correct and no action is required.**
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* If backend server is not an Azure Web App, the trusted root certificate for backend server must be white-listed. Read more on [how to whitelist certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-backend-ssl#end-to-end-ssl-and-whitelisting-of-certificates).

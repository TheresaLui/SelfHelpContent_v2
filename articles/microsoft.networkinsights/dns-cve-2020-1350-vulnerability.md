## **Recommended Steps**

If you are hosting DNS zones on Azure DNS no action is required.

However, if you are running Windows-based DNS servers as custom DNS in your virtual network, you must patch these servers.

Please note, this vulnerability impacts only devices running Windows DNS servers and is not applicable if you are running non-Windows DNS servers  (e.g. BIND, etc.) in your virtual networks.

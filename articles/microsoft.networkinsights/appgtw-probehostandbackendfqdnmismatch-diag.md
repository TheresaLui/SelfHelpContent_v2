# Application Gateway Health Probe FQDN Mismatch
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that the Host listed for Health Probe **<!--$ProbeHost-->[ProbeHost]<!--/$ProbeHost-->** does not match the FQDN for the Backend pool resources. With this mismatch the health probe from the Application Gateway will not reach the backend pool resources which will mark the backend pool resrouces as unhealthy causing them to be removed from load-balanced rotation breaking your solution.
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Steps to resolve the issue**

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Browse to your Application Gateway
3. Go to the 'Backend pools' blade and select the backend pool you want for Health Probe **<!--$ProbeHost-->[ProbeHost]<!--/$ProbeHost-->**.
4. Make note of the FQDN used and close the blade.
5. Go to the 'Health Probes' blade and select **<!--$ProbeHost-->[ProbeHost]<!--/$ProbeHost-->**.
6. Update the 'Host' field with the FQDN from step #4 above.

# Microsoft IPv4 Peering Prefixes are not Advertised
This is likely failing due to missing route filters <br>

Many services are accessible through peering configured on an Express Route circuit.  The prefixes related to those services are advertised through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session that are established.  A BGP community value is attached to every prefix to identify the service that is offered through the prefix.  <br> 
<br>
When peering is configured on your ExpressRoute circuit, the Microsoft edge routers establish a pair of BGP sessions with the edge routers (yours or your connectivity provider's). No routes are advertised to your network. <br> 
<br>
To enable route advertisements to your network, you must associate a route filter.<br>
<br>
A route filter lets you identify services you want to consume through your ExpressRoute circuit's Microsoft peering. It is essentially a white list of all the BGP community values. <br> 
<br>
Once a route filter resource is defined and attached to an ExpressRoute circuit, all prefixes that map to the BGP community values are advertised to your network.
 
## **Recommended steps**
Please check for/create route filters that you wish to consume <br>
Once route filters are created, prefixes should populate from the Microsoft edge to the your device.

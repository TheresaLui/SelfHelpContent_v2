# We have detected a potential issue with a path-based rule configured on your Application Gateway

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected a potential issue with a path-based routing rule configured on your Application Gateway.
<!--/issueDescription-->

- **Application Gateway:** <!--$GatewayName-->Application Gateway<!--/$GatewayName-->
- **Rule Name:** <!--$RuleName-->Rule Name<!--/$RuleName-->
- **URL Path:** <!--$UrlPath-->URL Path<!--/$UrlPath-->
- **URL Path Map Name:** <!--$UrlPathMapName-->URL Path Map Name<!--/$UrlPathMapName-->

Typically, when we utilize a path-based routing rule, we expect to utilize URLs that will match to a path in the map.  However, URL (<!--$UrlPath-->URL Path<!--/$UrlPath-->) did not match any paths in the map.  When no match is found, Application Gateway uses the default path configured on the routing rule.

If you experience path-routing issues, review the URL path map (<!--$UrlPathMapName-->URL Path Map Name<!--/$UrlPathMapName-->) configuration for your routing rule (<!--$RuleName-->Rule Name<!--/$RuleName-->).

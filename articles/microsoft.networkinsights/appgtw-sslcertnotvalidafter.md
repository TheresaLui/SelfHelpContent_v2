# Microsoft Azure has identified an issue with your Application Gateway authentication certificate
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Application Gateway, **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'**, has an authentication certificate, **'<!--$AuthCertificate-->[AuthCertName]<!--/$AuthCertificate-->'** that is not valid after date: **<!--$Timestamp-->[NotAfter]<!--/$Timestamp-->**.  This certificate cannot be used for authentication as that date has been reached.
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve this issue upload a new 'Authentication Certificate' in the Listeners blade for your HTTPS listener in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) for your Application Gateway or PowerShell, whichever you are more comfortable with. The step-by-step instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/renew-certificates).

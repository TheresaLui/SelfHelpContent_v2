# Express Route Circuit De-provisioning Incomplete
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified a platform configuration issue for your private peering ExpressRoute connection named **<!--$CircuitName-->[CircuitName]<!--/$CircuitName-->** that uses service key: **<!--$ServiceKey-->[ServiceKey]<!--/$ServiceKey-->**. The initial diagnosis is that the service provider has not updated the status to reflect that it has been decommissioned. See below for steps to resolve the issue.
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Steps to resolve this issue**
**Note:** The following steps will resolve the issue by decommissioning the Express Route Circuit.

1. Ask the circuit service provider to confirm when they used the Azure API to deprovision the circuit.
2. If they did not do so previously, do it now.
2. Once the circuit service provider has updated the status, you should be able to remove the circuit from your subscription.

## We ran diagnostics on your VM instance and found an issue. 

The VM with ID {VmId}, of version {VmVersion}, does not have the network drivers necessary to support Accelerated Networking on Azure's latest ConnectX-4 hardware. This may impact performance. Our partners have updated their Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) images to work with the latest hardware, and have published the updated images to Azure Marketplace. 

We are continuously working on improving the platform and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused to you.

## **Recommended Steps**

To avoid any impact to your current deployments, please upgrade your VM to the latest version in Azure Marketplace. Older VM versions are not affected.

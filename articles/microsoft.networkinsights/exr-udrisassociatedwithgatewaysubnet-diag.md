# ExpressRoute Gateway Subnet Has UDR Applied
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your gateway subnet for virtual network ID **<!--$VNetId-->[VNetId]<!--/$VNetId--> has the following user-defined route (UDR) associated: **<!--$UDRName-->[UDRName]<!--/$UDRName-->**. If the UDR has not been carefully configured you will experience connectivity issues to/from your virutal network resources or on-premises resources.
<!--/issueDescription-->
## **Steps to resolve the issue**

1. Use Network Watcher [Next Hop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/diagnose-vm-network-routing-problem) to verify if the subnet next hop is expected.
2. Remove the route and test traffic flows

# VPN Tunnel Connection Was Disconnected
<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that tunnel {TunnelId} was disconnected because the Gateway received a connection request on a tunnel that is already in connecting/connected state or the connection request was received on a secondary gateway instance. 
## **Mitigation Steps**
If the tunnel reconnects in a few minutes then no action is necessary, otherwise try [resetting the gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-resetgw-classic).

# Application Gateway Missing HTTP Listener
<!--issueDescription-->
We have found that your Application Gateway **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'** has no HttpListeners with LoadBalancingRules associated. The Application Gateway will not function until at least one HttpListener has LoadBalancingRules associated.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Browse to your Application Gateway **'<!--$Gatewayname-->[GatewayName]<!--/$Gatewayname-->'**
3. Click on the "Listeners" blade
4. Select the Listener you wish to use or create one if you do not have one listed
5. Associate a LoadBalancingRule with the Listener from step #4

# We have detected a potential issue with a path-based rule configured on your Application Gateway

<!--issueDescription-->
We have detected a potential issue with a path-based routing rule configured on your Application Gateway.
<!--/issueDescription-->

- **Application Gateway:** <!--$GatewayName-->Application Gateway<!--/$GatewayName-->

A rule exists for path **<!--$Path-->Path<!--/$Path-->**, however the Application Gateway URL provided upon creation of your support request contains path **<!--$UrlPath-->UrlPath<!--/$UrlPath-->**.

The presence of a trailing slash (/) in your path may cause undesired path routing.

If you experience path-routing issues, try removing the trailing slash from your path-based rule.

# Check what is reason for the request malformed category

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

Altough, native MongoDB support the quotation mark in the NumberLong(): [Data Types](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/shell-types/), Cosmos DB MongoDB API currentntly doesn't support quotation mark in NumberLong(). Until quotation mark is supported in NumberLong() by Cosmos DB, we recommend you to remove them, insert should then succeed.

Thank you.

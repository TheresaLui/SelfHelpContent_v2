# Disabe Multi-region write feature issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Dear customer,

The Multi-region Write or Multi Master feature is an option which can be enabled during the Cosmos DB Account Creation work flow in the Azure Portal. 

##What is the default setting of Multi-region Write feature during Azure Cosmos DB Account Creation
The Multi-region Write feature is disabled by default in both the Portal and the Azure CLI. The setting option have to be enabled by the end user explicitly.

##How to Disable Azure Cosmos DB Multi-region Write feature from existing  Azure Cosmos DB Account?
The option to disable multi region write is available in the Azure Portal. Go to your Cosmos DB account > Replicate data globally > In the **Configure regions** select **Disable**.

You can also run the below azure CLI command to disable the Multi-region Write feature on an existing Cosmos DB Account, as an example:
```
az cosmosdb update  --name <database_name>  --resource-group <resource_group>  --enable-multiple-write-locations false 
```

**Note:** this should be executed in the Cloud Shell or if local, the latest version of Azure CLI.

## **Recommended Steps**

The error returned usually means that the login attempt was made using a **contained user** that exists, the database is correct, but the **password is invalid**.   
This can also happen if you use a SQL login to connect to a contained database that has a contained user with the same name but a different password.   
To resolve this issue, contact your service administrator for valid credentials.

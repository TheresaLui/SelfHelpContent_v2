# Fails across multiple backend clients at the same time issue

<!--issueDescription-->

Loop in Azure Networking to look for a cause

##Customer message:
Dear customer

The failure happens across multiple backend clients at the same time, this is an indicative of an issue not in the SDK, but between the SDK and the backend service. We are going to loop in Azure Networking to look for a cause. 

Also please let us know if you are using any Proxies/VNET firewall applicances/etc. that could cause issues.

Thanko you.

# Issue Category

1- Get the Database Account Name and review the Cosmos DB Account SLA
2- Walkthrough through Service Unavailable Workflow using the this [chart](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/anferrei_microsoft_com/EagdtKHKpw9AiWm9E1PXercBhfqq9Fg1koKXuYsIJRJe2w?e=2Fz7AF)

Customers may face variety of Availability issues such as:
1. DNS Resolution Failure
2. Availability SLA Violated
3. Gateway Mode Offline
4. Endpoint Offline
5. Java/.Net (Gone exceptions, Timeout, etc.)

##Is DNS Resolution Failure?
1. Collect the Complete Error and Exceptions Stack
2. If the Error  *"The remote name could not be resolved. Since, the issue is with networking and DNS"* then DNS Resolution Issue

##Is Cosmos DB Availability SLA Violated?
1. The Azure portal does show the Availability SLA for the given Account.  The customer should be able to check any availability issue in the portal to confirm any service issue.   The Azure Portal basically uses the "ComsosDBAccountAvailability"
2. Metric to display the chart for customers which we can query through Jarvis. https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/dashboard/DocumentDB/SLA. 
3. The availability is down if the chart show any drop.

**Example :** No SLA Violation

##Is Gateway Mode?
Ensure we get the complete Call Stack as show below.   The class "Microsoft.Azure.Documents.GatewayStoreModel" indicates the connection is using Gateway Mode.  Also, you can get the connection mode from Customer.

##Is Endpoint Online

### NetworkConnectivityWatchdog

#### Overview

A NetworkConnectivityWatchdog now continuously monitors the health of each endpoint of master and server processes.  The NetworkConnectivityWatchdog  probes the endpoint in regular frequency as stated below. The watchdog log can be used to evaluate the status of the endpoint precisely.

There are two types of probes.

##### ConnectProber 

> Networkwatchdog  creates a new connection, negotiates SSL, sends a request and validates the response.

> It probes every 60 seconds

##### RequestProber

> Networkwatchdog uses the existing connection to send a request and validates the response

> It probes every 10 seconds



**Probe Logs telemetry in the Kusto table InstanceEndpointHealthEventG**



#### How to check the Health status of the Endpoint

##### If customer provided exception contains port number

> Extract timestamp, tenant, and port number. Run the following query.

**Guidance to Customer for troubleshooting Client Side issue**

1.  If SDK < 2.3.2 and customer complains of service unavailable, we suggest upgrading SDK

2.  If the client CPU > 80% we point that as the root cause.

**Guidance to Customer for troubleshooting Client Side issue**

1.  If SDK < 2.3.2 and customer complains of service unavailable, we suggest upgrading SDK

2.  If the client CPU > 80% we point that as the root cause.

<br>

##(Java/.NET Only) Has the customer tried the public troubleshooting guide?

##Java Troubleshooting Guide

Have customer follow these steps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-java-async-sdk

If no, point it out to them that it can help them troubleshoot on their own in the future, but you can walk through the steps below.

**Is it failing across multiple backend clients at the same time?**   

 **If yes**. This is indicative of an issue not in the SDK, but between the SDK and the backend service. If you've checked for backend service issues, then it's worth looping in Azure Networking to look for a cause. Also ask whether they are using any Proxies/VNET firewall applicances/etc. that could cause issues.

 **If no**, check for issues in the client environment:

* Majority of our Client are getting the "Service Unavailable" Exception is due to High CPU on the Client Environment. Also, ensure the CPU usage are monitored in 5 second interval.  Anything greater than 5 seconds interval does not reveal High CPU usage.
* Small Subset of issue were due to Client Side Network Issue

a. No connections successful at all?
Check local port firewalls - Direct requires a lot of opened Ports/IP Addresses to be exposed

b. Some failing at first, then more and more failing?
SNAT issues - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-dot-net-sdk#snat

c. Just intermittent connectivity issues

Run 'netstat' and look for number of requests in TIME_WAIT state. Can indicate we're closing connections too much, which will exhaust the connection pool. Solution is to increase connection pool size (and file descriptors to make sure we can actually open more sockets) (or to scale out to limit requests per client sdk if they can't control connection pool size (like app service)).
Tools to Suggest is to User Perfmon if its On-premise environment
Engage the Azure respective services if the application is running in Azure Platform

 

##For Gone Exceptions, check if Role Instance is changing in below  query.. You will find partition Id, Tenant and replicaid in error stack

Example:

``

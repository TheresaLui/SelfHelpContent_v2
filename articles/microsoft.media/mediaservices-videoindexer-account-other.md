## Invite users to Video Indexer

To collaborate with your colleagues, you can [invite them to your Video Indexer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/invite-users) by adding their email addresses. 

## Video Indexer failover and disaster recovery

Azure Media Services Video Indexer doesn't provide instant failover of the service if there's a regional datacenter outage or failure. [Learn how to configure your environment for a failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-disaster-recovery) to ensure optimal availability for apps and minimized recovery time if a disaster occurs. We recommend that you configure business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR) across regional pairs to benefit from Azure's isolation and availability policies.

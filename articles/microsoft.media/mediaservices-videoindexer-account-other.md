# Video Indexer failover and disaster recovery

Azure Media Services Video Indexer doesn't provide instant failover of the service if there's a regional datacenter outage or failure. Learn how to configure your environment for a failover to ensure optimal availability for apps and minimized recovery time if a disaster occurs. We recommend that you configure business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR) across regional pairs to benefit from Azure's isolation and availability policies.

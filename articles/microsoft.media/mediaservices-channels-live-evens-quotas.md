# Manage quotas of Channels or Live Events

There is a default (soft) limit of 5 live Channels (v2) and Live Events (v3) per Media Services account. You can open a support ticket to increase this quota. Make sure to include detailed information in the request on the desired quota changes, including your region and scale information.

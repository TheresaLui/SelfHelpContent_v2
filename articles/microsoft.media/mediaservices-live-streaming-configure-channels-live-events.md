# How to configure live streaming?

## **Recommended Documents**

**Supported live encoders to use with Media Services**

If you are having an issue with live encoding, please test with one of the recommended encoder configurations for Azure Media Services first before filing a support ticket. 

* [Recommended live encoders to use with Media Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/recommended-on-premises-live-encoders)

**Using Live Events in the v3 API**

**NOTE**: Currently, you cannot use the Azure portal to manage v3 resources. Use the [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref), [CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref), or one of the supported [SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/developers-guide).

It is recommended to first read the [Overview of live streaming with the v3 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/live-streaming-overview)

* [Tutorial: Stream live with v3 API and .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/stream-live-tutorial-with-api)

**Using Channels in the v2 API (legacy)**

It is recommended to first read the [Live Streaming using Azure Media Services Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-manage-channels-overview/)

The following articles show how to configure live streaming.

* [Working with Channels that Receive Multi-bitrate Live Stream from On-premises Encoders](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-live-streaming-with-onprem-encoders)
* [Live streaming using Azure Media Services cloud encoder](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-manage-live-encoder-enabled-channels)

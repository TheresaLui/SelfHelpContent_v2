# Azure Media Services analyzing with the OCR processor (v2 legacy)

The Azure Media OCR Processor available in the V2 (legacy) API and is  used to extract text from the visible text in a video file. 

Media Services also has an improved and [new set of OCR capabilities in the v3 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/analyzing-video-audio-files-concept) called Video Analyzer that replace the legacy OCR processor. 

### Should I use OCR processor in v2 (legacy) API or the Video Analyzer in v3?

It is recommmended to move to the [v3 API's Video Analyzer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/analyzing-video-audio-files-concept) which has an updated OCR processor and includes better performance. 

Also, you may consider consuming the [Video Indexer APIs](http://video.ai) if you need more advanced video AI capabilities and an integrated portal and search experience.

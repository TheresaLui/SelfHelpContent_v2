# Azure Media Player closed captions and subtitles

At this time, Azure Media Player currently supports captions for only On Demand events with WebVTT format and live events using CEA-708 pass-through. IMSC1/TTML format is currently unsupported. Captions and subtitles allow the player to cater to and empower a broader audience, including people with hearing disabilities or those who want to read along in a different language. Captions also increase video engagement, improve comprehension, and make it possible to view the video in sound sensitive environments, like a workplace.

### **Sample WebVTT Subtitles in Azure Media Player**

Please review [this sample of using WebVTT](https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/samples/dynamic_webvtt.html) subtitles with Azure Media Player. 

### **Live captions with 608/708 pass-through**

Please review [this sample showing live captions with 608/708 passthrough](https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/samples/dynamic_live_captions.html)

Your upstream live encoder must be capable of pre-inserting CEA-708 and 608 captions into the video stream. If captions are detected in the video stream, they will be preserved.

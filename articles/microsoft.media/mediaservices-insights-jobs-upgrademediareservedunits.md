# Upgrade the type of reserved units

<!--issueDescription-->
Our internal service telemetry detected that some Jobs in your Azure Media Services account **<!--$accountName--> accountName <!--/$accountName-->** could have lower processing times. Azure Media Services gives you the ability to control the speed at which your jobs run. If you would like to have better processing speed, you can configure your account to have Media Reserved Units of type S3.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* To improve processing speed, change the type of Media Reserved Units to S3 via the portal or v2 API

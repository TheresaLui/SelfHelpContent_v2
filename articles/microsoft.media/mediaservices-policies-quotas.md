# Manage access policies quotas

You should try to design a limited set of policies in your Media Services account and reuse them when possible.

In Media Services v3, **Streaming Policies** have a default (soft) limit of 100. You should try to reuse them for your **Streaming Locators** whenever the same encryption options and protocols are needed.  

In Media Services v2 (legacy), there is a default limit of 1,000,000 policies for different policies (for example, for Locator policy or ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicy). You should use the same policy ID if you are always using the same days / access permissions, for example, policies for locators that are intended to remain in place for a long time (non-upload policies).

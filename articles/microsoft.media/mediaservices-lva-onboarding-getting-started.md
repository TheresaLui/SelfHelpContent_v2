# Onboarding and getting started

Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge provides a platform to build intelligent video applications that span the edge and the cloud. The platform offers the capability to capture, record, and analyze live video along with publishing the results (video and/or video analytics) to Azure services (in the cloud and/or the edge).

IoT solutions that combine video analytics with signals from other IoT sensors and/or business data can help you automate or semi-automate business decisions, resulting in productivity improvements. Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge enables you to build such solutions quicker. You can focus on building the video analysis modules and logic that is specific to your business, and letting the platform hide the complexities of managing and running a video pipeline.

With Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge, you can continue to use your CCTV cameras with your existing video management systems (VMS) and build video analytics apps independently. Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge can be used in conjunction with computer vision SDKs and toolkits to build cutting edge IoT solutions. The diagram below illustrates this.

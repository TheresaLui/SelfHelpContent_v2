# Manage Azure Media Services quotas

There are quotas and limitations associated with an Azure Media Services account. Some limits are fixed, in which case they cannot be increased. To obtain higher limits for resources that are not fixed, do **not** create additional Media Services accounts. Instead, open a [support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) and include detailed information in the request on the desired quota changes, use-case scenarios, and regions required.

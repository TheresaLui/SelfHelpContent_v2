**Data Migration Tools available on Mac OS**

1. **AzCopy v10**: AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for copying data to/from Microsoft Azure Blob, File, and Table storage, using simple commands designed for optimal performance. 

<!---
You can copy data between a file system and a storage account, or between storage accounts. 

You can upload, download, copy files concurrently & the biggest advantage you get is, it can resume interrupted operations. It doesn't offer any GUI to play with. 

That means there is a slight learning curve for all those GUI people.

2. **Azure Storage Explorer**: Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone app that makes it easy to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 


3. **Azure CLI**: Azure CLI is an open source, cross platform set of tools for different azure services.

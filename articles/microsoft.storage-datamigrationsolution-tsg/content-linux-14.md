**Data Migration Tools available on Linux OS**


1. **AzCopy v10**: AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for copying data to/from Microsoft Azure Blob, File, and Table storage, using simple commands designed for optimal performance. 

<!---
You can copy data between a file system and a storage account, or between storage accounts. 

You can upload, download, copy files concurrently & the biggest advantage you get is, it can resume interrupted operations. It doesn't offer any GUI to play with. 

That means there is a slight learning curve for all those GUI people.

2. **Azure CLI**: Azure CLI is an open source, cross platform set of tools for different azure services. 

3. **Other tools**: 
   
   ***AzCopy v7*** - Copy blobs in Blob storage (*Obsolete/Not Recommended*).
    This version is for backward compatibility and not supported by Microsoft.

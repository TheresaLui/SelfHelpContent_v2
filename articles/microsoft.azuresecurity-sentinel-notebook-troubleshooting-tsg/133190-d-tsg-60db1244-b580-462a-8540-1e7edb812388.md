# Missing Module Install

Before you can use a module in a notebook you must first install it in the notebook environment. If you attempt to import a module and receive a ModuleNotFoundError it is likely because the module is not installed. If running an Azure Sentinel Notebook you may also see this warning as an output to the setup cell. 

How to resolve:
- Install the required module. The easiest way to do this is to add a code cell to the notebook and enter:
		!pip install MODULE_NAME
- Running this cell will install the module listed. Once complete you can attempt the import again.

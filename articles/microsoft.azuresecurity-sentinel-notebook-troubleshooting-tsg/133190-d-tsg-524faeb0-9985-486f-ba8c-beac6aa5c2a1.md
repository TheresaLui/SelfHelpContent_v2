# Query Results are not as Expected

If you run a query and the results returned are not as expected, for example the returned results set is empty or expected data is missing you may have an issue with the query syntax. 
How to resolve:
- You can print out the query that is being run if using the MSTICpy QueryProvider’s pre-built queries. To do this add “print” as the first parameter when calling a query, this will then return a string of the query including any parameter substitution. 
	query = qry_prov.Azure.list_all_signins_geo(“print”, start=start, end=end)
	print(query)
You can then debug the query in place or copy and paste the query to the Azure Sentinel UI to review results.

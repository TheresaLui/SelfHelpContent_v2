# Variable Does Not Exist

If you restart a kernel part way through a notebook, or if you don’t run the cells in order you may end up running a cell that references a value that you have not yet set. If this occurs you will get a NameError and a message stating that the variable name is not defined.

How to resolve:
- Find the cell where the missing variable is set. You can do this by searching the notebook for ‘x=’ where x is the name of the missing variable.
- Run the cell where the variable is set and then try re-running the cell with the issue.
- If the problem persists, consider setting a holding value for the variable at the top of the cell where the error occurs. For example, x = None. (Note this may cause further errors)

# Query Data Error

If a query to Azure Sentinel fails, the results set will not be returned and instead the results will be set to the value of ‘None’. If you then try and interact with the results as if they were valid data, you will get an attribute error.
 

How to resolve:
- Re-run the cell where the data query is made to see if results are returned.
- Try making the time window of the query smaller, as it is possible the query timed out.
Follow the steps to troubleshoot ‘Query Results are not as Expected’.

# Running Cell Produces no Output

There are a number of reasons that a cell will produce no output when run.
How to resolve:
- Check the notebook has an attached kernel by looking in the top right hand corner of the notebook. If it reads ‘No Kernel’ select Kernel > Change Kernel from the menu and pick a kernel.
		
- Check the cell has output, not all do. If there is no display or print statements, or if there is no unassigned output in the cell then it’s possible no output is expected.

- Check the kernel has completed executing the cell. You can tell if it is executing by looking at the circle next to the kernel name, if it’s filled the kernel is busy. If the kernel remains busy for an extended period of time its possible the kernel has hung, you can resolve this by restarting the kernel.

For MS apps use the template: <br>
Dear customer, <br>
<br>
At this point, it seems that the Missing/Inaccurate values is on source app. We will route the case to concern team, and they will get in touch with you to continue troubleshooting.<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
<br>
For 3rd party app (Gsuite/Box/etc..) use the template: <br>
Dear customer, <br>
<br>
It seems that the Missing/Inaccurate values is on the 3rd party app end. Please open a ticket for their support team for further investigation.<br>
Best regards,<br>

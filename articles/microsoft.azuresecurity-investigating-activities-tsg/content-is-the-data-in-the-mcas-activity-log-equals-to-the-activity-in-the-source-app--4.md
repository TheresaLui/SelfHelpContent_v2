# Check if the data in the MCAS activity log equals to the activity in the source app

1. Please have the customer export the raw data from the activity in MCAS activity log, and compare it to the activity in the source app, and see if there's any difference. 
2. For example O365 SCC audit logs/AAD Signin log.

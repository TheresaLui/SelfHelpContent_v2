# Check if the connector connected successfully

1. Please check the status of the app connector that the activities is missing for under Investigate > Connected Apps > App Connectors.
2. The status should be Connected and the timestamp in the Last Activity column should be recent. 
3. If the status is something other than Connected, click on it and use the Test Now button to check (not all connectors have this button)

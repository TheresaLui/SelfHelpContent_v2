# I'm having a problem with governance remediation for anomaly detection alerts

Most users are able to resolve governance issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check if your IP ranges are properly configured, as many detections are impacted by IP ranges and tags. For more information, see [Working with IP ranges and tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/ip-tags).
1. Use the [Anomaly detection alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/investigate-anomaly-alerts) guide for detailed remediation steps.
1. Implement custom automatic remediation actions using [Microsoft Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/flow-integration).

## **Recommended Documents**

- [Use the Cloud App Security REST API for remediation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/api-introduction)
- [Investigate activities using the API](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/investigate-activities-api)

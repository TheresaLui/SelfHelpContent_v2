# I'm having a problem with configuring access controls for native apps

Access controls can be used to monitor or block access to a native app. Session controls are only supported for web-based apps.

Most users are able to resolve the following issues using the steps below:

- I am not able to login to my native app
- My native app is not recognized
- I cannot configure controls for my native app

## **Recommended Steps**

- Make sure that you are enforcing access controls and not session controls

**NOTE**: Access controls can be enforced on native apps. Session controls can only be enforced on web-based apps.

- If you are unable to block access to your native app, in your access policy, set the **Client app filter** to **Mobile** and **Desktop**. If this is not set, the resulting policy will only apply to browser sessions.
- Validate your sign in flow by downloading the Azure AD sign-in logs in the JSON file format. If you proceed to open the support case, make sure you include the file with the ticket.

**NOTE**: The Authenticator app, among other native client app sign-in flows, uses a non-interactive sign-in flow and cannot be used with access controls.

## **Recommended Documents**

- [Supported Apps and Clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad#supported-apps-and-clients)
- [Access policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/access-policy-aad)

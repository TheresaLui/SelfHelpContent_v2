# I have a question about my Cloud App Security license

Most users are able to address licensing questions using the information below.

## **Recommended Documents**

**What license do I need to use Cloud App Security?**

Microsoft Cloud App Security can be licensed as a standalone product or as part of several different licensing bundles. Use the following references to determine which license is best suited to your needs:

- Compare between [Cloud App Security and Office 365 Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/editions-cloud-app-security-o365)
- Compare between [Cloud App Security and Cloud App Discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/editions-cloud-app-security-aad)

For details about the different licenses, see the [licensing datasheet](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2NXYO).

**Which license bundle of Cloud App Security am I using?**

In order to understand which license bundle of Cloud App Security you're using, look at the headline title of your portal. It can be one of the following:
 - Microsoft Cloud App Security
 - Office 365 Cloud App Security
 - Cloud App Discovery

**Who needs a license to use Cloud App Security?**

The Cloud App Security license applies at the tenant level. Each user must be licensed for Cloud App Security to use or benefit from the service. For customers who license a subset of users, services enforced at the tenant level are not licensed for the other users of the tenant. For more information, see the [licensing datasheet](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2NXYO).

**What license do I need to make API calls?**

The Cloud App Security license applies at the tenant level and includes the use of the API. Therefore, once you have access to the Cloud App Security portal, you can also make API calls. Learn more about using the [API](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/api-introduction).

# Issues with Discovery integrations (Zscaler, iboss, Corrata)

Refer to the section that best describes your integration issue.


## **Zscaler integration issues**

1. Verify that the Zscaler integration is correctly configured. Follow steps in [Integrate Cloud App Security with Zscaler](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/zscaler-integration).

1. If no discovered apps are available, in Cloud App Security, verify that:

   * The data source name is **NSS**
   * The Cloud App Security API token used by Zscaler is active: Go to **Settings** > **Security extensions** > **API tokens**.

1. In Zscaler, verify that all statuses are valid: Go to **Administration** > **Partner Integrations** > **Microsoft Cloud App Security**.

1. If no apps are blocked, do the following:

     1. In Cloud App Security, in the Cloud App Catalog, verify that at least one app is marked as **Unsanctioned**
     1. In the Zscaler portal, go to **Administration** > **Access Control** > **URL categories**
     1. Under **User-Defined**, verify that **MCAS Unsanctioned Apps** exists and that custom URLs are defined

1. If the governance log contains no discovered data or completed parsed tasks, in Zscaler, verify that the NSS server allows the following [domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/network-requirements#log-collector)

   **NOTE**: By default, Zscaler integration supports connecting one NSS server to Cloud App Security. To connect additional NSS servers, open a ticket with Zscaler support.

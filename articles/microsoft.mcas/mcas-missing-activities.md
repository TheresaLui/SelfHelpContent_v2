# I can't see my activities in the activity log

Most users are able to resolve missing activities issues using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check if you are using a *scoped deployment* to filter out activities performed by members of certain user groups: [How to include or exclude user groups in Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/scoped-deployment#include-or-exclude-user-groups)
1. Make sure you enabled auditing in Office 365: [How to connect Office 365 to Cloud App security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/connect-office-365-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security#how-to-connect-office-365-to-cloud-app-security)
1. Check that the app connector is in a healthy state: In Cloud App Security, go to **Settings** > **App connectors**

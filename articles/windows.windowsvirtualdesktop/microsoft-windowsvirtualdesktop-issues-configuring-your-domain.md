# WVD - Issues configuring your domain

## Azure Windows Virtual Desktop: Issues configuring your domain

Most customers can resolve their issues using the following steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Make sure that the account used to domain-join the virtual machines (VMs) does not have multifactor authentication enabled
* Verify that the virtual network of the VMs has line-of-sight to the domain controller and that its DNS server points to the domain controller
* Review the [domain, user, and VM requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/overview#requirements) for Windows Virtual Desktop
* Review the [virtual machine details](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-azure-marketplace#virtual-machine-details) for the host pool creation
* Misconfiguration of session host might lead to status unavailable.[Review how to troubleshoot virtual machine configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/troubleshoot-vm-configuration-2019)

## **Recommended Documents**

* If you are using Azure AD Domain Services, begin with these [general troubleshooting steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/troubleshoot)
* If your domain is on a separate virtual network than the virtual network you have access to, you may need to work with your network administrators to configure [virtual network peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview)
* Verify and troubleshoot [ExpressRoute connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-expressroute-overview)

# Check if gateway is listening on port 443

Easiest test is to perform a TCP ping on port 443, for example using PSPing.

1. Go to ASC > Resource Explorer and select the VPN gateway
2. Copy the Public IP address of the gateway labelled as **Gateway VIP**
3. Open a command prompt window and run the following command **psping <Gateway VIP>:443**

Example:

~~~
C:\Users\administrator>psping 40.115.164.54:443

TCP connect to 40.115.164.54:443:
5 iterations (warmup 1) connecting test:
Connecting to 40.115.164.54:443 (warmup): 224.58ms
Connecting to 40.115.164.54:443: 221.00ms
Connecting to 40.115.164.54:443: 218.83ms
Connecting to 40.115.164.54:443: 219.18ms
Connecting to 40.115.164.54:443: 221.24ms

TCP connect statistics for 40.115.164.54:443:
Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Minimum = 218.83ms, Maximum = 221.24ms, Average = 220.06ms

**Important: the gateway might be correctly listening on port 8081 as per previous steps (meaning the gateway is healthy) but it might fail to respond on port 443.**

If OpenVPN is enabled and Gateway is not responding, we are facing an issue on the Gateway.

Is the gateway listening on port 443?
- Yes
- No

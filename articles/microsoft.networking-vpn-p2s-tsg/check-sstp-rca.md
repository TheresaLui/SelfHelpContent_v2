# Check if the customer was using SSTP protocol at the time of the issue

## Recommended Steps

1. Go to ASC > Resource Explorer and select the VPN gateway
2. Check the **VPN Tunneling Protocols** property
3. If the customer has more than one protocols enabled (for example SSTP + IKEv2) the only way to tell whether the failing client was using SSTP or IKEv2 is to ask the customer.

**Note**: the customer might have changed the setting since the time of the issue. It is advised to doublecheck with customer.

Was the client using SSTP to connect to the Point to Site VPN (this includes WebApps)

- No

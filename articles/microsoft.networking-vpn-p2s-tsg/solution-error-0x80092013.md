# Solution for VPN Point-to-Site client error 0x80092013

The error *"Error 0x80092013: The revocation function was unable to check revocation because the revocation server was offline"* is caused by an incorrect Proxy set up within your environment or is an on-premises network issue. The certificate revocation check function requires access to http://crl3.digicert.com/ssca-sha2-g1.crl and http://crl4.digicert.com/ssca-sha2-g1.crl.


## Recommended Steps

1. Have your local network administrator ensure the follow URLS are allowed your network proxies and edge firewalls: http://crl3.digicert.com/ssca-sha2-g1.crl and http://crl4.digicert.com/ssca-sha2-g1.crl.

# Check for Windows limitations and hotfixes for IKEv2

OS versions prior to Windows 10 are not supported and can only use SSTP or OpenVPN. Windows 10 requires a hotfix to be applied and a registry key to be added to correctly support IKEv2

## Recommended Steps

1. Review [IKE and SSTP KB for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about#does-azure-support-ikev2-vpn-with-windows) for information about hotfix and registry setting requirements
2. Validate the customer point-to-site client is running supported versions

Is the customer running a supported version of Windows with all hotfixes and registry settings required?
- Yes
- No

# Checking the VPN client being used

There might be multiple clients, so the customer needs to tell us which one he is using during the test.

## Recommended Steps

1. Check the SR verbatim or with the customer directly to see which type of client the customer is using during testing

Which client is the customer using?
- Azure VPN Client
- OpenVPN client

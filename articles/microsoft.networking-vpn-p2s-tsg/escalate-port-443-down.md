# Gateway not listening on port 443

If SSTP is enabled and Gateway is not responding, we are facing an issue on the Gateway in the RRAS component:

* The RRAS feature might have failed installation (known issue [6118450](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/edit/6118450))
* The RemoteAccess service might have failed to start (known issue [6606537](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/edit/6606537))

If you are facing any of the known RRAS issues, or some other similar variant, please reach out to a TA for further review.
It is advised for the TA to RDP into the gateway and inspect the RRAS status.

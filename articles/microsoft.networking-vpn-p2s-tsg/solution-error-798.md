# Solution for VPN Point-to-Site client error 798

The error *"Error 798: A certificate could not be found that can be used with this Extensible Authentication Protocol"* is the most common Azure Point to Site client error. It means that some required certificate is missing from the certificate store.

## Recommended Steps

1. Verify that the client certificate is in the user’s 'personal' certificate store by opening the certificate manager console (Start>Run>certmgr.msc>Personal>Certificates).
2. Ensure it has been imported with the private key as shown in the recommended document below
3. Verify that the certificate has a Subject Name specified
4. Check if the Certificate has expired by opening the certificate and checking the 'Valid From' field
5. Create and deploy a new certificate as outlined below if the steps above do not solve as the certificate may be corrupted

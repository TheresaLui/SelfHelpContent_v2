# Check P2S and Client DNS Settings

Verify if the customer can correctly resolve Azure resources via DNS.

## Recommended Steps

1. Run **ipconfig /all** on the client to check if P2S client does not have custom DNS showing on the VPN interface. If it does not, redownload the P2S client package and re-install.
1. Have the customer check if the point-to-site client is a member of the same Active Directory domain where the destination VM is, by reviewing the output of **sysdm.cpl**. If not, the resolution is to add a host entry of the Azure VM to the local host file on the point-to-site client, or leverage FQDNs.
1. Check the VPN Point to Site adapter metric to see if it is equal/higher than the metric of the Ethernet/Wifi adapter by having the customer run this PowerShell command on the client:
 ~~~powershell
 Get-NetIPInterface
 ~~~
4. Make sure the point to site client can correctly resolve Azure resources by pinging the FQDN of an Azure Virtual Machine.

Are the client DNS settings configured and working properly?
- Yes

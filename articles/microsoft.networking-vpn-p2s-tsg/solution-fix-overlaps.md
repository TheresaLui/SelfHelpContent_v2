The address space cannot overlap between Azure and customer premises

## Recommended Steps

1. Have the customer verify that the point to site client range is NOT overlapping with any of the customerâ€™s on-premises networks (There is no means to verify this on the Azure side)
2. The customer needs to choose a valid non-overlapping Point to Site IP range according to their environment

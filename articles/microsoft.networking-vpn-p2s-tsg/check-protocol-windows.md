# Checking the VPN protocol

There might be multiple VPN protocols methods enabled so the customer needs to tell us which one his client is using during the test.

## Recommended Steps

1. Check the SR verbatim or ask the customer to confirm which protocol their clients are using


Which protocol is the customer using?
- SSTP
- IKEv2
- OpenVPN

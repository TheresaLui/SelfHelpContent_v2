# Check RCA for IKEv2 or OpenVpn clients on P2SLogsTable

IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols are handled by an Azure Specific driver on the Gateway, which has always on logging to Jarvis/Kusto enabled by default.

Such logging is available at the [P2SlogsTable](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/81FCCD6B)

In case of IKEv2 you can also leverage the [IkeLogsTable](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/A5B239BD).

## Recommended Steps

1. Review the diagnostics at the time of the issue and try to identify an error code from the logs
2. Consult a TA if you are unable to find a specific error code from the logs.

Are you able to identify a specific error code from the logs?
- Yes, I have an error code
- No, the log is not helpful

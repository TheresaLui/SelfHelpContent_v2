# Check for IP Address Overlaps

1. Identify Point to site Range
   1. Go to ASC > Resource Explorer and select the VPN gateway
   2. Check the **VPN Client Address Pool** property. This is the point to site range
2. Identify Virtual Network Address Space
   1. Go to ASC > Resource Explorer and select the VPN gateway
   2. Find the **Virtual Network Name** where the gateway is and click on the Hyperlink to open the Vnet
   3. Identify the Virtual Network Address space
3. Identify On-premises ranges - the customer must provide this information, as it's not saved in Azure.

Does the point to site range or the virtual network address space overlap with the onpremises network address range?
- Yes
- No

# Solution for VPN Point-to-Site client error 13834

The error *"Connection was prevented because of error 13834 = Error processing ID payload"* is an error raised by the IPsec stack on Windows OS client when parsing the Traffic Selector payload. The Windows OS client supports a maximum of 25 Traffic Selectors. Any amount of TS higher than 25 will cause the failure with error 13834. For the point to site connections, a Traffic Selector is added for each subnet in each local network connected to the VPN gateway via site to site. 

## Recommended Steps

1. Modify the on-premises IP address prefixes by combining multiple on-premises subnets using CIDR until the total is less than 25

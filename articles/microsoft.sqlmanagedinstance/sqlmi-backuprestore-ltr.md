# Long-term backup retention

In Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can configure a long-term backup retention policy (LTR) as a public preview feature. This lets you automatically retain database backups in separate Azure Blob storage containers for up to 10 years. You can then recover a database using these backups with PowerShell.

**LTR for managed instances is currently available in public preview in Azure Public regions.**

## **Recommended Steps**

You can [configure the long-term retention policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/long-term-backup-retention-configure) from Azure portal or PowerShell. 

### Azure RBAC roles to manage long-term retention
For `Get-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLongTermRetentionBackup` and `Restore-AzSqlInstanceDatabase`, you'll need to have one of the following roles:

- Subscription Owner role
- Managed Instance Contributor role
- Custom role with the following permissions:
  - Microsoft.Sql/locations/longTermRetentionManagedInstanceBackups/read
  - Microsoft.Sql/locations/longTermRetentionManagedInstances/longTermRetentionManagedInstanceBackups/read
  - Microsoft.Sql/locations/longTermRetentionManagedInstances/longTermRetentionDatabases/longTermRetentionManagedInstanceBackups/read

For `Remove-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLongTermRetentionBackup`, you'll need to have one of the following roles:

- Subscription Owner role
- Custom role with the following permission:
  - Microsoft.Sql/locations/longTermRetentionManagedInstances/longTermRetentionDatabases/longTermRetentionManagedInstanceBackups/delete
  Note

**The Managed Instance Contributor role does not have permission to delete LTR backups.**

Azure RBAC permissions can be granted in either subscription or resource group scope. However, to access LTR backups that belong to a dropped instance, the permission must be granted in the subscription scope of that instance.

# Increase in resource consumption

To understand increase in resource consumption consider troubleshooting with monitoring tools that will help you identify the issue..

## **Recommended steps**

To tune performance of database workloads, see [Monitoring and performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview)

To help identify resource consumption, consider using the following options:

* Use Managed Instance overview through Azure portal for simple overview of CPU, IOPS and storage utilization
* For more advanced monitoring helping identify individual performance of queries, consider [Azure SQL Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/azure-sql)
* Consider using own DMV queries
* Consider using 3rd party solutions available for managed instance

## **Recommended Steps**

- If you are getting the error while using some feature, check if the feature supported in [Managed Instance]()
- If the feature is supported, check for any [unavailable options or known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information)
- If you are not sure how to use a feature, look for examples in [Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-index#5-minute-quickstarts), [Azure CLI samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cli-samples#managed-instance), [Azure PowerShell samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-powershell-samples#managed-instance), or [How-to articles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-howto)
- If you are using the feature that is available and you are getting an error, proceed with creating the ticket and add the error code, message, and as many details as possible
- If the feature or option is not supported, vote for [existing feature requests, or file a new one](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/915676-sql-managed-instance) in the Azure Feedback forum

# Readable replica

The Read Scale-Out feature in Business Critical service tier of Azure SQL Managed Instance allows you to load-balance read-only workloads using the capacity of one of the read-only replicas instead of sharing the read-write replica. This way the read-only workload will be isolated from the main read-write workload and will not affect its performance.

## **Recommended Steps**

- Make sure that your SQL connection string is configured with ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly if you want to connect to readable replica
- Verify that you are connected to readable replica by executing command SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), 'Updateability')
- When connected to a read-only replica, you can access the performance metrics using the sys.dm_db_resource_stats DMV.
- To access query plan statistics, use the sys.dm_exec_query_stats, sys.dm_exec_query_plan, and sys.dm_exec_sql_text DMVs.

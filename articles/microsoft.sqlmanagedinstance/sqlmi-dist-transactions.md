# Resolve Distributed Transactions issues with Managed Instance

Distributed transactions can be executed across different Azure SQL Managed Instances by using distributed transactions. This feature is currently in **preview mode**. Most users can resolve issues by following the information below.

## **Recommended Steps**

- In case of the error message, "MSDTC not available," go through the connectivity and security steps below
- In scenarios with multiple instances, check the connectivity between the instances
  - If distributed transaction with linked server is failing, try to execute a simple select query on the linked server. This query can indicate if the problem is with the linked server setup rather than distributed transactions. Basic requirement for linked servers: Ports 1433, 11000 - 12000 are allowed.
  - If instances are part of the same subnet, there are no additional requirements on the subnet level, and instances are expected to use custom port from range 11000-12000
  - If instances are not part the same subnet, port 5024 needs to be open on all subnets for all participating instances. Also, port range 11000-12000 needs to be open on all subnets for all participating instances.
  - If instances are on different VNets, check if VNet peering is properly set up
- Check if security requirements are satisfied
  - Verify that instances are added to the [Server Trust Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/server-trust-group-overview)
- To resolve stuck, deadlocked, orphaned, or in-doubt distributed transactions, use the kill unit of work (or session id). For more details, see [KILL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15).

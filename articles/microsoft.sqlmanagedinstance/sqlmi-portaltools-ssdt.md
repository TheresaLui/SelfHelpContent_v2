# SQL Server Data Tools

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is a modern development tool for building Azure SQL Managed Instance relational databases. SSDT is supported for Managed Instance since Visual Studio 2019 with some limitations as follows:

* Using Azure AD server principals (logins) and users with SQL Server Data Tools currently isn't supported with SSDT.
* Scripting for Azure AD server principals (logins) and users isn't supported in SSDT.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure you are running Visual Studio 2019, or higher.
* Ensure you are using the latest version of SQL Server Data Tools, as older version than 2019 will not work with Managed Instance. [Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/ssdt/).
* Ensure you are not using Azure AD logins with SSDT as this is not supported at this time.

## **Recommended Documents**

* To learn more about SSDT, see [SQL Server Data Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssdt/sql-server-data-tools)

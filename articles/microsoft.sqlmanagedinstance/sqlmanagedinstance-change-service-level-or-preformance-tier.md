# Service level or performance tier change

## **Recommended Steps**

* Applications hosted on Managed Instance can leverage Azure platform elasticity through the online update service tier operation, which allows independent scaling of compute and storage ranging from 8 to 80 vCores and from 32GB to 8TB respectively. Also, changing the service tier from General Purpose to Business Critical and vice versa, without application downtime, according to the workloadâ€™s requirements.<br> 
* You can view status of operation in your activity log. Resizing related to Business Critical service tear may require size-of-data operations and take more time.<br>

# Managed Instance - Not enough IP addresses for creation

## We ran diagnostics on your resource and found an issue

<!--issueDescription-->
You tried to create Managed Instance on subscription <!--$SubscriptionId-->SubscriptionId<!--/$SubscriptionId--> and resource group <!--$ResourceGroup-->ResourceGroup<!--/$ResourceGroup--> in subnet that doesn't have enough available IP addresses, so create operation could not be performed.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Careful planning of subnet size for your managed instance deployments is recommended. You can't resize the subnet after you deploy the resources inside. For more details visit: [Determine required subnet size & range for Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/vnet-subnet-determine-size).

* If you are trying to create a managed instance in the subnet with existing instances, create new subnet with more IP addresses allocated and deploy managed instance in the new subnet
* If you are trying to create a managed instance in an empty subnet, remove that subnet and create new one with enough IP addresses allocated. By design, a managed instance needs a minimum of 32 IP addresses in a subnet. As a result, you can use minimum subnet mask of /27 when defining your subnet IP ranges.

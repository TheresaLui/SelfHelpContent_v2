# Failed logins due to user initiated manual failover

## **Failed logins due to user initiated manual failover**
<!--issueDescription-->
We ran diagnostics for managed instance **<!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->** and time period between **<!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime-->** UTC and **<!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->** UTC and we found failed login(s) caused by instance reconfiguration(s) due to **user initiated manual failover(s)**.

High availability is a fundamental part of the SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance platform that works transparently for your database application. However, we recognize that you may want to test how the automatic failover operations initiated during planned or unplanned events would impact an application before you deploy it to production. You can manually trigger a failover by calling a special API to restart a managed instance. The failed logins listed above are result of user initiated manual failover(s). Most reconfiguration events take less than 60 seconds to complete. We are working continually on minimizing incidence of updates and their impact to instance availability. 

## **Recommended Steps** 

Building resiliency into your application to account for these situations can help provide seamless experience for the end users. For information about connectivity in Azure SQL, how to implement retry logic, and to understand common errors in Azure SQL please refer to the [database connection errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-develop-error-messages#database-connection-errors-transient-errors-and-other-temporary-errors) article.

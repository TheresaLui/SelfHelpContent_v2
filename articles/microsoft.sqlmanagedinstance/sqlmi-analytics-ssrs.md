# SQL Server Reporting Services

SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is a stateless service that uses a database engine to store metadata and object definitions in two databases. Azure SQL Managed Instance cannot run SSRS as a service. However, it can host an SSRS catalog database for a reporting server installed on Azure Virtual machine, using SQL Server authentication. 

## **Recommended Steps**
- [Hosting SSRS databases in Azure SQL Managed Instance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql/hosting-ssrs-databases-in-azure-sql-managed-instance/ba-p/1700197)
- [Migrate SSRS paginated reports to PowerBI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/paginated-reports-report-builder-power-bi)

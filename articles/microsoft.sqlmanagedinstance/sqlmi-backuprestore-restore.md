# Restore a managed instance database from Blob Storage

Microsoft Azure SQL Managed Instance generates [automatic backups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups) (full backups every week, differential every 12 hours, and log backups every 5-10 min) that you can use to [restore a database to a specific point-in-time in the past](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-recovery-using-backups#point-in-time-restore) within the retention period or use to [restore accidentally deleted databases](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-SQL-Database/Restore-dropped-database-on-Azure-SQL-Managed-Instance/ba-p/386285). Backups are kept 7 days by default and [this period can be increased up to 35 days (10 year long-term retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups#how-to-change-the-pitr-backup-retention-period) is not supported at this time). If you are experiencing some issues with automated backups or point-in-time restore operations, the following troubleshooting steps below might help you to identify the issue.

## **Recommended Steps**

**Restore a Database to a Specific Point-in-Time**

- Find the database in the Azure portal and check the earliest restore time value. Verify that the point-in time that you specified for the restore is after this earliest restore time value.

**Connect to a Restored Database**

- Please wait a little longer to attempt a connection to the database. The restored database must be registered in Azure, in the Business Critical tier, and it should have completed its replication/seeding to all the secondary replicas. Multiple factors can affect how quickly all these steps are completed.

**Perform a Point-in-Time Restore of a Database**

- Make sure that the account that is performing the point-in-time restore has Write permission on the SQL Managed Instance and Read permission on the Azure subscription and resource group. The recommended role is [SQL Managed Instance Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#sql-managed-instance-contributor).

For additional information, please see the links listed in the Recommended Documents section.

## Automatic Backups 

**Calculate Storage Backup Costs**

- See the [Storage Costs section of the Automated backups â€“ Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-overview?tabs=single-database#storage-costs) article and go to the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)

**Monitor the Performance of Automatic Backup Requests**

- [Create an XEvent session](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-and-restore-of-sql-server-databases#monitor-progress-with-xevent) that traces sqlserver.backup_restore_progress_trace events

**Monitor the Status of Automatic Backups**

- Review the error logs or use the [Azure Data Studio Managed Instance extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/azure-sql-managed-instance-extension#logs)

**Monitor the Progress of the Automatic Backup Restore**

- Use [T-SQL to query Dynamic Management views](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/restore-statements-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-mi-current#restore-mi-database-progress)

**Unable to Connect to a Restored Database**

- Please wait a little longer to attempt a connection to the database. The restored database must be registered in Azure, in the Business Critical tier, and it needs to complete its replication/seeding to all the secondary replicas. Multiple factors can affect how quickly all these steps are completed.

# How to questions related to performance issues in Azure SQL Database

## **Recommended Documents**

* Poor performance in Azure SQL DB is most often either related to excessive CPU utilization or a query waiting on a resource. To resolve either of these issues, review [Monitoring and performance tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview?WT.mc_id=pid:13491:sid:32630450/).

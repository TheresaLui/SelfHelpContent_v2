# Delete Virtual Cluster

Managed instance at a high level is a set of service components hosted on a dedicated set of isolated virtual machines that run inside the customerâ€™s virtual network subnet forming a [virtual cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-connectivity-architecture#high-level-connectivity-architecture).

## **Recommended Steps**

Each virtual cluster can contain multiple managed instance in the same subnet. Upon deletion of the last managed instance in the same subnet, the virtual cluster that has contained these instances is kept for customers free of charge for the next 12 hours. This behavior is provided by design to enable faster creation of managed instance in the same subnet. During this period, the subnet associated with the virtual cluster can't be deleted.
 
Immediate release of the subnet used by an empty virtual cluster is now possible through option to manually delete the virtual cluster using [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-delete-virtual-cluster) and [API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/sql/virtualclusters/delete). This allows for immediate release of subnet used by managed instances hosted in the virtual cluster.

# Setup Vulnerability Assessment for Managed Instance

SQL Vulnerability Assessment is a service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Use it to proactively improve your database security. Vulnerability Assessment is supported for Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## **Recommended Steps**

To setup Vulnerability Assessment perform these steps in [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment#implementing-vulnerability-assessment):

1. Run a scan
2. View the report
3. Analyze the results and resolve issues

To customize your experience:

* Set your baseline (the baseline is essentially a customization of how the results are reported)
* Run a new scan to see your customized tracking report

To automate vulnerability assessment:

* Set up periodic recurring scans

Track and view reports:

* Export an assessment report
* View scan history

Alternative ways to configure the service:

* To setup vulnerability assessments using Azure PowerShell, see [Manage Vulnerability Assessments using Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment#manage-vulnerability-assessments-using-azure-powershell)
* To setup using REST API, see [Managed Instance Vulnerability Assessments - Create or Update methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/sql/managedinstancevulnerabilityassessments/createorupdate)

## **Recommended Documents**

* For more information, see [SQL Vulnerability Assessment service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment).

# Resolve Server Trust Group issues with Managed Instance

Server trust groups are used to easily manage trust between the set of Azure SQL Managed Instances. This feature is in **preview mode** and currently Server Trust Group can contain only two instances.

## **Recommended Steps**

If you are experiencing some issues with Server Trust Groups, the following steps can help you find a way to troubleshoot the issues.

- It is required that Azure SQL Managed Instances are under the same Azure subscription.
- If instances are on different VNets it is required that ports 5024, 11000 - 12000 are allowed.

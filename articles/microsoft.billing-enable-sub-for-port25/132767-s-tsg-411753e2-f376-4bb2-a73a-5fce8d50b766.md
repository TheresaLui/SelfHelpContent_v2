# Solution Subscription is not qualified
<!--issueDescription-->
This subscription is unauthorized to send mail over TCP port 25. We have found your subscription, without exception, **cannot be authorized** to send mail from Azure resources on TCP port 25.<br><br>Azure is committed to stopping SPAM and reducing the customer impact caused by negative IP reputation. Sending outbound email directly to external domains (such as outlook.com, gmail.com) from a virtual machine (VM) is available only for certain subscription types. Outbound SMTP connections using TCP port 25 (primarily used for unauthenticated email delivery) are blocked for most new subscriptions.

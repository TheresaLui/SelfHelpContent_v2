# Can't connect PostgreSQL database server because of running out connections

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your connection issues to your PostgreSQL server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that <!--$Count-->Count<!--/$Count--> connection attempts to fail due to connections to your database server have been running out between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended steps**

* Try to reduce the number of concurrent connections by closing idle connections. We recommend using a connection pooler like PgBouncer to manage connections
* Ensure you have chosen a compute tier that can support the maximum number of connections required by the application

# Server is facing slow login issues

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your performance issues with your PostgreSQL server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that 70% of login setup time is above 1 second between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->. Slow login issues can have many different root causes.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you are maxing out IO, memory or compute resources, scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, use accelerated networking for lowest connection latency. Please see the recommended documents section. 
* In order to avoid overhead for establishing new connections, consider using a [connection pooler between your application and Postgres server](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-for-PostgreSQL/Not-all-Postgres-connection-pooling-is-equal/ba-p/825717). A pooler like [pgBouncer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-for-PostgreSQL/Steps-to-install-and-setup-PgBouncer-connection-pooling-proxy/ba-p/730555) would help optimize connection management.
* If you are connecting from the Azure Kubernetes Service, review the [Develop with Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-aks) documentation

# **All connections to PostgreSQL Flexible Server are failing suddenly**
## **Recommended Steps**

The cause may be an issue in Azure infra-structure or ongoing/scheduled maintenance activities.

- There may be a planned maintenance activity going on your database server. Check the **Resource Health** for the status. We recommend setting up [custom maintenance window](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-maintenance-portal) that aligns with your workload pattern.
- Check the **Resource health** for your server to see if there were any reported events that could have caused the connection disruption
- Check the **Activity log** for your server to see if there are changes to the server that could have causes the connection drops
- Check your client logs if you are experiencing connection timeouts or query timeouts. If yes, please review your client's timeout settings.

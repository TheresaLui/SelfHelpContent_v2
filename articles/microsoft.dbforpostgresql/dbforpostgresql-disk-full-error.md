# PostgreSQL server marked read-only because server storage is full

<!--issueDescription-->
During our investigation we determined that the database server was marked as read-only. When a server is marked as read-only, all new transactions that try to write to the server (Insert/Update/Delete) are expected to fail. Read queries will continue to work uninterrupted.
<!--/issueDescription-->

Servers with less than 100 GB provisioned storage are marked read-only if the free storage is less than 512MB or 5% of the provisioned storage size. Servers with more than 100 GB provisioned storage are marked read only when the free storage is less than 5 GB. For example:

1. If you have provisioned 110 GB of storage, and the actual utilization goes over 105 GB, the server is marked read-only.
2. Alternatively, if you have provisioned 5 GB of storage, the server is marked read-only when the free storage reaches less than 512 MB.

The server will automatically be set to read/write again, when at least 5 GB of storage or 5% of the provisioned storage is free again.

## **Recommended steps**

1. To fix this issue, please increase the storage size using the portal as described in [reaching storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-pricing-tiers).
2. You can increase the storage in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) by clicking on the "Pricing Tier" and then scale up the storage as per your requirement.

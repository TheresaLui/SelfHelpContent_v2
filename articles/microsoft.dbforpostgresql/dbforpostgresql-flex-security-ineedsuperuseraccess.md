# Managing permissions on in Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers

Each Azure Database for PostgreSQL server is created with a highly privileged admin role. User permissions for other users you create are managed through the PostgreSQL built-in user management capabilities. 

Please note that superuser access cannot be granted to you in the managed service.

## **Recommended Steps**


* If you lose your admin account password, you can reset the password on your server's portal page

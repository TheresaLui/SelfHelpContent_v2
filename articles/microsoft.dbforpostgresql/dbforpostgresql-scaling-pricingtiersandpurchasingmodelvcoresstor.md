# Pricing tiers and purchasing model in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized tiers:

* **Basic** tier is designed for workloads requiring light compute and I/O performance
* **General Purpose** tier is for most business workloads requiring balanced compute and memory with scalable I/O throughput
* **Memory Optimized** tier is for high performance database workloads requiring in-memory performance for faster transaction processing and higher concurrency

* Are you trying to switch from Basic to General Purpose/Memory Optimized service tiers, or vice-versa?
    * This action not supported in the product, but you can do it yourself. Follow the steps in [Upgrade from Basic to General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-for-PostgreSQL/Upgrade-from-Basic-to-General-Purpose-or-Memory-Optimized-tiers/ba-p/690976) blog.

* Are you looking for ways to save money with a 1-year or 3-year commitment?
    * Consider prepaying for Azure Database for PostgreSQL compute resources to get lower compute prices, as compared to no-commitment, pay-as-you-go arrangements. With Azure Database for PostgreSQL reserved capacity, you can make an upfront commitment on PostgreSQL server for a one-year or three-year period in order to receive a significant discount on the compute costs.

# Pricing tiers and purchasing model in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized tiers:

* **Basic** tier is designed for workloads requiring light compute and I/O performance
* **General Purpose** tier is for most business workloads requiring balanced compute and memory with scalable I/O throughput
* **Memory Optimized** tier is for high performance database workloads requiring in-memory performance for faster transaction processing and higher concurrency

Please note that changing to and from the Basic pricing tier after server creation is not supported.

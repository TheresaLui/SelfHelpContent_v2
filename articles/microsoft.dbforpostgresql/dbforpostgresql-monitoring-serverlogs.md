# Monitoring server logs

Azure Database for PostgreSQL has error, query, and audit logs available. Query and error logs can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and sub-optimal performance. Visit Security >> Auditing for troubleshooting guidance on audit logs.

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Review how to [configure server logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-server-logs)
* Familiarise yourself with the [log parameters](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-postgresql/how-to-configure-postgres-log-settings/ba-p/1214716)
* Verbose logging will cause a significant performance overhead. We recommend you only use statement logging parameters like log_statement and log_min_duration_statement for short periods of troubleshooting. 
* Access to transaction logs is not available

There are two main ways logs can be consumed: .log files or Azure diagnostic logging (which routes to storage account, Event Hub, or Azure Monitor logs).

*.log files*
* .log files provide short-term storage for logs in a CSV-like format. This is the default log option on Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
* The .log files rotate every 1 hour or 100MB size, whichever comes first
* Retention:
  * There is a maximum of 1GB of storage available per server for the .log files. Oldest logs will be deleted to make room for new ones.
  * You can set the retention period for this log storage using the **log_retention_period** parameter. The default value is 3 days; the maximum value is 7 days.
  * You can download logs to store them for longer in your preferred location
  * The URL generated for accessing your .log file is authenticated using your logged in user's credentials. The URL includes a token that was generated from your authentication. Unauthenticated users cannot view the log unless you choose to share the URL.
  
*Azure Monitor diagnostic logging*

Alternatively, you can use Azure Monitor Diagnostic settings to send logs in JSON format to a storage account, Event Hub, or Azure Monitor logs for longer term storage and analysis.
* Learn how to configure this feature in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL [logs document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-server-logs)
  * This feature is only available in the General Purpose and Memory Optimized pricing tiers

# Managing networking

Firewall rules or virtual networking need to be configured to enable access to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

## **Recommended Steps**

* You can either specify a single IP address or a range of IP addresses that are allowed to access your server. Server-level firewall rules can be managed through the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, and our REST API.
* If you are using a virtual network (vnet), ensure that the service endpoints are correctly configured for the Postgres server and the client. This can be done using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
* If you are trying to connect to your server from an Azure PaaS service that doesn't have a static IP and doesn't support virtual networks, you can turn on *Allow access to Azure IP addresses*. Turning this on opens the firewall to all IP addresses in Azure.

# High percentage of short-lived connections

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your performance issues with your PostgreSQL server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that 80% of connections are being closed under 1 second between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->. Opening new connections is an expensive operation. The high frequency of connection open/close is likely consuming server resources and making queries slower.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Consider using a connection pooler like pgBouncer between your application and Postgres server to optimize connection management. A connection pooler will reuse connections instead of opening new ones.

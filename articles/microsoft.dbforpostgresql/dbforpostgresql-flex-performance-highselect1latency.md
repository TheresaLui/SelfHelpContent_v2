# Troubleshooting high latency with `Select 1`

The time taken to execute a `SELECT 1` query is a common way to measure the network latency between the client and the PostgreSQL database. Most customers can optimize the latency by working through the following recommended steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure that your client and PostgreSQL Database are in the same Azure region
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, turn on accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* Ensure you are measuring latency on an existing connection. Creating a new connection can take 100+ milliseconds. We strongly recommend connection pooling to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections.
* Reduce the number of round trips between your application and the database if possible
* We strongly recommend that you use a database connection pool or a long connection to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

# Cluster sizing for Hyperscale (Citus)

## **Recommended Steps**
* **Multi-tenant SaaS use-case**: For those migrating to Citus from an existing single-node database instance, we recommend choosing a cluster where the number of worker cores and RAM in total equals that of the original instance. In such scenarios we have seen performance improvements because sharding improves resource utilization, allowing smaller indices etc.

* **Real-time analytics use-case**: 
   * Total cores: when working data fits in RAM, you can expect a linear performance improvement on Citus proportional to the number of worker cores. To determine the right number of cores for your needs, consider the current latency for queries in your single-node database and the required latency in Citus. Divide current latency by desired latency, and round the result.

   * Worker RAM: the best case would be providing enough memory that the majority of the working set fits in memory. You can run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on a query to determine how much memory it requires.

* A cluster [can be scaled from its initial configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/howto-hyperscale-scaling)

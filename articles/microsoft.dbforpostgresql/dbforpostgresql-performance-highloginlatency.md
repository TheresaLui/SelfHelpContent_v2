# Troubleshooting login performance

Slow login issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps to solve for the most common issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you are maxing out IO, memory or compute resources, scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, use accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* Use connection pooling on the client whenever possible to avoid overhead for establishing new connections
* If you are connecting from the Azure Kubernetes Service, review the [Develop with Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-aks) documentation

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Accelerated networking for Linux VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli)<br>
* [Accelerated networking for Windows VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell)

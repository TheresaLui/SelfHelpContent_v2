# Using Azure REST APIs and ARM templates for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL management operations can be performed using REST APIs.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you want to know whether a specific command is supported, samples on how to use a command, or which parameters are required, please refer to our [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/postgresql/)
* If you are using Azure Resource Manager templates and have an issue:
    * To familiarize yourself with Azure Resource Manager templates, create a sample template by clicking on **Export Template** in the portal for an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL
    * Confirm that required parameters are set and valid. See the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/postgresql/) to understand the valid values of the parameters.

* Poll the status of the operation after you issues the request. Most operations are asynchronous and can take a few minutes to complete.
* Attempting to delete a component by removing its mention from the ARM template ('complete mode deletion') is not supported. See [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/complete-mode-deletion) for more information.
* To move a server across resource groups or subscriptions, review [Azure resource move](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources)

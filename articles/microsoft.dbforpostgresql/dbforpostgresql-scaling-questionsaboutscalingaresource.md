# Scaling Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Are you trying to switch from Basic to General Purpose/Memory Optimized service tiers or vice-versa?

    * If you want to switch from Basic to General Purpose or Memory Optimized and vice-versa, please follow the steps in [Upgrade from Basic to General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-for-PostgreSQL/Upgrade-from-Basic-to-General-Purpose-or-Memory-Optimized-tiers/ba-p/690976) blog.

* Are you experiencing dropped connections and no new connections can be established while compute (vCores) scaling operation is in progress?

    * vCore scaling requires a server restart. The window when new connections cannot be established varies, but in most cases, is less than a minute. We recommend you implement retry logic so your application can seamlessly reconnect to the Postgres server once the scale operation is completed. Storage scaling does not cause a restart.

* Did you find out that your server is set to read only? Are you getting an error saying that your storage is almost full? 
    * To avoid situation when Postgres becomes unresponsive, your server will be set to read-only when storage is almost full. When it happens you can either increase size of provisioned storage or start a new read-write session and drop some data to free storage. Please refer to [this documentation page for thresholds when server is set to read-only and steps to unlock writes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-pricing-tiers#reaching-the-storage-limit).

* Would you like to scale up the primary server with a replica and it doesn't work? Are you trying to scale down a replica?

    * Before a master server configuration is updated to new values, update the replica configuration to equal or greater values. This action ensures the replica can keep up with any changes made to the master.

* Are you attempting to scale storage beyond 4 TB and can't do it?
 
    * Your server may be running on a legacy storage option supporting up to 4 TB only. To upgrade your server to support up to 16 TB, perform a dump & restore to a new server created with desired storage size including sizes between 4 and 16 TB.

* Are you trying to use the Azure Monitor auto-scale feature with Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single server? 
    * Azure Monitor auto-scale feature is not supported for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single server. However, you can configure auto-scaling using Azure run books. Please refer to [How to auto-scale an Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL instance with Azure run books and Python](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Database-Support-Blog/How-to-auto-scale-an-Azure-Database-for-MySQL-PostgreSQL/ba-p/369177).

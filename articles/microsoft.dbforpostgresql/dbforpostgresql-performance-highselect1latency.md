# Troubleshooting high latency with 'Select 1'

The time taken to execute a 'SELECT 1' query is a common way to measure the network latency between the client and the PostgreSQL database. Most customers optimize the latency by working through the recommended steps.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure your client and PostgreSQL Database are in the same Azure region
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, turn on accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* If you are connecting from the Azure Kubernetes Service, review the [Develop with Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-aks) documentation
* Ensure you are measuring latency on an existing connection. Creating a new connection can take 100+ milliseconds. Connection pooling is strongly recommended to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections.
* Reduce the number of round trips between your application and the database if possible
* We strongly recommend that you use a database connection pool or a long connection to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

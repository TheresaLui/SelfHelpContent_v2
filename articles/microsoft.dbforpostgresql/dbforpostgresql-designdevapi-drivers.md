# Connecting to Azure Databases for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL uses the community edition of PostgreSQL. As such, most drivers and tools are able to connect to the service. There are, however, some limitations in functionality because Azure database for PostgreSQL is a fully managed platform as a service.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check the current known [limitations of the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-limits) to see if your scenario is not supported
* Review the list of officially [support drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/concepts-connection-libraries) to make sure you are using a supported driver version

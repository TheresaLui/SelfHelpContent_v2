# Enabling Full-text Query for Cassandra or Mongo accounts or for RuntimeQueryStatistics,

<!--issueDescription-->
### ** THIS IS NOT A CUSTOMER READY CONTENT MESSAGE **

**Investigation (not customer message):**
When a customer enables the CassandraRequests/MongoRequests diagnostic logs, the "piiCommandText" property is empty by default. To enable the full-text logging for the Cassandra/Mongo(i.e. Full text or plain text), this will be done by PG.

Please create a CRI to Cosmos DB Product Team for Monitoring team.

## Customer message:
Based on the troubleshooting step before, please write your conclusions to customer. Don't include any Kusto Query, you can share the output table but make sure to not incude any internal information.

# My subscription has been disabled

### **Reactivate a disabled Azure subscription**

**Reasons your Azure subscription could have been disabled**

* [Your credit is expired](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled#your-credit-is-expired)
* [You reached your spending limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled#you-reached-your-spending-limit)
* [Your bill is past due](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled#your-bill-is-past-due)
* [The bill exceeds your credit card limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled#the-bill-exceeds-your-credit-card-limit)
* [The subscription was accidentally cancelled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled#the-subscription-was-accidentally-canceled)

## **Recommended Steps**

**Reactivate a subscription in the Azure portal**

If you're the Account Administrator and have a pay-as-you-go subscription, you can reactivate it in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Go to **Subscriptions** and then select the canceled subscription.
3. Select **Reactivate**.
4. Confirm reactivation by selecting **OK**.

If your subscription isn't a subscription with Pay-As-You-Go rates, contact support within 90 days of cancellation to reactivate your subscription. For more information see, [Reactivate a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription#reactivate-a-subscription).

# Azure marketplace charges on my bill

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Why do I see Azure Marketplace charges on my bill?**

[Billing infrastructure costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#billing-infrastructure-costs) for **virtual machines** and **Azure applications**, Azure infrastructure usage fees are billed to the customer's Azure subscription. Infrastructure usage fees are priced and presented separately from the software provider's licensing fees on the customer's invoice.

To learn more about pricing, billing, invoicing and payout considerations for the Microsoft commercial marketplace, see [Transacting in the commerical marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations). This article includes details on the transact overview, pricing models and more.

### **View and download invoices for external services**

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), your third-party services are billed with the rest of your Azure services on a single invoice.

**You can view and download your Azure Marketplace invoices from the Azure portal by following these steps**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)</br>
2. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**</br>
3. In the left menu, select **Invoices**</br>
4. In the subscription drop-down, select the subscription associated with your Marketplace services</br>
5. Review the **Type** column in the list of invoices. If an invoice is for a Marketplace service, the type will be **Azure Marketplace and Reservations**</br>
6. To filter by type so that you are only looking at invoices for Azure Marketplace and Reservations, select the **Type** filter. Then select **Azure Marketplace and Reservations** in the drop-down.</br>
7. Select the download icon on the right for the invoice you want to download</br>
8. Under **Invoice**, select the blue **Download** button</br>

**Review Marketplace invoice**

Compare your Azure Marketplace total on Reports > Usage Summary in the Enterprise portal with your marketplace invoice. The marketplace invoice is only for Azure Marketplace purchases and usage. The amounts on the Usage Summary don't include tax.

1. Sign in to the [Enterprise portal](https://ea.azure.com/). Select **Reports**
2. On the top right-hand corner of the tab, switch the view from **M** to **C** and match the period on the invoice
3. The **Azure Marketplace** total should match the **Total Sale** on your marketplace invoice
4. Go to **Download Usage** to get more information about your usage-based charges. Under **Marketplace Charges**, select **Download Note**: This report doesn't include taxes or show one-time purchases.

# purchased a support plan and billed 

## **Recommended Steps**

### **Cancel a support plan**

If upon receiving your invoice you see a charge for support plan purchase that you feel you havenâ€™t purchased explicitly, you can proceed to cancel the support plan. The support plans are typically purchased when you upgrade your free trial account to a pay-as-you-go account.</br>

**Follow these steps to cancel a support plan**

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**</br>
2. Under **Billing**, select **Recurring charges**</br>
3. On the right-hand side for the support plan line item, select the ellipsis (...) and select **Turn off auto-renewal**</br>

For more information on how to cancel your support plan, see [Cancel a support plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription#cancel-a-support-plan).</br>

>Note: Support plans provide technical support for any Azure related question you encounter. If you cancel the support plan now, you can always choose to purchase it again through the Azure portal.

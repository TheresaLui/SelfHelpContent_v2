# Traffic Analytics - Malicious Data

## **Recommended Steps**

###  **How does Traffic Analytic show the malicious traffic in my environment**

* Traffic Analytics relies on Microsoft [internal threat intelligence systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics-faq#how-does-traffic-analytics-decide-that-an-ip-is-malicious) to deem an IP as malicious

### **I want to get more information about the malicious traffic in my environment**

* Please raise a support ticket with Azure Security Center to know more about the data

### **I want to block NSG from allowing malicious traffic in my environment**

* You can control allowed traffic by using [Network Security Group rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) <br>

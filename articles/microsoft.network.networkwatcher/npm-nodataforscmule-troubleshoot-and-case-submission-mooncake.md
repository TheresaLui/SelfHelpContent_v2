# No monitoring data in NPM for a specific rule

## **Recommended Steps**

*  To check if NPM is receiving any data for a specific test, run the below mentioned query in LogAnlaytics for your workspace:

```
NetworkMonitoring
| where TestName == "<<Your Service Connectivity Monitor test name>>"
| take 5
```

* It takes NPM about 30 mins to start showing data after initial setup

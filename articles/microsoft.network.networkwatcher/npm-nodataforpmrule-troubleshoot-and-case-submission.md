```
NetworkMonitoring
| where SubType == "Network"
| where SourceNetwork == "<<Your Network name>>"
```

*  To check if NPM is receiving any data for a given subnetwork, run the below mentioned query in Log Analytics for your workspace:

```
NetworkMonitoring
| where SubType == "SubNetwork"
| where SourceSubNetwork == "<<Your SubNetworkNetwork IP>>"
```

*  To check if NPM is receiving any data for a given rule, run the below mentioned query in Log Analytics for your workspace:

# Issues with accessing the fairness dashboard

## **Recommended Steps**
### Accessing the fairness dashboard from the UI
If a Run uploaded fairness statistics, then they will appear as a tab on the run's history. To access the run history from the Azure Machine Learning studio client, navigate to the "Experiment" tab view and click on the corresponding experiment. Each of the runs in that experiment are then accessible from the list view. Click on the appropriate run to access its history page, and the fairness dashboard will be available on the 'Fairness' tab.

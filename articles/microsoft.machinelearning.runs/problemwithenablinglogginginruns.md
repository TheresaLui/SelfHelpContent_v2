# Problem with enabling logging in runs

Most users are able to resolve issues with enabling loggin in runs by using the following information.

## **Recommended Steps**

### Using the Azure ML SDK for logging
For interactive logging and logging metrics in remote runs using the Azure ML logging APIs, see [Enable logging in Azure ML training runs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-track-experiments).

#### Metric document is too large
Azure Machine Learning has internal limits on the size of metric objects that can be logged at once from a training run. If you encounter a "Metric Document is too large" error when logging a list-valued metric, try splitting the list into smaller chunks, for example:

```
run.log_list("my metric name", my_metric[:N])
run.log_list("my metric name", my_metric[N:])
```

Internally, Azure ML concatenates the blocks with the same metric name into a contiguous list.

### Using TensorBoard
If you want to use TensorBoard to visualize the metrics of your training runs, see [Visualize experiment runs and metrics with TensorBoard](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-tensorboard).

### Using MLFlow
For information on using MLFlow's tracking API to log metrics in your training runs, see [Track experiment runs with MLFlow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow).

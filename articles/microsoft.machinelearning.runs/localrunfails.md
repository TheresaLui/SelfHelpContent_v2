# Local run fails

## **Recommended Documents**

To submit a run locally in a user-specified Python environment, or in Azure ML system-managed conda environment, see the [Train on local](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-local/train-on-local.ipynb) sample notebook.

For more information on configuring a run, see [Configure and submit training runs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-training-targets).

### Docker-based execution
If you want to run your training code locally in a Docker container, make sure the Docker engine is installed on the machine. See the [Train on local](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-local/train-on-local.ipynb) sample notebook for an example of a Docker-based local run.

First, determine if the customer is using DDoS Protection Standard SKU or not. This is very [easy to do](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureNetworking/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/300601/TSG-Determine-Customer's-DDoS-SKU). It can be located in ASC as a resourceType for quick identification. If you see Microsoft.Network/ddosProtectionPlans listed in ASC, it's DDoS Protection Standard customer.

**Important**: If the customer has an ARR support contract then the case will stay with ARR regardless of DDoS Basic or Standard.  Please check this before sending to the PODs.

**NOTE:** Anything under 10k packets/sec is NOT considered a DDoS by Microsoft's definition. Customers will need to scale their resources to handle this, as DDoS Protection Standard cannot protect below this figure.

**NOTE:** Azure also currently provides protection against layer 3 (L3) and layer 4 (L4) DDoS attacks, which include TCP SYN, New Connections, UDP/ICMP/TCP floods. All Azure endpoint VIPs (/32) are guarded at platform safe thresholds.â€¯The protection extends to traffic flows inbound from the internet, outbound to the internet, and from region to region. In addition, Azure currently does not provide layer 7 (L7) protection. So having a good L7 defense strategy in place is recommended.

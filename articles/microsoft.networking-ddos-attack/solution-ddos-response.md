# DDoS Attack Response
<!--issueDescription-->
We have reviewed your case and have escalated the issue to our DDoS Rapid Response team to mitigate the attack.

For DDoS Basic customers, the first step to enable protection is to turn on Azure DDoS Protection Standard.The document below provides guidance on how to do that. This feature is utilization based, with no commitment, so you can turn it on and off as needed during the attack.

# Can't connect MariaDB database server

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your connection issues to your MariaDB server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our initial investigation we determined that the server was restarted between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->, causing <!--$Count-->Count<!--/$Count--> connection attempts to fail. We have forwarded the issue to the MariaDB engineering team for further investigation. We will reach back out to you with more information shortly.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

As the service cannot entirely prevent transient connection failures like the one above from happening, we encourage all customers to implement retry logic. Please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-connectivity) for more details.

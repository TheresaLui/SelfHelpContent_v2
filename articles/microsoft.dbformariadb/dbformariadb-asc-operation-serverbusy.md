# Operation on MariaDB failed because server is busy with other operations.

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support team. We have detected that your operation on Azure Database for MariaDB server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName--> is failed because your server is currently busy with other operations. Please wait for the server to be in ready state and retry your operation.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you are using Azure portal, please check the server "Activity log" menu and make sure your previous operation succeeded and try your operation again.
* If you are using Azure CLI, you can use the following command to get the state of your server:
	az mariadb server show --resource-group <resource group name> --name <server name> --subscription <subscription id>
and wait for the "userVisibleState" to be in ready state: 
	"userVisibleState": "Ready"

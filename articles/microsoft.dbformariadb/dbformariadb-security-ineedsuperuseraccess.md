User permissions for database user are managed through the MariaDB built-in user management capabilities. Please note that super user access cannot be granted in the managed service.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you lose your admin account password, or you need to change the password for any reason follow the [reset password article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-create-manage-server-portal#update-admin-password) to manage your admin account.
* For more information on how to manage users and roles in MariaDB, please refer to the public MariaDB community edition documentation for the MariaDB version you are using

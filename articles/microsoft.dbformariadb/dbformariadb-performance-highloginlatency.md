# Troubleshooting login performance in Azure Database for MariaDB

Slow login issues can have many different root causes. Work through the recommended steps to solve for the most common issues.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Monitor the resource consumption of your server. If you max out either I/O or compute resources, increase scale up the resource that you are limited on.
* If your client is hosted in an Azure VM, turn on accelerated networking for lowest connection latency
* Use connection pooling on the client whenever possible to avoid overhead for establishing new connections

# Managing VNet services endpoints for your Azure Database for MariaDB servers

Virtual Network (VNet) services endpoints and rules extend the private address space of a Virtual Network to your Azure Database for MariaDB server.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure that your Azure Database for MariaDB is deployed in General Purpose and Memory Optimized servers. The Basic tier does not support VNet service endpoints.
* If the Azure resources being connected via service endpoints are across two subscriptions, make sure that the two subscriptions are in same Active directory tenant and both of them have **Microsoft.SQL** resource provider registered

# Migration tools for Azure Database for MariaDB

There are many different ways a database server can be migrated. The best solution depends on many factors including: How much data needs to be moved, can downtime be tolerated, does your application move as well, where your current server is location (on-premises, in a virtual machine, in a different cloud), and more.

Most question around migration tools and recommendations can be solved by working through the recommended steps.

  * If you encountered the "MySQL server has gone away" error, increase the value of the *max_allowed_packet* parameter to higher value (like *1234567899*) in portal first and then add the *max_allowed_packet* parameter in your mysqldump command: *$ mysqldump --max-allowed-packet=1234567899 -u root -p testdb > testdb_backup.sql*.
  * Make sure all tables in the database use the InnoDB storage engine when loading data into Azure Database for MariaDB

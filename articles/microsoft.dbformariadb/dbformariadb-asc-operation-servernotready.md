# Operation on MariaDB failed because the backend is not ready to perform it.

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support team. We have detected that your operation on MariaDB server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName--> is timed out because the backend is not ready to perform it. Please wait for the server to be in ready state and retry your operation.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you are using Azure portal, please check the server "Activity log" menu and make sure your previous operation succeeded and try your operation again
* If you are using Azure CLI, you can use `az mariadb server show --resource-group <resource group name> --name <server name> --subscription <subscription id>` to get the state of your server
* Wait for "userVisibleState" to read "Ready"
* If you are using ARM template, please make sure you execute your operations in serial. If deployment order is not specified, the Resource Manager deploys them in parallel. See how to [Define the order for deploying resources in Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-define-dependencies).

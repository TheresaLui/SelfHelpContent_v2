# Connecting to Azure Databases for MariaDB

Azure Database for MariaDB uses the community edition of MariaDB. As such, most drivers and tools are able to connect to the service. There are, however, some limitations in functionality because Azure database for MariaDB is a fully managed platform as a service.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Check the current known [limitations of the service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-limits) to see if your scenario is not supported
* Review the list of officially [supported drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-compatibility) to make sure you are using a supported driver version

## **Recommended Documents**

* [Connect with Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/connect-workbench)

# Managing firewall rules for Azure Database for MariaDB

Server-level firewall rules are used to manage access to your Azure Database for MariaDB Server. You can specify specific IP address or a range of IP addresses. These Firewall rules can be managed through the Azure [portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-manage-firewall-portal), the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-manage-firewall-cli), and our [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/mariadb/).

Most users are able to resolve their issue using the steps below.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you cannot connect after setting up a firewall rule for your client:

  * Make sure your security credentials are valid in case you are seeing the authentication errors
  * Validate that the firewall on the client allows outbound traffic on the required ports
  * If you client does not have a static IP address, your IP address might not be covered by the firewall rule

* There may be as much as a five-minute delay for changes to the Azure Database for MariaDB Server firewall configuration to take effect. Confirm your rule was added and re-try to connect for at least 5 minutes.
* If you are having trouble using Azure CLI:

  * Make sure you are signed-in to the correct using **az login**
  * Ensure you are using the correct subscription, in case you have more than one
  * Specify all required parameters in **az mariadb server firewall-rule** with valid values. Review the [Azure CLI MariaDB firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/mariadb/server/firewall-rule?view=azure-cli-latest) documentation for valid parameters.

* If you are deploying firewall rules using ARM templates:

  * Familiarize yourself with [Create Azure Database for MariaDB with multiple firewall rules](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mariadb/tree/master/arm-templates/ExampleWithFirewallRule) ARM template
  * If you are deploying or updating multiple server attributes which includes firewall rules, Virtual Network rules, server parameters or databases for a given server, make sure you are deploying these serially, in any order. Familiarize yourself with [Sample ARM templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mariadb/tree/master/arm-templates/ExampleWithMultipleServerProperties).

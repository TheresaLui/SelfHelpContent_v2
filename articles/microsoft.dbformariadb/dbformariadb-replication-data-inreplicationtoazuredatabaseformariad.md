# Replicate data from on-prem or VM to an Azure Database for MariaDB server

Data-in Replication allows you to synchronize data from a MariaDB server running on-premises, in virtual machines, or database services hosted by other cloud providers into the Azure Database for MariaDB service. Data-in Replication is based on the binary log (binlog) file position-based replication native to MariaDB.

## **Recommended steps**

* Review [considerations and limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-data-in-replication#limitations-and-considerations) of data-in replication.
* Review how to configure [data-in replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-data-in-replication).
* If the master server has SSL enabled, ensure the SSL CA certificate provided for the domain has been included in the "mariadb.az_replication_change_master" stored procedure. Refer to the following [examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-data-in-replication#link-the-master-and-replica-servers-to-start-data-in-replication) and the "master_ssl_ca" parameter.
* Ensure the master server's IP address has been added to the Azure Database for MariaDB replica server's firewall rules. Update firewall rules using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-manage-firewall-portal) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-manage-firewall-cli).
* Ensure the machine hosting the master server allows both inbound and outbound traffic on port 3306.

# Backups and restore options for Azure Database for MariaDB

Geo-redundant backups can be configured at the time an Azure Database for MariaDB server is created. If configured, the last known good backup is geo-redundantly store and a new server can be created in a different Azure region. Geo-restore does not allow you to chose a point in time, but rather always restores to the last known good state. Restoring individual databases within a server are not supported.

## **Recommended Steps**

* If you try to restore a server in a different region and you are not seeing backups to restore from, make sure that the source server was created with geo-redundant backups turned on
* Review the [Azure Database for MariaDB business continuity overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-business-continuity) to understand estimated restore times and restore point objectives
* Review the [Azure Database for MariaDB backup and restore concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-backup) to understand supported functionality and regional coverage
* If you want to export the MariaDB database, review [How to export MariaDB database using PHPMyAdmin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-migrate-dump-restore#export-using-phpmyadmin)

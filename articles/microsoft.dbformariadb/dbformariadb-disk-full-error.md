# Orcas MariaDB Server marked read-only because the server storage is full

During our investigation we determined that the database server was marked as read-only. When a server is marked as read-only, all new transactions that try to write to the server are expected to fail. Read queries will continue to work uninterrupted.

Servers with less than 100 GB provisioned storage are marked read-only if the free storage is less than 512MB or 5% of the provisioned storage size. Servers with more than 100 GB provisioned storage are marked read only when the free storage is less than 5 GB. For example:

1. If you have provisioned 110 GB of storage, and the actual utilization goes over 105 GB, the server is marked read-only.
2. Alternatively, if you have provisioned 5 GB of storage, the server is marked read-only when the free storage reaches less than 512 MB.

The server will automatically be set to read/write again, when at least 5 GB of storage or 5% of the provisioned storage is free again.

## **Recommended Steps**

1. To fix this issue, please increase the storage size using the portal as described in [reaching storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/concepts-pricing-tiers)
2. You can increase the storage in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) by clicking on the "Pricing Tier" and then scale up the storage as per your requirement

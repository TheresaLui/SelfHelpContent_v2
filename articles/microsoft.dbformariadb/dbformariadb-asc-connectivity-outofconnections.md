# Can't connect MariaDB database server because of running out of connections

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your connection issues to your MariaDB server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that <!--$Count-->Count<!--/$Count--> connection attempts to fail due to connections to your database server have been running out between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* Try to reduce the number of concurrent connections by closing idle connections. We recommend using a [connection pooler](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-connectivity#access-databases-by-using-connection-pooling-recommended) to manage connections.
* Ensure you have chosen a compute tier that can support the maximum number of connections required by the application

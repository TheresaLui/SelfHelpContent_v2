# Troubleshooting unexpected increase in resource consumption

Increase in resource consumption can be a result of an explicit user action or changes in the workload.

## **Recommended Steps**

* Ensure there are no changes to the pricing-tier of your service that might have triggered it
* Adjust the pricing-tier commensurate to the increase in the workload
* Check if there are any schema changes, for example was an index dropped
* Ensure that the statistics are up to date

# Server is facing high IO Throttle

<!--issueDescription-->
Thank you for contacting Microsoft support about your performance issues with your MariaDB server <!--$ServerName-->ServerName<!--/$ServerName-->. During our investigation we found that your IO throttle is above 100 for more than 60 minutes between <!--$StartTime-->StartTime<!--/$StartTime--> and <!--$EndTime-->EndTime<!--/$EndTime-->. This means there are storage issues.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

* Consider increasing IOPS by scaling storage size. You can increase the storage in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) by clicking on the "Pricing Tier" and then scale up the storage as per your requirement.
* You can also enable [Auto-Grow feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-auto-grow-storage-portal), to avoid this issue in the future.

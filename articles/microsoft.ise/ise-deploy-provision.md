# Integrated Service Environment - Deploying and Provisioning

For scenarios where your logic apps and integration accounts need access to an Azure virtual network, create an integration service environment (ISE). An ISE is a dedicated environment that uses dedicated storage and other resources that are kept separate from the "global" multi-tenant Logic Apps service.

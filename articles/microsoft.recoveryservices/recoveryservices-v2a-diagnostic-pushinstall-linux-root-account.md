# Push installation of mobility agent fails because root account isn't provided in Linux VM

<!--issueDescription-->
The push installation of the mobility agent on Linux virtual machines fails because a built-in root account has not been provided.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Verify that the account provided is built-in root user account and retry the operation.
2. Check the following points before proceeding further:
    - Ensure that you are using valid credentials with administrative privileges. For detailed instructions, see [Credentials check (ErrorID: 95107 & 95108)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#credentials-check-errorid-95107--95108).
    - [Enable file & print sharing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#file-and-printer-sharing-services-check-errorid-95105--95106).
    - [Enable WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#windows-management-instrumentation-wmi-configuration-check-error-code-95103).
3. **OR** Install mobility agent on the source machine through [simple manual installation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-install-mobility-service#install-mobility-service-manually-by-using-the-gui) or by using a software deployment tool like [SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr).

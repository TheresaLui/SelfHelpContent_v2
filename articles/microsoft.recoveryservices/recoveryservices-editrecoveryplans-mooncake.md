# How to migrate virtual machines to Azure

## **Recommended steps**

You can migrate virtual machines to Azure and gesture to keep them in Azure forever. You do this by triggering a complete migration job on the failed over VM from the ASR portal. This capability is not available at a recovery plan level and you need to complete migration at individual virtual machines.</br>
Refer to the following documents to understand how to complete migration.</br>

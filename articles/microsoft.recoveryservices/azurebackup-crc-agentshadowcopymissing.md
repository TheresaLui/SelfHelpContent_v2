# Error AgentShadowCopyMissing

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your backup operation failed because of insufficient shadow copy space in the selected backup volume(s).
<!--/issueDescription-->


## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve this issue, perform the below:

- Increase Shadow copy storage space for the affected volume(s) using the vssadmin tool, restart the VSS service and try again
- To resolve snapshot deleted due to high IO on the volume, try scheduling backup when there is low IOPS load (for ex. off-peak hours) on the source volumes

# Run a test failover in Site recovery - VMware to Azure
## **Recommended steps**

- Not enough **cores** available to failover? [Follow these steps to increase the quota ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/resource-manager-core-quotas-request)<br>
- How to [run a **Test Failover** to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure) and [**connect to VM** after failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure#prepare-to-connect-to-azure-vms-after-failover)<br>

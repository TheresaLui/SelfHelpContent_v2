# Advisory questions related to Recovery Services Vault

Use the following guidelines when working with Recovery Services Vault

## **Recommended Steps**

**Delete a vault or Protected Items**<br>
You cannot delete a vault that contains protected data sources, backup data (active or in soft deleted state), or registered storage accounts.<br>
To delete the vault, refer to the following articles:
- [Step-by-step instructions to permanently delete the vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-delete-vault#proper-way-to-delete-a-vault)<br>
- Check if soft deleted items are blocking vault delete and [learn how to disable it](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-security-feature-cloud#disabling-soft-delete-using-azure-portal)
- Determine whether backup infrastructure items are blocking vault delete by ensuring that no protected items are on the following path: <br>
     **Vault - Backup infrastructure** under **Protected Servers** and **Storage Accounts** tab. <br> 
See instructions on how to stop backup/protection for:
    * [Azure Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-manage-vms#stop-protecting-a-vm)<br>
    * [SQL databases in Azure Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/manage-monitor-sql-database-backup#stop-protection-for-a-sql-server-database)<br>
    * [Azure File Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/manage-afs-backup#stop-protection-on-a-file-share)<br>

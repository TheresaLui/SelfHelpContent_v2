# UserErrorBackupFailedAsRemedialBackupInProgress 

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your backup operation failed because there is already another remedial full backup is in progress.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

-	If you trigger a backup while another full backup is still running it will cause a mismatch of the previous log backup to the current log backup.
-	Verify if multiple backups have been triggered from HANA native clients.  Wait for the remedial backup job to complete before triggering another backup.

# Azure Recovery Services Agent installation or registration issues

## **Recommended Steps**

- [Ensure the OS is supported and has the latest updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix-mars-agent#supported-operating-systems)
- [Ensure Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent is up to date before troubleshooting further](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/upgrade-mars-agent)
- [Ensure there is network connectivity between MARS agent and Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-mars-troubleshoot#the-microsoft-azure-recovery-service-agent-was-unable-to-connect-to-microsoft-azure-backup) <br>
- Ensure **System Clock** on the protected system is configured to correct time zone <br>
- If you are trying to **reregister your server** to a vault, then: <br>
  - Ensure the agent is uninstalled on the server and it is deleted from portal <br> 
  - Use the same passphrase that was initially used for registering the server <br>
- Ensure your OS has the latest updates <br>
- [Ensure that the server has at least .Net Framework version 4.5.2 and higher](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653)<br>
- [Invalid vault credentials provided: The file is either corrupted or does not have the latest information](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwts) <br>
- [The Microsoft Azure Recovery Service Agent was unable to connect to Microsoft Azure Backup](https://aka.ms/AB-A4dp50) <br>
- [Failed to set the encryption key for secure backups](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dp56) <br>
- [The encryption passphrase stored on this computer is not correctly configured](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4dwto) <br>
- **The activation did not complete successfully**: [Ensure you are not surpassing the supported limit of MARS and MABS registered to a single vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix#vault-support)

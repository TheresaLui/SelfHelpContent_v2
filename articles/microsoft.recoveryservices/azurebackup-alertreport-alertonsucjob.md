## **Recommended Documents**

- [Create alerts using Log Analytics](https://aka.ms/Create-Alert-LA)
- [Configure notifications for alerts generated using Log Analytics](https://aka.ms/BKP-LA-Notification)
- To configure alert and notification on successful backup jobs, use query [all successful backup jobs](https://aka.ms/BKP-Alerts-AllSuccessfulJobs) while defining [alert condition](https://aka.ms/backup-Alert-condition) in Log Analytics <br>
- You can also use [Activity Logs](https://aka.ms/Configure-AlertsNotification-ActivityLogs) to get notifications for events such as backup success for Azure VMs. Please read [recommendations](https://aka.ms/BKP-Notification-Recommendations) before configuring notification using Activity Logs.

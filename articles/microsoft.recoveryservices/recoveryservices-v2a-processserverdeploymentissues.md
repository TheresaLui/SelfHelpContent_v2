# Site Recovery (VMware to Azure)/ Process Server deployment and issues.

Common issues during Process Server deployment

## **Recommended Steps**
* Ensure that the Process Server is deployed in the same network as the virtual machines you want to protect/re-protect.
* If you are deploying an Process Server in Azure, ensure you choose the correct deployment model for your process server. Resource manager virtual machines cannot be Re-protected by a Classic model Process Server and vice versa.
* If you are deploying a Process Server in Azure, ensure you [register it with the Configuration Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-vmware-setup-azure-ps-resource-manager#registering-the-process-server-running-in-azure-to-a-configuration-server-running-on-premises) before you proceed to use it for Re-protecting virtual machines.

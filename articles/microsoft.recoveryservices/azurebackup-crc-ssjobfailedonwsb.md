# Error SSJobFailedOnWSB  

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified your backup operation failed because of  interference of any anti-virus.Â 
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended steps**
- Ensure VM has the latest backup agent installed
- Ensure all VSS Writer issues are resolved (if any in event log) 
- Anti-virus software if installed can interfere with System State Backup. To verify if anti-virus is the root cause, temporarily disable it and retry the operation.

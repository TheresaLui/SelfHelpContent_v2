# WindowsGuestAgentStatusUnavailable

<!--issueDescription-->
**Backup operation failed due to guest agent issue**
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
We have identified that your backup operation failed due to one of the reason mentioned in the troubleshooting steps.

1. Ensure the Guest Agent status is Ready; however if the Guest Agent status is not Ready, perform the below steps:

	- Make sure the below services are running in the VM services (services.msc)
		* RDAgent
		* Windows Azure Guest Agent
		* Windows Azure Telemetry Service
	- Restart the Windows Guest Agent service and initiate the backup operation.
	- Update Guest Agent to latest version.
2. Ensure the VM should is connected to the Azure storage account. If there are any network restriction in place (NSG, Proxy etc.) and to allow connectivity to the Azure storage account.
3. Backup fails due to the Extension files that were modified and corrupted on VM. To resolved this issue perform the below steps:

	- Extract the contents of Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot_<LatestVersion>.zip from the path C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot\<LatestVersion> with replace-files option.
	- Extract files in the same path and run the ` REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgent" /v IsProviderInstalled /t REG_SZ /d False /f ` command from elevated command prompt to enforce Extension reinstall.
4. Ensure there are no Antivirus restrictions. If in the **Event Viewer Application** logs at the time of backup if it displays the message *Faulting application name: IaaSBcdrExtension.exe* then it is confirmed that the antivirus configured in the VM is restricting the execution of backup extension. To resolve this issue exclude below directories and retry the backup operation.

	- C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot
	- C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot

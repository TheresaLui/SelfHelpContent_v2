# Unable to Configure Backup for Azure  Virtual Machines?
## **Recommended steps**
To resolve the most common issues, try one or more of the following steps.<br>

**VM agent is unable to communicate with the Azure Backup Service?** <br>
This issue may occur if the VM Agent service is missing/not in running status (verify it from services.msc of your VM) in Azure Virtual Machine. Try to restart VM agent /[re-install](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409) it to resolve the issue <br>
Follow the [troubleshooting steps](https://aka.ms/guestagent-status-unavailable) to resolve such communication issues <br>

**Azure Backup does not support disk sizes greater than 1023GB?** <br>
This issue may occur if the virtual machine has the disk size [greater than 1 TB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare#limitations-when-backing-up-and-restoring-a-vm). 

We have a private preview to support backups for VMs with >1TB unmanaged disks. For details refer to [Private preview for large disk VM backup support](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Instant-recovery-point-and-25fe398a)
If you do not wish to join the preview or have managed disks, follow below steps to resolve this issue : <br>
* If you have disks greater than 1 TB , [attach new disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-managed-disk-portal) which are less than 1 TB
*	Then, copy the data from disk greater than 1TB into newly created disk(s) of size less than 1TB.
* Ensure that all data has been copied and remove the disks greater than 1TB
* Initiate the backup. <br>

# Azure Recovery Services Agent installation or registration issues

## **Recommended Steps**

- [Ensure there is network connectivity between MARS agent and Azure](https://docs.azure.cn/backup/backup-azure-mars-troubleshoot#the-microsoft-azure-recovery-service-agent-was-unable-to-connect-to-microsoft-azure-backup)
- Ensure **System Clock** on the protected system is configured to correct time zone
- If you are trying to **reregister your server** to a vault, then:

  - Ensure the agent is uninstalled on the server and it is deleted from portal
  - Use the same passphrase that was initially used for registering the server
- Ensure your OS has the latest updates
- [Ensure that the server has at least .Net Framework version 4.5.2 and higher](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653)
- [Invalid vault credentials provided: The file is either corrupted or does not have the latest information](https://docs.azure.cn/backup/backup-azure-mars-troubleshoot#invalid-vault-credentials-provided)

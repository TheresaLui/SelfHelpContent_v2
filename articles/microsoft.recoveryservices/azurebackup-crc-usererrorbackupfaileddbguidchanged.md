# Error UserErrorBackupFailedDBGuidChanged

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your Log/Differential backup failed because database GUID has changed since the last successful full backup.Â 
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve this issue, perfom the below steps:

* If scheduled Differential/Log backups fails with this issue, Azure Backup uses auto-heal to trigger a remedial full backup. No further action is required.
* If adhoc Differential/Log backups fails with this issue, then ensure a full backup is taken. Otherwise, all subsequent adhoc Diff/Log backups will continue to fail with this error code.

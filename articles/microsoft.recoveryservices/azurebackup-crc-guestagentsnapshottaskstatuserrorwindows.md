# GuestAgentSnapshotTaskStatusErrorWindows

<!--issueDescription-->

## **Could not communicate with the VM agent for snapshot status**
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

We have identified that your backup operation might have failed, because our backup service could not communicate with the VM agent. To resolve this issue, follow the below steps:

- Guest agent might be outdated, stopped or unresponsive. Follow [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-troubleshoot-vm-backup-fails-snapshot-timeout#the-agent-installed-in-the-vm-is-out-of-date-for-linux-vms) instructions to update and restart the agent
- [Ensure Backup extension running on the VM has outbound access to Azure public IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare#establish-network-connectivity)
- Backup operation could fail if the backup extension is in an inconsistent state. To resolve this issue reinstall the extension by follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-troubleshoot-vm-backup-fails-snapshot-timeout#the-backup-extension-fails-to-update-or-load) and retry the operation

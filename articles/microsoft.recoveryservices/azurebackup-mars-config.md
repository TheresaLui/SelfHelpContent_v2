# Install and Registration failures for Files and Folders backup

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve common install and registration issues, choose the symptom you are observing:

If the subscription has not expired but you are still facing this error, run the following command in Azure Powershell in the context of the concerned subscription: `Register-AzureRmResourceProvider-ProviderNamespace Microsoft.RecoveryServices`
	
Wait for 30mins to check the status using the command `Get-AzureRmResourceProvider-ProviderNamespace Microsoft.RecoveryServices`
	
- [Failed to set the encryption key for secure backups](https://aka.ms/MABAgentEncryptionKeyError)
- [The Microsoft Azure Recovery Service Agent was unable to connect to Microsoft Azure Backup](https://aka.ms/MABagentUnableToConnect)
- [The activation did not complete successfully. The current operation failed due to an internal service error.](https://aka.ms/MABAgentActivationError)

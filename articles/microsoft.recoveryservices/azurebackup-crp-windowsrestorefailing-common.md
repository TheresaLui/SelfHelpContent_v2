# Azure Backup - Restore is failing

## **Recommended Steps**

**Known Limitations**

- Restoring backed-up VMs across Zone/Region/subscription or V-Net is not supported. For more information, see [supported scenarios](https://aka.ms/VMBackup-Support-VMManagement) for VM management.
- Files/Folders restore limitation on having special configuration [**Dynamic Disks or LVM/RAID Arrays**](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4ecqw)
- Restore disks will restore all disks (OS and data disks attached to the VM). Individual disk restore is not available using this option.
- Replacing an existing virtual machine during restore is not supported. You can use one of the following restore options:

	- [Replace disks of existing backed-up VM](https://aka.ms/VMRestore-ReplaceExisting-disks)<br>
	- [Restore disks](https://aka.ms/VMrestore-restore-disk) and create a new VM using [Templates](https://aka.ms/templates-to-customize-a-restored-vm) or [PowerShell](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4e56j)
	- [Restore as a new VM](https://aka.ms/AzureBackup-Restore-NewVM)

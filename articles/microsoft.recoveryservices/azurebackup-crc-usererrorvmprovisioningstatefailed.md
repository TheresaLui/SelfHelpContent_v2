# Error UserErrorVmProvisioningStateFailed

<!--issueDescription-->
We identified that your backup operation failed due to the VM being in a failed provisioning state. This error can occur if any of one of the extensions fail, leaving the VM in a failed provisioned state. To resolve the "UserErrorVmProvisioningStateFailed" issue, ensure that the VM is running or in a shut-down state for the backup operation to succeed. If the VM requires a pending restart, restart and retry the operation.

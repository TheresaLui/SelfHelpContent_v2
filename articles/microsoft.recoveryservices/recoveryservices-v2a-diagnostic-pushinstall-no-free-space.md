# Push installation of mobility agent fails with insufficient free space

<!--issueDescription-->
Push installation fails because the C: drive on the source machine doesn’t have enough free space for the push install service to copy the mobility agent software.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Ensure that the C: drive on the source machine has at least 100 MB of free space available and retry the operation.
2. [Enable WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#windows-management-instrumentation-wmi-configuration-check-error-code-95103).
3. **OR** Install mobility agent on the source machine through [simple manual installation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-install-mobility-service#install-mobility-service-manually-by-using-the-gui) or by using a software deployment tool like [SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr).

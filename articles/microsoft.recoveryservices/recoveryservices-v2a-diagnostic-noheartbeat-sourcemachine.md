2. Login to Source Machine with administrator privileges
3. Verify that the service **svagents** and **InMage Scout Application Service** are running and then start or restart the services
4. On the Source Machine, check the following log for any errors in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\agent\\svagents*log

- The license provided with an OVA template is an evaluation license valid for 180 days. Before expiration, you need to activate the license. Otherwise, it can result in frequent shutdown of the configuration server and cause a hindrance to replication activities. For more information, see: [Manage the configuration server for VMware VM disaster recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-manage-configuration-server#update-windows-license).

# Enable replication failed as virtual machine's disk size is not meet the requirement
<!--issueDescription-->
Failed to enable replication for the virtual machine <!--$vmname-->[vmname]<!--/$vmname--> with error 28109. This problem can occur if the disk size is smaller than the minimum size required, or the disk type is unsupported such as BitLocker encrypted disk.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the disk size of the virtual machine is larger than 1 GB. To resize the disk size, see [How to expand the disk of a virtual machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk#resize-a-managed-disk).
2. Remove the BitLocker encrypted disk or turn off the encryption

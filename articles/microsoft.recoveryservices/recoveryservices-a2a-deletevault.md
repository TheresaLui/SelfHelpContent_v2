# Delete a vault in A2A scenario

## **Recommended steps**

- [I am unable to delete the recovery service vault](https://aka.ms/Delete_RecoveryService_Vault) </br>
- [I want to forcefully delete the recovery service vault](https://aka.ms/ForceDelete_RecoveryService_Vault) </br>
Note: Force delete will rapidly remove the vault and all its dependencies!<br>
- Moving Recovery services vault to different subscription is not supported.

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Verify the data tracking module status. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Login to Source Machine as user root
2. Verify the Linux kernel version (ex: # uname -r) is supported by the currently installed ASR Mobility Service version
3. Upgrade to the latest Mobility Service version that [supports for the kernel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix#replicated-machine-operating-systems) if required
4. On the Source Machine, check the following log for any errors in "/var/log/svagents*log"

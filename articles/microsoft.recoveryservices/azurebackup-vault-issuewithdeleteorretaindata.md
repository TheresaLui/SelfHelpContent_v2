# Issue with delete or retain backed-up data

## **Recommended Steps**

* Deletion Failed: There are backup items associated with the server. Stop protection and [delete backups for each of the backup items](https://aka.ms/DeleteBackupItems) to delete the server's registration. If the issue persists, contact support.
	
* Navigate to your on-premises server Management Console (MARS, Azure Backup Server or SC DPM depending on where your back items are protected) and perform the steps listed in [Deleting backup items from management console](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-delete-vault#deleting-backup-items-from-management-console)

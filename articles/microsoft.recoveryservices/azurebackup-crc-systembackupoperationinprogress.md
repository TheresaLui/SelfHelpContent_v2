# SystemBackupOperationInProgress

<!--issueDescription-->
## We have identified that your recent backup job failed because there is an existing backup job in progress. You cannot start a new backup job until the current job finishes
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve this issue ensure the backup operation currently in progress is completed before triggering or scheduling other backup operations. To check the backup jobs status:

1. Sign in to Azure portal and click **All services**. Type Recovery Services and click **Recovery Services vaults**. The list of recovery services vaults appears.
2. From the list of recovery services vaults, select a vault in which the backup is configured
3. On the vault dashboard menu, click **Backup Jobs** to display all the backup jobs

	* If a backup job is in progress, wait for it to complete or cancel the backup job
	* To cancel the backup job, right-click on the backup job and click **Cancel** or use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.backup/stop-azurermbackupjob?view=azurermps-6.13.0&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-6.12.0)
	* If you have reconfigured the backup in a different vault, ensure there are no backup jobs running in the old vault

4. Retry backup operation

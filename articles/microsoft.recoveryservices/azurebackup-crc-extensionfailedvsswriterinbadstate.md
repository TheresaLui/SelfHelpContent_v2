# Error ExtensionFailedVssWriterInBadState

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your snapshot operation failed due to the VSS (Volume Shadow copy Service) writer in a bad state.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Step 1. Restart VSS writers that are in a bad state.

* From an elevated command prompt, run <br>
```vssadmin list writers```.
* The output contains all VSS writers and their state. For every VSS writer with a state that's not **[1] Stable**, restart the respective VSS writer's service.
* To restart the service, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

 ```net stop serviceName``` <br>
 ```net start serviceName```
M
>**Note:** Restarting some services can have an impact on your production environment. Make sure to follow the approval process and restart the service at the scheduled downtime.

Step 2: If restarting the VSS writers did not resolve the issue, run the following command as an administrator from an elevated command-prompt to prevent the threads from being created for blob-snapshots.

```
console 
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v SnapshotWithoutThreads /t REG_SZ /d True /f
```

If steps 1 and 2 did not resolve the issue, follow the instructions in Step 3 of this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-troubleshoot#extensionfailedvsswriterinbadstate---snapshot-operation-failed-because-vss-writers-were-in-a-bad-state)

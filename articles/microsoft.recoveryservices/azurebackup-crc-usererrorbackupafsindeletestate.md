# UserErrorBackupAFSInDeleteState

<!--issueDescription-->
The file shares blade is displaying the item state by recovering data based on the friendly name, causing a view corresponding to the deleted file share and not the newly created file share having the same friendly name. This inconsistency is not present in the vault blade. The issue will be resolved in the upcoming releases.

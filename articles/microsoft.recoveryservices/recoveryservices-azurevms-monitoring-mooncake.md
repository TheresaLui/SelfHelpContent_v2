# Azure virtual machine backup monitoring and reporting issues

## **Recommended steps**
Try the recommended steps below to resolve common issues with Azure IaaS VM Backup monitoring and reporting

* Note that alerts are raised only for failed backups

* If the email did not reach your inbox, please check in the spam or junk folders

* Are there situations where email isn't sent even if notifications are configured? Below are situations where an alert is not raised and email is not sent to reduce alert-noise<br>
	1. If notifications are configured to Hourly Digest, and an alert is raised and resolved within the hour <br>
	2. The job is canceled <br>
	3. A backup job is triggered and then fails, and another backup job is in progress <br>
	4. A scheduled backup job for a Resource Manager-enabled VM starts, but the VM no longer exists <br>

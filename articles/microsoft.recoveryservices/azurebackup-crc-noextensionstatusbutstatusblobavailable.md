# Error AzureIaaSVMRecoveryPerfDiskNumberGreaterThan8

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your backup operation failed because IaaS VM (with Linux OS) backup extension execution was stuck or crashed or the system calls might have timed out.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. Check if the VM is Linux and has more number of disks (disks count greater than 4). If yes, turn on sequential snapshot by following the below steps:

    -	Go to file */etc/azure/vmbackup.conf* and under [SnapshotThread]<br>
    -	Set the config value: *seqsnapshot = 2*
  
2. If the OS Version is Oracle Linux 7.6 and VM gets stuck during backup then please follow the below steps to mitigate the issue.

    -	Exclude temp disk from snapshots:<br>
    -	Check for mount path for Azure temporary disk. Generally it is */mnt/resources*
    -	Go to file */etc/azure/vmbackup.conf* and under [SnapshotThread]<br>
    -	Set the config value: *MountsToSkip = /mnt/resources*

<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Verify the heartbeat from Master Target. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Verify the Master Target machine is up and running.
2. Login to Master Target with administrator privileges.
3. Verify that the service **svagents** is running. And then, start or restart the service.
4. On the Master Target, check the following log for any errors in "C:\\ProgramData\\ASR\\agent\\svagents*log".

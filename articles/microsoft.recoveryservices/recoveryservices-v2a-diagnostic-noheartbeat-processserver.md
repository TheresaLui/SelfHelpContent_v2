# Replication is not progressing with no heartbeat from Process Server

<!--issueDescription-->
Replication status is critical because the Azure Site Recovery service on Process Server is not able to connect to Configuration Server.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Verify the heartbeat from Process Server. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Verify the Process Server machine is up and running
2. Login to Process Server with administrator privileges
3. Verify that the service **tmansvc** is running, then start or restart the service
4. On the Process Server, check the following logs for any errors:

    - C:\\ProgramData\\ASR\\home\\svsystems\\eventmanager*log
    - C:\\ProgramData\\ASR\\home\\svsystems\\monitor_protection*.log

## **Recommended Documents**

- Learn more about [troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-replication) application or crash consistency point generation failures
- Learn more about [monitoring requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-monitor-process-server#monitor-process-server-health) to avoid such issues in the future

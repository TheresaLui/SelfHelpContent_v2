# Replication is not progressing as Process Server is not reachable

<!--issueDescription-->
Replication status is critical because Azure Site Recovery agent on Source Machine is not able to connect to Process Server.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Verify the network connectivity from source VM to Process Server. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Verify the Process Server machine is up and running.
2. Login to Process Server with administrator privileges.
3. Verify that the service **cxprocessserver** is running. And then, start or restart the service.
4. Login to source VM with administrator (root user on Linux OS) privileges.
5. Run **cxpsclient** tool to check network connectivity: cxpsclient -i <Process_Server_IP> -l 9443 -v 2.
6. On the Process Server, check the following log for any errors "C:\\ProgramData\\ASR\\home\\svsystems\\transport\\log\\cxps*log".

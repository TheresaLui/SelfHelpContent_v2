# Your virtual machine is not able to reach process server
<!--issueDescription-->
Mobility agent installed on the server is not able to communicate with process server. Therefore, generation of crash and application consistency points is impacted.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

- Verify that the process server is up and [healthy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-troubleshoot-process-server#check-process-server-health).
- Verify that your virtual machine is up and running.
- Login to the process server as an administrator and restart the service "cxprocessserver".
- Login to the virtual machine as an administrator or root user and run "cxpsclient" tool to check the network connectivity. To do that, run "cxpsclient -i <ProcessServer_IP> -l 9443 -v 2".
- If the issue persists, check the log in "C:\ProgramData\ASR\home\svsystems\transport\log\cxps*log" on the process server for detailed error information.

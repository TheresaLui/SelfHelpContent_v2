# Replication not progressing - VMware/Physical to Azure

## **Recommended documents**
* Troubleshoot [Initial replication issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-protection-troubleshoot/) <br>
* Replication is stuck and not progressing? Follow this troubleshooting [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-replication)</br>
* Troubleshoot error message ['No application consistent recovery point available for the VM'](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srinathv/2018/01/11/troubleshooting-no-latest-app-consistent-snapshot-issues-for-vmware-to-azure-when-using-azure-site-recovery/)</br>
* VM is protected, but Replication health is critical? Check if current churn/bandwidth is meeting recommendations. Run the [Deployment planner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-vmware-deployment-planner-run) and review recommendations for [network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-vmware-deployment-planner-analyze-report#recommendations-with-available-bandwidth-as-input) and [storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-vmware-deployment-planner-analyze-report#vm-storage-placement) </br>
* Check if you need to adjust the bandwidth and throttling as listed in this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-plan-capacity-vmware#control-network-bandwidth) </br>

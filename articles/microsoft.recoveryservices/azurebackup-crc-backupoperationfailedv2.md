We have identified that your backup operation failed because the snapshot isn't triggered. To resolve this issue, follow [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-troubleshoot-vm-backup-fails-snapshot-timeout#backupoperationfailed--backupoperationfailedv2---backup-fails-with-an-internal-error) steps.

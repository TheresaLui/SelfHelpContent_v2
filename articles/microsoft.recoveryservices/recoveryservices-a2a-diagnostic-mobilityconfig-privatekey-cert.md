# Mobility service installation failed because Private Key is not found in certificate

<!--issueDescription-->
Mobility service installation fails with private key not found error because the virtual machine is configured with a group policy that doesnâ€™t allow the local system administrator to import the private key from the certificate.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

Contact the system administrator to obtain required permission for the local administrator to import the private key from certificate store. Refer to [Default permissions for the MachineKeys folders](https://support.microsoft.com/help/278381).

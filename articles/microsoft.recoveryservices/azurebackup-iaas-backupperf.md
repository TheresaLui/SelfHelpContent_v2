# Azure virtual machine backups are running slow

## **Recommended steps**
- First backup time **can be greater than 24 hours**, it is proportional to size of source data. <br>
- Subsequent (i.e. incremental or daily) backup time **can take up to 24 hours** to complete. <br>
- Understand the [factors contributing to backup time.](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4ecqb) <br>
- Follow [best practices](https://aka.ms/AB-AA4e56d) to optimize backup performance. <br>

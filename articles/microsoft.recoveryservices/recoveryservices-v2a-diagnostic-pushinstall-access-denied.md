# Push installation of mobility agent fails with Access Denied

<!--issueDescription-->
When the push install service tries to copy mobility agent software to the source machine from scale-out process server or configuration server, **access is denied** because the user account provided doesn't have the required **administrator privileges** on the source machine.
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**

1. The user account details selected during **Enable Replication** should be given **administrator privileges** over the source machine. For more information, see [Credentials check (ErrorID: 95107 & 95108)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#credentials-check-errorid-95107--95108).
2. Check the following points before proceeding further:

    - [Enable file & print sharing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#file-and-printer-sharing-services-check-errorid-95105--95106)
    - [Enable WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install#windows-management-instrumentation-wmi-configuration-check-error-code-95103)
3. **OR** Install mobility agent on the source machine through [simple manual installation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-install-mobility-service#install-mobility-service-manually-by-using-the-gui) or by using a software deployment tool like [SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr)

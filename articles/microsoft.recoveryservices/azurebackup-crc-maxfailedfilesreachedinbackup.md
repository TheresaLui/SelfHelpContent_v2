# Error MaxFailedFilesReachedInBackup

<!--issueDescription-->
We have identified that your backup operation failed, because the number of data transfer failures was more than the permissible failure count (i.e., current default is 1000 failures).
<!--/issueDescription-->

## **Recommended Steps**
To resolve this issue, perform the below troubleshooting steps and retry the operation:

* Ensure backup agent installed is latest
* Check if the volume where scratch space is configured exists (not deleted)
* Ensure the scratch folder is not full
* Ensure MARS agent is excluded from the antivirus installed on the machine
* Check if disk defragmentation is enabled on protected datasource volume. Test by disabling Disk defragmentation for the protected datasource and uncheck * Automatically Optimize new drives option and ensure the metadata VHD mounted is not getting defragmented

# Sponsorship Offer (36P)Fairfax Sponsorship (MS-AZR-USGov-0036P and MS-AZR-USGov-0143P)

1. There is no monthly credit cap. There is only an overall usage cap, which allows customers to spend Azure credits at their own pace up to the usage cap.
2. The Azure Sponsorship will end when the customer reaches either the usage cap or the duration of the scription has come to an end, whichever occurs first.
3. The subscriptions will automatically be converted into a PayG subscription at that time. Any remaining monetary credit from the sponsorship expires and does not carry forward and is not available for a refund.

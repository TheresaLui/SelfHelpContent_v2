Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer TSG 2658611

[Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer Expired Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions (243P) will not be automatically converted to Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658611)

If there is no PI and the customer wants to re-enable the subscription after it was disabled at the end of their term, the subscription can still be converted to a PAYG. At this time, the customer will need to remove the monetary cap, add a credit card to re-enable the subscription. If the customer doesn?t have the self-serve option, ASMS may need to re-enable the subscription on their behalf. See TSG 2647585 for guidance on how to convert a subscription.

For guidance on adding a credit card, reference Add, Update, or Remove a Credit or Debit Card for Azure.

If the customer is moving to an EA subscription or another offer (Offer Details) that doesn't require a credit card and needs to have a data migration completed, you can contact the Azure Pass team to have them provide a second pass with $50 of usage so that the subscription can be re-enabled during the migration phase and then disabled again, once complete.  

Note: EA customers with an active EA enrollment cannot sign up for Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions.
